Cell culture
HEK293Ta cells were purchased from GeneCopoeia and maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination by nested PCR using culture medium as a template.

Base-editing reporter cell lines
The C→T and A→G reporter circuits and their respective positive control circuits, containing the expected mutations, were introduced into human embryonic kidney HEK293Ta cells by lentiviral transduction. For lentiviral packaging, ~2 × 105 cells per well were seeded in a 6-well plate 1 day before transfection. In each packaging reaction, 489 ng of lentiviral plasmid was cotransfected with two helper plasmids, psPAX2 (Addgene 12260) and pMD2.G (Addgene 12259), at 366 ng and 122 ng, respectively, and 9.38 µl of 1 mg ml−1 polyethyleneimine MAX (PEI) (Polysciences) in 300 µl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The next day, the culture medium was changed to fresh medium, and 2 days later the culture supernatant containing lentiviral particles was harvested and aliquoted into 1.5-ml tubes. The viral sample was then stored at −80 °C before infection. For lentiviral infection, ~2 × 105 cells per well were seeded on a 6-well plate with 2 ml DMEM and incubated for 24 h. The viral supernatant was then thawed at room temperature, mixed with 1 µl of 8 mg ml−1 polybrene (Sigma), and added to each cell sample. One day after infection, ~5 × 103 infected cells were reseeded on a 96-well culture plate for functional titer measurement by the CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega). Two days after infection, 2.0 µg ml−1 puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the culture medium, followed by incubation for 3 days to select successfully transduced cells. After puromycin selection, absence of background fluorescence or EGFP expression was confirmed for the reporter cell lines and their corresponding positive control cell lines, respectively.

Transfection
EGFP reporter activation assays
Base-editing reporter cells and corresponding control cells were seeded in a collagen-I-coated 24-well plate (Asone) with 500 µl DMEM at a density of ~5 × 104 cells per well. The next day, 1.2 µl of 1 mg ml−1 PEI, 50 µl PBS, 300 ng base editor plasmid, and 100 ng gRNA expression plasmid were mixed and then incubated at room temperature for 20 min before application to each well for transfection. For each base editor mix experiment, two base editor plasmids were mixed at a 1:1 mass ratio and 300 ng was used (see Supplementary Note 2 for detail discussion about of the base editor mix experiments). Fluorescence imaging was performed 3 days after transfection using a confocal microscopy InCellAnalyzer6000 (GE Healthcare) with a ×20 objective lens. The experiment was performed in quadruplicates. For one of the replicates, cell nuclei were stained with 10 mg ml−1 Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Genomic on-target and off-target assays
HEK293Ta cells were seeded in a collagen-I-coated 96-well plate (Asone) with 200 µl DMEM at a density of ~5 × 103 cells per well. The next day, 0.48 µl PEI, 50 µl 1× PBS, 120 ng base editor expression or control EGFP expression (pLV-eGFP) plasmid, and 40 ng gRNA expression plasmid were mixed and then incubated at room temperature for 15 min before application to each well for transfection. The experiments were performed as three independent replicates.

Genome-wide DNA and RNA off-target assays
HEK293Ta cells were seeded in a collagen-I-coated 6-well plate (Asone) with 2 ml DMEM at a density of ~2 × 105 cells per well. The next day, 3.0 µl of 1 mg ml−1 PEI, 200 µl 1× PBS, 666 ng base editor expression or control EGFP expression (pLV-eGFP) plasmid, and 333 ng EMX1-targeting gRNA plasmid were mixed and then transferred to each well after 15 min of incubation at room temperature. The experiments were performed as two independent replicates.
