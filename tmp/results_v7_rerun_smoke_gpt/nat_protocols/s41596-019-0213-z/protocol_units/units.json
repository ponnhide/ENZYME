      "text": "Generation and differentiation of hPSC aggregates ● Timing ~6 d\nCRITICAL We cultivate hPSCs under feeder-free conditions using E8 medium and on growth\nfactor–reduced Matrigel-coated 6-well plates. Routinely, we passage the cells every 4–5 d using EDTA, as\npreviously described38.\nCRITICAL Proper maintenance of hPSCs is critical to efﬁcient vascular differentiation. Seeding\nc\ndensity and colony size must be closely monitored, and spontaneous background differentiation must be\nkept as low as possible (Fig. 2a).\n1 Wash hPSCs with 0.5 mM EDTA by removing E8 medium and replacing it with 0.6 mL of 0.5 mM\nEDTA per well of a 6-well plate.\n2 Aspirate the EDTA solution, add 0.6 mL of Accutase per well and incubate for 3–5 min at 37 °C.\nClosely monitor cells under the tissue culture microscope until the cells start to round up.\n3 Dissociate the cells from the plate with a P1000 pipette and pipette the cells gently up and down\n(2–3×) to break up aggregates and to generate single cells.\nCRITICAL STEP Do not pipette the cells more than 2–3×, because single hPSCs are sensitive to\nc\nmechanical stress.\n4 Resuspend the cells in 5 mL of aggregation medium using a 5-mL serological pipette and collect the\ncells in a 15-mL Falcon tube.\n5 For cell counting, mix 10 μL of cell suspension and 10 μL of 0.1% Trypan blue solution (included\nwith the counting chamber slides) and pipette 10 μL of the mixture onto a counting chamber slide.\nMix the cell suspension thoroughly before taking the counting aliquot to achieve accurate and\nconsistent cell number measurements.\n6 Count viable cells using an automated cell counter or under a microscope.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n7 Calculate the cell suspension volume needed for the experiment (2 × 105 cells per well).\nCRITICAL STEP The cell number required for aggregate formation varies by hPSC line. For cell\nc\nlines that are poor at forming aggregates, the cell number must be adjusted to between 5 × 105 and\n1 × 106 cells per well.\n8 Centrifuge the cells at 300g for 5 min (22–23 °C) and aspirate the medium.\n9 Resuspend the cells in fresh aggregation medium (3 mL per well) containing 50 μM Y-27632.\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n10 Place 3 mL of cell suspension per well into a 6-well low-attachment plate and incubate for 1 d until\ncell aggregates with smooth borders (>50- to 100-µm diameter) have been formed (Fig. 2b).\nCRITICAL STEP Efﬁcient aggregate formation is absolutely essential for the success of the\nc\nprotocol. Aggregation capacity varies between hPSC lines, and thus the incubation time may need\nto be adjusted from 1 d to 2 or even 3 d.\n11 One day after aggregates have formed (d0), transfer the aggregates to a 15-mL Falcon tube with a\n10-mL serological pipette and wait for the aggregates to settle down by gravitation. Do not discard\nthe 6-well plate; save it for later aggregate replating.\nCRITICAL STEP Gentle treatment of aggregates is important. Always collect aggregates by\nc\ngravitation. Centrifugation of cell aggregates is not recommended at any point in the protocol.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n12 After cell aggregates have collected at the bottom of the 15-mL Falcon tube (this may take\n15–20 min), carefully aspirate the medium.\n13 Use a 10-mL serological pipette to gently resuspend the aggregates (3 mL per well) in N2B27\nmedium + 12 µM CHIR99021 + 30 ng/mL BMP-4 and transfer the aggregates back to the\nlow-attachment plate. Incubate the cells.\n14 Use a P1000 pipette to quickly resuspend the aggregates once per day to avoid excessive fusion of\naggregates. Incubate for 3 d to induce mesodermal differentiation.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n15 On day 3, transfer the aggregates to a 15-mL tube and wait for them to settle down by gravitation.\nDo not discard the 6-well plate; save it for later aggregate replating.\n16 After cell aggregates have collected at the bottom of the 15-mL Falcon tube, carefully aspirate the\nmedium.\n17 Resuspend the aggregates (3 mL per well) in N2B27 medium + 100 ng/mL VEGF-A + 2 µM\nforskolin and transfer the aggregates back to the low-attachment plates. Incubate for 2 more\ndays (Fig. 2c).\n\nGeneration of blood vessel networks and organoids ● Timing ~9 d\n18 Calculate the number of wells of a 12-well plate needed for aggregate embedding. We embed one\nfull 6-well plate of aggregates in one entire 12-well plate. This usually corresponds to 40–60\naggregates per well.\nCRITICAL STEP The density of aggregates per well is important. Too dense seeding will lead to\nc\nexcessive fusion of blood vessel networks, which makes the analysis and proceeding further with the\nprotocol difﬁcult. By contrast, too sparse seeding will result in inefﬁcient vascular network\nformation.\n19 Calculate the total amount of collagen I–Matrigel solution needed. We use 1 mL per well (in total;\n0.5 mL per well for layer 1 + 0.5 mL per well for layer 2, e.g., one entire 12-well plate will require\n12 mL of collagen I–Matrigel solution: 6 mL for layer 1 (4.5 mL of collagen I solution + 1.5 mL of\nMatrigel) + 6 mL (4.5 mL of collagen I solution + 1.5 mL of Matrigel) for layer 2).\n20 Thaw the required Matrigel aliquots on ice.\n21 Pipette the collagen I solution as described above. Carefully mix by pipetting up and down after\nadding PureCol.\n22 Pipette the exact amount of collagen I solution into a fresh 15-mL Falcon tube and place it on ice.\n23 Add Matrigel to collagen I solution and mix thoroughly by carefully pipetting up and down.\n24 Add 0.5 mL of collagen I/Matrigel solution per 12-well plate and swirl the plate equally to distribute\nthe solution in the wells.\n25 Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 2 h for solidiﬁcation.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n26 Pipette the aggregates into 15-mL tubes with a 10-mL serological pipette. Collect aggregates by\ngravitation.\n27 Wash the aggregates by aspirating the supernatant and adding 1 mL of StemPro-34 SFM complete\nmedium. Repeat the wash once.\n28 Use a P200 pipette to aspirate the medium; remove all remaining medium carefully.\n29 For the second layer, add PureCol to prepare complete collagen I solution.\n30 Prepare the collagen I–Matrigel solution and keep on ice.\n31 Resuspend the aggregates in collagen I–Matrigel solution and keep on ice.\n\n32 Remove the 12-well plate containing the ﬁrst layer of collagen I–Matrigel from the incubator\nand carefully add 0.5 mL of cell aggregate–collagen I–Matrigel solution to each well of the\n12-well plate.\n33 Distribute the aggregates in the wells by rocking the plate back and forth. Once the aggregates are\nwell distributed, slowly move the plate to the incubator.\nCRITICAL STEP The aggregates should be well distributed within the wells to avoid fusion of\nc\naggregates.\nCRITICAL STEP Once the collagen I–Matrigel solution is at room temperature, the polymeriza-\nc\ntion process will start. Do not rock the plate for longer than 30 s–1 min to avoid disturbing the\nsolidiﬁcation process.\n34 Incubate the 12-well plate for 2 h at 37 °C for gel solidiﬁcation.\n35 Add prewarmed (37 °C) StemPro-34 SFM complete medium including 15% FBS, 100 ng/mL\nVEGF-A and 100 ng/mL FGF-2 to induce blood vessel differentiation. Sprouting vessels should\nappear after 1–3 d after embedding.\nCRITICAL STEP The medium must be properly prewarmed to ensure matrix integrity after\nc\naddition of medium.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n36 Change the medium after 3 d and then every other day.\n37 On d10, proceed to the next step to analyze blood vessel networks (using the staining protocol)\nand/or to grow and ﬁx vascular organoid cultures.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nStaining protocols for vascular networks and growth of and staining of blood vessel\norganoids ● Timing 2–3 d\n38 Fix vascular networks (option A) or grow and ﬁx vascular organoids (option B).\n(A) Preparation of vascular networks\nCRITICAL Between 40 and 60 vascular networks can be analyzed from one 12-well culture\nc\nwithout any expected loss of material during the preparation procedure.\n(i) Carefully aspirate the medium from a well using a P1000 pipette and add 4%\nparaformaldehyde (PFA) solution in PBS for 20 min at room temperature.\nCRITICAL STEP PFA fumes will affect cell viability in neighboring wells. If not all the\nc\nwells of the 12-well plate are intended for ﬁxation, use a spatula to carefully lift selected gels\nand use a spoon to transfer the matrix to another 12-well plate for ﬁxation.\n(ii) Remove the PFA solution and add PBS.\nPAUSE POINT Fixed blood vessel networks can be kept in PBS in the refrigerator for up\nj\nto 1 month. Seal the plate with Paraﬁlm to avoid liquid evaporation.\n(iii) To proceed with staining, cut the gels into smaller pieces (1/4–1/2 of a 12-well gel) under a\nstereomicroscope using extra-ﬁne scissors and ﬁne forceps. Avoid cutting through vascular\nnetworks.\n(iv) Use forceps to transfer the gel fragments to a fresh 2-mL Eppendorf tube.\n(B) Establishment of blood vessel organoids and preparation for staining\n(i) For blood vessel organoid cultures, liberate the entire matrix from the well bottom, using the\nround end of a sterile spatula. Move the spatula toward the well center along the\nbottom of the well until the gel is freely ﬂoating.\n(ii) Under sterile conditions, transfer the gel with a sterile lab spoon to the lid of a 10-cm dish\n(Fig. 2j). Cover the lid with the 10-cm plate bottom and proceed to a horizontal laminar\nﬂow station equipped with a stereomicroscope.\n(iii) Use two sterile 30-gauge needles to cut out single blood vessel networks and try to reduce\nthe amount of excessive matrix surrounding the organoids (as shown in Supplementary\nVideo 1). Depending on initial seeding densities, you should expect a full 96-well plate of\norganoids from 2 to 3 wells of a 12-well plate.\n(iv) Transfer single organoids (using a cut P1000 tip) to a 6-well low-attachment plate and add\n5 mL of StemPro-34 SFM complete medium including 15% FBS, 100 ng/mL VEGF-A and\n100 ng/mL FGF-2 and incubate the organoids.\n(v) One day after separating the blood vessel networks (d11), use a cut P1000 tip to transfer\nsingle organoids to low-attachment round-bottom 96-well ultra-low-attachment plates.\nAdd fresh StemPro-34 SFM complete medium including 15% FBS, 100 ng/mL VEGF-A",
