TROUBLESHOOTING\n7 Calculate the cell suspension volume needed for the experiment (2 × 105 cells per well).\nCRITICAL STEP The cell number required for aggregate formation varies by hPSC line.

      "text": "18 Calculate the number of wells of a 12-well plate needed for aggregate embedding. We embed one\nfull 6-well plate of aggregates in one entire 12-well plate. This usually corresponds to 40–60\naggregates per well.\nCRITICAL STEP The density of aggregates per well is important. Too dense seeding will lead to\nexcessive fusion of blood vessel networks, which makes the analysis and proceeding further with the\nprotocol difﬁcult. By contrast, too sparse seeding will result in inefﬁcient vascular network\nformation.\n19 Calculate the total amount of collagen I–Matrigel solution needed. We use 1 mL per well (in total;\n0.5 mL per well for layer 1 + 0.5 mL per well for layer 2, e.g., one entire 12-well plate will require\n12 mL of collagen I–Matrigel solution: 6 mL for layer 1 (4.5 mL of collagen I solution + 1.5 mL of\nMatrigel) + 6 mL (4.5 mL of collagen I solution + 1.5 mL of Matrigel) for layer 2).\n20 Thaw the required Matrigel aliquots on ice.\n21 Pipette the collagen I solution as described above. Carefully mix by pipetting up and down after\nadding PureCol.\n22 Pipette the exact amount of collagen I solution into a fresh 15-mL Falcon tube and place it on ice.\n23 Add Matrigel to collagen I solution and mix thoroughly by carefully pipetting up and down.\n24 Add 0.5 mL of collagen I/Matrigel solution per 12-well plate and swirl the plate equally to distribute\nthe solution in the wells.\n25 Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 2 h for solidiﬁcation.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n26 Pipette the aggregates into 15-mL tubes with a 10-mL serological pipette. Collect aggregates by\ngravitation.\n27 Wash the aggregates by aspirating the supernatant and adding 1 mL of StemPro-34 SFM complete\nmedium. Repeat the wash once.\n28 Use a P200 pipette to aspirate the medium; remove all remaining medium carefully.\n29 For the second layer, add PureCol to prepare complete collagen I solution.\n30 Prepare the collagen I–Matrigel solution and keep on ice.\n31 Resuspend the aggregates in collagen I–Matrigel solution and keep on ice.\n32 Remove the 12-well plate containing the ﬁrst layer of collagen I–Matrigel from the incubator\nand carefully add 0.5 mL of cell aggregate–collagen I–Matrigel solution to each well of the\n12-well plate.\n33 Distribute the aggregates in the wells by rocking the plate back and forth. Once the aggregates are\nwell distributed, slowly move the plate to the incubator.\nCRITICAL STEP The aggregates should be well distributed within the wells to avoid fusion of\naggregates.\nCRITICAL STEP Once the collagen I–Matrigel solution is at room temperature, the polymeriza-\ntion process will start. Do not rock the plate for longer than 30 s–1 min to avoid disturbing the\nsolidiﬁcation process.\n34 Incubate the 12-well plate for 2 h at 37 °C for gel solidiﬁcation.",
