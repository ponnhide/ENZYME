Neural organoids provide models for studying neural regionalization\n through morphogen exposure; however, we lack a comprehensive survey\n of how the developing human neuroepithelium responds to morphogen\n cues. Here we produce a detailed survey of morphogen-induced effects on\n the regional specification of human neural organoids using multiplexed\n single-cell transcriptomic screens. We find that the timing, concentration\n and combination of morphogens strongly influence organoid cell-type and\n regional composition, and that cell line and neural induction method impact\n the response to a given morphogen condition. We apply concentration\n gradients in microfluidic chips or increasing static concentrations in\n multi-well plates and observe different patterning dynamics in each\n scenario. Altogether, we provide a detailed resource on neural lineage\n specification that, in combination with deep learning models, can enable the\n prediction of differentiation outcomes in human stem-cell-based systems.\n\nThe elaborate architecture and functionality of the human central Current knowledge of CNS regionalization mostly originates\nnervous system (CNS) arises from tightly coordinated patterning from studies using non-human animal models with divergent cytoevents initiated in early stages of development.
