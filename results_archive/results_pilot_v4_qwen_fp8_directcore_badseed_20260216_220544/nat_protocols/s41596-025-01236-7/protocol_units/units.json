Each nephron consists of >30 different cell types that are spatially organized\nto perform its diverse kidney functions from glomerular filtration to tubular reabsorption and\nsecretion1–4. Six2+ nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) have a central role in kidney organogenesis:\nthey self-renew and give rise to all the major nephron cell types5. Over the past decade, kidney\norganoids have been developed from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) by recapitulating\nnormal kidney organogenesis6–22. To develop nephron organoids, hPSCs transition sequentially\nthrough mesoderm, intermediate mesoderm and posterior intermediate mesoderm to\ngenerate a transient hPSC-induced NPC (iNPC) population. These transient iNPCs then\nfurther develop into nephron cell types in the organoids. Those pioneering in vitro human\nkidney models have enhanced our understanding of human kidney development and disease\nmechanisms23. Despite the progress, cellular immaturity and the presence of large numbers of\noff-target cell types in hPSC-derived kidney organoids have hindered the development of safe\nand effective kidney-replacement therapies and prevented the accurate modeling of kidney\ndiseases, especially adult-onset diseases23–27. In this protocol, we describe in detail our recently\npublished methodologies for deriving long-term expandable human iNPC lines from hPSCs.\nThese iNPC lines exhibit a stable cell-proliferation rate, retain NPC marker gene expression\nover long-term culture and can be directly used for the generation of nephron organoids,\ndemonstrating minimal off-target cell types with enhanced organoid maturity28 (Fig. 1).\n\nDevelopment of the protocol\nTo track and purify hPSC-derived iNPCs, we first used the CRISPR–Cas9 system to engineer\nhPSCs with a SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry dual reporter system28,29. The protocol to induce transient\niNPCs from hPSCs was optimized from a previously published Morizane protocol7,30 by using\na series of different combinations of growth factors and small molecules at each stage of hPSC\ndifferentiation to mirror the respective signals activated during kidney organogenesis. In the first\nstage to generate a primitive streak from hPSCs, a combination of WNT agonist (CHIR99021) and\nbone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitor (noggin or dorsomorphin) was used in the original\nMorizane protocol. Here, we used a different BMP inhibitor, LDN193189, which is commonly used\n\n\n hPSC thawing hPSC-to-iNPC iNPC line derivation, Generation of\n and passaging differentiation expansion and cryopreservation nephron organoids from iNPCs\n (Steps 1–9, 9 days) (Steps 10–30, 10 days) (Steps 31–52, 5–17* days) (Steps 53–65, 24 days)\n\n\n hPSC hPSC Mixture of hPSC-derived Enriched Expandable iNPC line-derived\n (frozen) (ready-to-use) iNPCs and other cell types iNPCs iNPC line nephron organoid\n\n\n hPSC culture medium: Stepwise differentiation: iNPC culture medium Stepwise differentiation:\n mTeSR Plus Phase I (D0–D4): (hNPSR-v2): Phase I (1 h pulse):\n CHIR99021/LDN193189 FGF2 Heparin CHIR99021\n Phase II (D4–D7): BMP7 Y27632 Phase II (D0-D5):\n Y27632/activin A APEL2/FGF9/heparin\n LIF CHIR99021\n Phase III (D7–D10):\n DAPT LDN193189 Phase III (D5–D21):\n FGF9\n A83-01 SB202190 advanced RPMI1640/B27/A83\n TRULI\n\nFig. 1 | Overview of the protocol.

During stage two to generate posterior intermediate mesoderm\nfrom a primitive streak (D4–D7), we noticed dramatic cell death when following the original\nprotocol, which eventually led to failed differentiation. We found that incorporation of a Rhokinase inhibitor (Y-27632) was able to improve cell survival at this stage, and thus Y-27632 was\nadded in stage two, in addition to activin A from the original protocol. At the third stage of\ndifferentiation from posterior intermediate mesoderm to NPCs, we used 50 ng ml−1 fibroblast\ngrowth factor 9 (FGF9) instead of the original 10 ng ml−1, because this change significantly\nincreased SIX2+/PAX2+ iNPC induction efficiency based on dual reporter expression28. By\nfollowing this optimized hPSC-to-iNPC differentiation protocol, typically 30–50% of the cells will\nbe SIX2+ (10–20% will be SIX2+/PAX2+) based on FACS analysis at the end of stage three28.\n FACS-purified SIX2+/PAX2+ iNPCs were then cultured in a chemically defined human nephron\nprogenitor self-renewal (hNPSR)-v2 medium for expansion28. The hNPSR-v2 medium was\ndeveloped from further optimizing our previously described culture medium that can expand\nprimary mouse NPCs in 3D culture29. The rationale for the development of the NPC culture\ncondition was to mirror the nephrogenic niche environment that promotes the self-renewal\nof the proliferating NPCs in vivo. On the basis of our previously described mNPSR-v1 medium\nrecipe to culture mouse NPCs as 3D aggregates29,31, which include FGF2, which promotes NPC\nsurvival; BMP7 and mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which maintain NPC survival and\nstemness; CHIR99021, which mirrors the WNT11 signal in vivo that is critical for maintaining\nNPC self-renewal; Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor); heparin (FGF co-factor); A83-01 (transforming\ngrowth factor-β signaling inhibitor); and LDN193189 (BMP signaling inhibitor), we further\nscreened culture conditions and developed an mNPSR-v2 medium that allows clonal expansion\nof mouse NPCs in a regular monolayer culture format instead of 3D aggregate culture28. Key\nto the transition from 3D to 2D culture is the use of two additional small molecules, SB202190\n(p38 MAPK inhibitor) and DAPT32 (Notch signaling inhibitor). The CHIR99021 concentration\nwas also adjusted from 1 µM in 3D culture to 1.5 µM in 2D culture. To develop an optimal human\niNPC culture condition, we first replaced mouse LIF in mNPSR-v2 with human LIF to formulate\nhNPSR-v1 medium, because mouse LIF does not activate human LIF receptors. However, human\niNPCs cultured in hNPSR-v1 medium were able to maintain their NPC identity for only 2 weeks\nbefore a gradual decline of cell proliferation activity and key NPC marker gene expression\nwas observed. YAP activity has been reported to have critical roles in NPC self-renewal\nin vivo33. Upon observation of decreased YAP activity in the iNPCs cultured with hNPSR-v1,\nwe supplemented TRULI, a small-molecule YAP agonist34, to hNPSR-v1 medium to formulate\nhNPSR-v2 medium. The hNPSR-v2 medium allows long-term expansion of the iNPCs over several\nmonths with retained NPC marker gene expression and nephrogenic potential28. Importantly,\nthe hNPSR-v2 medium can enrich the transient iNPCs from hPSC differentiation over serial\npassages, even if the iNPCs were not purified by FACS at the beginning of the culture28. This\nfeature allows the derivation of iNPC lines from any hPSC line without prior genome editing to\nknock in the SIX2/PAX2 dual reporter system, greatly broadening the applications.\n Long-term expanded iNPCs in hNPSR-v2 medium retain their developmental potential to\nundergo their nephron fate28. First, the iNPCs are dissociated into single cells and reaggregated\nto form iNPC aggregates in 96-well low-attachment U-bottom plates. The iNPC aggregates are\nthen transferred to Transwell culture at the air–liquid interface, a condition used for decades\nfor mouse kidney explant culture35,36 and for kidney organoid development6–8. To mirror\nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), the initiation step of nephron induction from\nNPCs, CHIR990217,8 is used to mimic the nephron-inducing WNT9b signal from the developing\nureteric bud in vivo37. Upon the initial Wnt signaling activation, iNPCs will differentiate into\nnephron structures within 2–3 weeks. Transitioning from APEL2 basal medium to advanced\nRPMI 1640 medium on day 5 of organoid development can better support the structural\nintegrity of the organoid, especially the maintenance of nephron tubule architecture.\nSupplementation of A83-01 should result in increased organoid maturity, as observed by\nspecific collagen markers in the podocytes and megalin (LRP2) in the proximal tubules28. Thus,\nthese parameters are included in the iNPC-to-nephron organoid differentiation procedures.\nBy following this protocol, major nephron segments are induced within 2 weeks of iNPC\ndifferentiation, with more maturity observed after 3 weeks of differentiation.\n\nNature Protocols 3",

However, in these protocols,\nthese iNPCs are transient and are induced to undergo MET to generate nephron structures\nimmediately after they are formed. Direct reprogramming38 (or trans-differentiation) from\nfibroblasts to nephron progenitor-like cells through the forced expression of NPC-specific\ntranscription factors has also been reported39,40. In addition, culture conditions have been\ndescribed to expand hPSC-derived iNPCs for a short period of time (up to two passages,\nor 14 d)41,42. Compared to these alternative methods to produce nephron progenitor-like\ncells in vitro, the protocol described here can stably expand hPSC-derived iNPCs for several\nmonths with high purity (90–95% SIX2+) and retained nephrogenic potential, allowing scalable\nmanufacturing of high-quality human iNPCs for regenerative medicine and other applications.\nImportantly, transcriptome analysis of the iNPCs cultured in hNPSR-v2 medium indicated better\nresemblance to primary human NPCs in vivo, as compared to the transient iNPCs generated\nfrom hPSC differentiation. Nephron organoids have been generated from hPSCs transitioning\nthrough the transient iNPCs6–22. Compared to these hPSC-derived nephron organoids,\ncultured iNPC-derived nephron organoids show minimal off-target cell types and increased\nnephron maturity, such as the formation of COL4A3+/COL4A4+ mature podocytes28. A recent\npublication20 used an improved iNPC specification step from the standard nephron organoid\nprotocol8 and demonstrated significant enhancement of proximal tubule segmentation and\nmaturity, which is consistent with our observation that NPCs with higher quality will be able to\ngenerate more mature nephrons.\n\nApplication\nThe ability to manufacture near-pure human iNPCs presents an unprecedented opportunity to\nstudy human kidney development, disease and regeneration. We showed in a proof-of-concept\ngenome-wide CRISPR screen in cultured mouse NPCs that candidate genes regulating NPC\nself-renewal can be unbiasedly identified, with implications in congenital kidney disease and\nWilms tumor development28. Similar genome-scale screening or omics approaches can be\napplied to in vitro accessible human iNPCs to understand human NPC biology. We showed that\ngenome editing can be performed directly in iNPC lines, allowing rapid genetic modifications in\niNPCs and assessment of their functional consequences in nephron organoids. As an example,\nwe showed that polycystic kidney disease 2 gene-knockout (PKD2−/−) iNPCs are expandable\nand can reproducibly and highly efficiently generate cystic nephron organoids recapitulating\nthe disease phenotype28. By following a similar approach, other disease-related genetic\nmodifications can be introduced to the iNPC lines to generate novel models of kidney diseases.\nWe also showed that hNPSR-v2 medium was able to reprogram hPSC-derived podocytes or\nprimary podocytes isolated from human fetal kidneys to an NPC-like state, revealing previously\nunknown podocyte plasticity28. This in vitro model offers an opportunity to understand the\ndetailed molecular mechanisms underlying kidney cell plasticity in the future. Compared\nto hPSC-derived nephron organoids, podocytes generated from the iNPC-derived nephron\norganoids show higher expression of mature podocyte marker genes such as COL4A3 and\nCOL4A4, offering a potential tool to model glomerular diseases that cannot be recapitulated\nwith current podocyte models that do not express these genes. However, it is important to\nconsider the following limitations before using this model to study glomerular diseases:\n(i) these iNPC-derived nephron organoids are not vascularized, preventing the modeling\nof glomerular filtration as in a perfused glomerulus in vivo; and (ii) whether specialized\npodocyte structures (e.g., slit diaphragm) are properly formed in this in vitro model remains\nto be determined.\n\nLimitations\nIt is important to note that although cultured iNPCs are similar to primary human NPCs in global\ngene expression and in developmental potential, some differences still exist.

Interestingly,\ndecreased expression of PAX2 appears not to affect iNPC differentiation into nephron organoids\nwhen following this protocol using Transwell culture. This is consistent with a prior observation\nthat PAX2-knockout hPSCs can differentiate into nephron organoids44. PAX8, a paralog of\nPAX2 that shares similar transcriptional activity45, is highly expressed in iNPCs, probably\ncompensating for PAX2 reduction over time. Nevertheless, limitations may exist for using the\niNPC model to study the function of PAX2 in human kidney development and its dysfunction in\nthe development of congenital kidney diseases.\n Compared to standard hPSC-derived nephron organoids7,8 without an NPC purification\nstep, purified iNPC line–derived nephron organoids show dramatically reduced off-target\ncells as expected (0.67% as shown by single-cell multiome analysis28). Interestingly, podocytes\nreproducibly dominate the nephron cell types found in iNPC-derived nephron organoids (on\nthe basis of different batches of experiments, 70–90% are podocytes, while 10–30% are tubules).\nBecause this biased podocyte differentiation is evident in iNPC lines at both early and late\npassages, this phenomenon probably reflects an intrinsic bias from the use of purified iNPCs for\ndifferentiation. Future efforts are warranted to understand the underlying mechanisms and to\nmodify the iNPC differentiation protocol to generate a nephron organoid with the presence of\nbalanced nephron cell types, especially the improvement of nephron tubule formation. Thus,\ncurrent iNPC-derived nephron organoids are not ideal for modeling diseases in which tubules\nare the primary sites of pathology.\n Compared to a complex kidney in vivo, both iNPC-derived nephron organoids and hPSCderived nephron organoids share a few common limitations, such as insufficient nephron\npatterning as seen in vivo (e.g., frequent formation of scattered but not continuous nephron\nsegments and lack of a cortical-medullary axis), immaturity of nephron tubules (e.g., proximal\ntubule cells do not express high levels of transporters essential for kidney functions, such as the\norganic anion/cation transporters, and loop of Henle cells do not express uromodulin/UMOD)\nand the lack of major kidney cell types within the nephron lineage (e.g., SLC12A3+ distal\nconvoluted tubule) and beyond the nephron lineage (collecting duct, stroma, vasculature and\nneuronal systems).\n\nOverview of the procedure\nhPSCs are routinely cultured in mTeSR Plus medium (Steps 1–9) and then differentiated into\niNPCs by using a three-stage protocol in 10 d (Steps 10–30). For hPSC lines that have an NPCspecific reporter (e.g., SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry dual reporter), differentiated iNPCs are purified\nby FACS (Step 31A); for hPSC lines without an NPC-specific reporter, differentiated cells are\ncultured in hNPSR-v2 medium, which will lead to enrichment of the iNPC population over a few\npassages (Step 31B); for hPSC lines without an NPC-specific reporter, in which the differentiated\ncells have a lot of off-target cells, cell surface marker integrin subunit-α 8 (ITGA8) is used to\nenrich iNPCs (Step 31C). The purified or enriched iNPCs can be cultured stably in hNPSR-v2\nmedium for expansion (Steps 32–41) or cryopreserved for long-term storage (Steps 42–44).\nCultured iNPCs should be routinely characterized by immunostaining every four to five\npassages (2–3 weeks) to verify iNPC identity and purity (Steps 45–52). Cultured iNPCs can\ndifferentiate into nephron organoids in a six-well Transwell plate in three phases within 21 d\n(Steps 53–64). The quality of nephron organoid generation can be assessed by immunostaining\nand RT-qPCR (Step 65).\n\nExperimental design\nMaintenance of hPSCs\nThe hPSCs are routinely maintained in feeder-free conditions in commercially available mTeSR\nPlus medium (STEMCELL Technologies). Routine testing for mycoplasma is performed, and\nhPSCs are discarded if they test positive.

Each stage medium is tailored to capture\neach developmental stage that sequentially gives rise to iNPCs. The stage I medium initiates\nhPSC differentiation to the late primitive streak stage. The stage II medium then specifies the\nposterior intermediate mesoderm from the primitive streak. Finally, the stage III medium is to\nenrich the NPC populations in the presence of a high concentration of FGF9. On the last day of\nthe differentiation, the differentiating cells are dissociated to single cells for FACS to purify/\nenrich iNPCs. We use a dual reporter of SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry to collect the iNPC population\nwith high expression of GFP and mCherry, as well as other lines with SIX2-GFP so that sorting can\nbe done by using the specific marker of SIX2. For hPSC lines that do not have the NPC-specific\nreporter system, differentiated cells containing iNPCs can be cultured without FACS in the\nhNPSR-v2 medium. Continuous culture in hNPSR-v2 medium will enrich the iNPC population\nover two to three passages, reaching ~90% SIX2 positivity by immunostaining. Alternatively, if\nthere are large populations of off-target cell types after hPSC-iNPC differentiation, FACS can be\nused to sort for ITGA8 to further purify.\n\nExpansion of iNPCs with hNPSR-v2 medium and cryopreservation of iNPCs\nOnce the hPSC-derived iNPCs have been purified via FACS, they are immediately cultured\nin hNPSR-v2 medium. Within 2–3 d, these iNPCs form clusters in culture as observed for the\nculture of primary human NPCs. Transcriptomes of the iNPCs cultured in hNPSR-v2 medium\nare similar to primary NPCs28. hNPSR-v2 medium is refreshed every 1–2 d. Once the iNPCs\nreach a confluency of 80–90%, they are dissociated into single cells with Accumax and\npassaged at a 1:10 split ratio on Matrigel (Cultrex)-coated plates. Efficient freeze and thaw\ncan be achieved for cultured iNPCs with commercially available freezing medium Bambanker.\niNPC lines can also be derived without prior FACS purification, which relies on hNPSR-v2\nmedium to enrich the iNPC population over serial passages. These iNPC lines share similar\nproperties with the FACS-purified iNPC lines described above and can also be passaged and\ncryopreserved.\n\nGeneration of nephron organoids from iNPCs\nThe expandable iNPCs can be used for nephron organoid formation. Once the iNPCs have\nreached a confluency of 80–90%, they are dissociated into single cells and reaggregated\nat 30,000 cells per aggregate to form iNPC aggregates overnight in 96-well U-bottom lowattachment plates. iNPC aggregates are then gently transferred to a six-well Transwell plate\nfor air–liquid interface culture. The aggregates are treated with 6 µM CHIR99021 for 1 h\n(phase I medium), which mimics the natural epithelization signal in vivo. For the first 5 d,\nthe aggregates are cultured in phase II medium containing FGF9. Starting from day 5, the\nresulting organoids will undergo clear morphological changes that probably reflect the\ninitial nephrogenesis stages transitioning through renal vesicle (RV), comma-shaped body\nand S-shaped body (SSB). On day 5, culture medium is switched to phase III medium, which\nsupports the maturation of nephron cell types until day 21. At the day of harvest, the organoids\ncan be prepared for various assays such as whole-mount staining, RNA and protein extraction\nfor multi-omics analysis and/or assays to determine physiological functions. We usually\nuse iNPC lines that are cultured for ≤2 months, but iNPC lines cultured for 100 d can still\ndifferentiate into nephron organoids28.\n\nNature Protocols 6",

All stock aliquots can be used for the preparation of 100 ml of complete\nhNPSR-v2 medium, except for 10 mM A83-01 stock (first stock), which needs to be further\ndiluted by mixing 1µl of 10 mM A83-01 with 199 μl of DMEM/F12 medium to make a 50 μM\nA83-01 stock solution (second stock). The thawed stock medium components have different\nshelf-lives. For growth factors, it is best to store them at 4 °C and use them within 2 weeks. For\nsmall molecules, including the second stock of A83-01, they are good for ≤1 month at 4 °C.\nThe complete hNPSR-v2 medium can be stored at 4 °C for 2 weeks.\n\n10% (vol/vol) FBS medium\n10% (vol/vol) FBS medium is used for neutralizing the Accumax dissociation reaction during\niNPC passaging.
