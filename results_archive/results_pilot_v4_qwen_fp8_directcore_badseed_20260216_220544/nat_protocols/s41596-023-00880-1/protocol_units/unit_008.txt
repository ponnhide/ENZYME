Reagent setup
Blocking buffer
To make 10 mL of blocking buffer for immunofluorescence staining, dissolve 1 mL of donkey
serum and 10 µL of Triton-X-100 in 8.99 mL of PBS. Store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.

BMP7 (100 µg/mL stock)
Resuspend lyophilized BMP7 (10 µg) in 100 µL of 0.1% human serum albumin containing 4 mM
HCl to make a stock solution of 100 µg/mL. Dispense as 5 µL aliquots into microcentrifuge tubes
and store at −80 °C for up to 6 months.

CHIR99021 (10 mM stock)
Centrifuge the tube of CHIR99021 at 1,000–3,000g for 10 s at room temperature (15–25 °C)
before opening, then reconstitute 10 mg of CHIR99021 in 2.149 mL of DMSO. Aliquot into
microcentrifuge tubes and store at −20 °C for up to 12 months.

CDBLY2
Referring to Table 3, calculate the total volume of CDBLY2 required for the experiment and for
each of the five medium changes (daily from D8 to D12 of differentiation), allowing 1 mL per well
of a 12-well plate and an additional 0.5–1 mL medium for pipetting errors. Collect and thaw all
required reagents detailed in Table 3 on ice. Working on ice in a biological safety cabinet, make
up the total volume of CDBLY2 medium required for the entire experiment in a 50 mL Falcon
tube, adding the exact volume of each reagent to cold media. Invert the tube to mix, then aliquot
into five individual conical tubes for each medium change and refrigerate. Before each medium
change, warm the tube to room temperature. See Troubleshooting section.
