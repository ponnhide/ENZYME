Fig. 3 | Live confocal images of PT functionality assays for protein uptake (imaged using transmitted light). The bottom images depict the absence of
and organic cation transport. a, The images depict the uptake of TRITC– DAPI within organoid nephrons pretreated with the cation transporter inhibitor
albumin (red) into the nephrons (imaged using transmitted light/brightfield) cimetidine. The dead cells in top and bottom images are identified by DRAQ7
of a representative PT-enhanced organoid. Scale bar, 200 µm. b, Uptake of the staining (red). Scale bars, 100 µm.
