Post-translational modiﬁcation\n (PTM) signaling networks control cellular phenotypes and are frequently dysregulated in diseases such as cancer.\n Although signaling networks vary across cell types, there are limited techniques to study cell type–speciﬁc PTMs in\n heterocellular organoids. Here, we present a multiplexed mass cytometry (MC) protocol for single-cell analysis of PTM\n signaling and cell states in organoids and organoids co-cultured with ﬁbroblasts and leukocytes. We describe how thiol-\n reactive organoid barcoding in situ (TOBis) enables 35-plex and 126-plex single-cell comparison of organoid cultures and\n provide a cytometry by time of ﬂight (CyTOF) signaling analysis pipeline (CyGNAL) for computing cell type–speciﬁc PTM\n signaling networks. The TOBis MC protocol takes ~3 d from organoid ﬁxation to data acquisition and can generate single-\n cell data for >40 antibodies from millions of cells across 126 organoid cultures in a single MC run.\n1234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;\n\n\n Introduction\n Organoids are self-organizing biomimetic 3D structures comprising both stem and differentiated\n cells1. Organoids recapitulate many core features of tissue biology and are empowering scientists to\n study both healthy and diseased tissues in vitro2. Healthy organoid models of the intestine3, liver4,\n brain5 and pancreas6 have been developed, as well as patient-derived organoids (PDOs) as avatars of\n personalized cancer therapy7–9. Although incredibly powerful, organoids are heterogeneous model\n systems that are challenging to analyze by using conventional technologies.\n Cells within an organoid can be classiﬁed with a ‘cell type’ (e.g., stem and differentiated) and a ‘cell\n state’ (e.g., proliferating and quiescent)—with cell type often relating to cell state. For example, stem\n cells in small intestinal organoids are often in S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle, whereas terminally\n differentiated enterocytes are post-mitotic or apoptotic10. Biological processes within all cells are\n regulated by protein post-translational modiﬁcation (PTM) signaling networks11. Common PTMs\n include protein phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination12. PTM signaling net-\n works are frequently dysregulated in cancer, and PTM signaling nodes such as kinases are targeted by\n many anti-cancer drugs13. Because PTM signaling networks are cell type–14 and cell state–speciﬁc15,\n heterocellular organoids contain several cell type– and cell state–speciﬁc PTM networks simulta-\n neously (Fig. 1). Experimental manipulation of organoid cultures such as drug treatments and\n CRISPR-mediated genome edits can further alter the cell types, cell states and PTM signaling net-\n works in organoids. Unfortunately, low-dimensional technologies commonly applied to organoids\n cannot measure such high-dimensional changes and therefore fail to capture the complexity of\n organoid biology16. To fully use organoids in biomedical research, we must be able to quantify and\n compare multiple organoid PTM signaling networks in a cell type– and cell state–speciﬁc manner.\n We recently described a mass cytometry (MC) (also known as cytometry by time-of-ﬂight\n (CyTOF)) method to perform cell type–speciﬁc PTM network analysis of organoids and organoid co-\n cultures17. Through the use of heavy metal–tagged probes and antibodies, MC enables >40 protein-\n level measurements at single-cell resolution across millions of cells18. When combined with a thiol-\n reactive organoid barcoding in situ (TOBis) strategy, this method enabled cell type– and cell\n state–speciﬁc comparison of 28-node PTM networks between 20 different organoid cultures in a\n single experiment17. TOBis MC revealed an intimate relationship between cell type, cell state and\n PTM signaling in small intestinal organoids and uncovered a novel connection between oncogenic\n\n\n 1\n Cell Communication Lab, Department of Oncology, University College London Cancer Institute, London, UK. 2Department of Chemistry, University of\n Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 3These authors contributed equally: Jahangir Suﬁ, Xiao Qin. ✉e-mail: c.tape@ucl.ac.uk\n\n NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | OCTOBER 2021 | 4897–4918 | www.nature.com/nprot 4897\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n\n Cell types\n Cell state\n\n Stem M\n Paneth G2\n Cell-cycle\n Transit amplifying S\n phases\n Enteroendocrine G1\n Tuft G0\n Goblet Apoptosis\n Enterocyte Dead\n\n\n PTM signaling\n networks\n\n Low High Weak Strong\n\n PTM nodes PTM-PTM edges\n\n Fig. 1 | Organoids are high-dimensional systems. Schematic of a small intestinal organoid. Small intestinal organoids\n contain multiple cell types, each in a unique cell state.

High-dimensional technologies are needed to simultaneously quantify\n cell type– and cell state–speciﬁc PTM signaling in organoids.\n\n and microenvironmental signaling cues in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor microenvironment orga-\n noid co-cultures17.\n\n\n Overview of the procedure\n Here, we provide a detailed step-by-step protocol to perform TOBis MC analysis of organoids and\n organoid co-cultures (Fig. 2). The TOBis MC protocol comprises four stages: (i) organoid culture and\n pretreatment (Steps 1–7), (ii) organoid in situ barcoding with TOBis (Steps 8–10), (iii) organoid\n single-cell dissociation followed by metal-antibody staining and MC data acquisition (Steps 11–49)\n and (iv) demultiplexing of TOBis-barcoded experimental conditions and downstream data analysis\n (Steps 50–70). The protocol was originally established to study cell type–speciﬁc PTM signaling in\n murine heterocellular organoids by using a 20-plex TOBis barcoding strategy (via a 6-choose-3\n combination, i.e., 3 isotopes ‘on’ and 3 isotopes ‘off’)17. We have since adapted the method to work\n with smaller 96-well plate organoid cultures, expanded TOBis MC to higher-throughput 35-plex\n (7-choose-3) and 126-plex (9-choose-4) formats, demonstrated that the protocol is compatible with\n human PDOs and developed CyGNAL (CyTOF signaling analysis), a computational pipeline for\n analyzing high-dimensional PTM signaling MC data.\n\n\n Comparison with other methods\n Immunoﬂuorescent technologies are limited by the spectral overlap of reporters, susceptible to\n autoﬂuorescent artefacts and inherently low dimensional.

Live organoids are treated with 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (identifying S-phase cells) and phosphatase and\nprotease inhibitors (Procedure Steps 1–3). Organoids are then ﬁxed in situ with paraformaldehyde and stained with 194cisplatin (194Cisp) to identify\ndead/dying cells (Steps 4–7). Organoids from different experimental conditions are barcoded with TOBis reagents while still in Matrigel (Fig. 3),\nwashed with reduced glutathione (GSH) and pooled (Steps 8–10). Organoids are dissociated into single cells by using dispase II, collagenase IV and\nDNase I and stained with extracellular cell-type rare earth metal-conjugated antibodies (Abs) (Steps 11–24). Cells are then permeabilized with Triton\nand methanol, stained with intracellular PTM, cell-state and cell-type Abs (Steps 25–33). Abs are cross-linked to their antigens by using formaldehyde\n(FA), and cells are incubated with 191/193Iridium (Ir) DNA intercalators (Steps 34–37). Single cells are analyzed by using a mass cytometer (Steps\n38–49). Different experimental conditions are debarcoded and preprocessed, and single-cell organoid data are visualized by using uniform manifold\napproximation and projection (UMAP) (Steps 50–60). Cell type–speciﬁc PTM node intensity is calculated by using earth mover’s distance (EMD)\nbetween reference (R) and variable (V) populations, and PTM-PTM connectivity is calculated by using density resampled estimation of mutual\ninformation (DREMI) (Steps 61–70). CSB, cell staining buffer (see Reagents); m/z, mass-to-charge ratio; TOF-MS, time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer.\n\n can be expanded through multiple cycles of staining and quenching19, but this is challenging to\n implement on heterogeneous and delicate 3D organoid cultures. Although ﬂuorescent ﬂow cytometry\n parameters can be increased by using compensation strategies, these workﬂows are complex and not\n well suited to the dozens of intracellular measurements required for routine multiplexed PTM net-\n work analysis20. In contrast to ﬂuorescent technologies, the Dalton-level mass resolution of MC\n instruments21 enables >40 extracellular, intracellular and nuclear monoisotopic heavy metal channels\n to be measured at the single-cell level18.\n High-throughput drug and CRISPR organoid screens rely on bulk viability measurements such as\n CellTitre-Glo7,9. Such assays cannot provide cell type–speciﬁc readouts from co-cultures, lack detailed\n cell-state proﬁling and provide no mechanistic insight into organoid phenotypes. Moreover, bulk\n -omics and low-dimensional ﬂuorescent technologies also struggle to provide multiplexed cell\n type–speciﬁc PTM signaling data from organoid co-cultures. In contrast, TOBis MC provides cell\n type–speciﬁc cell-state quantiﬁcation and PTM signaling networks for every cell in an organoid\n culture. The high-parameter capacity of MC is particularly suited to analyzing PTM signaling in\n organoids co-cultured with stromal ﬁbroblasts and leukocytes17.\n High-dimensional phenotyping of heterocellular systems is commonly performed by using single-\n cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)22,23. Although a mature technology to identify transcriptionally regulated\n differentiation trajectories, scRNA-seq workﬂows to measure intracellular proteins, PTMs and bio-\n chemical processes24 are in their infancy. New scRNA-seq methods using intracellular oligo-tagged\n antibodies have been reported25,26, but such methods have not yet been applied to organoids. In\n comparison, TOBis MC is explicitly designed for highly multiplexed protein and PTM measurements.\n Moreover, because viable cells are needed to achieve suitable read depth and reliable data inter-\n pretation for scRNA-seq, dead cells are usually removed during scRNA-seq sample preparation, and\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | OCTOBER 2021 | 4897–4918 | www.nature.com/nprot 4899\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n stressed cells are excluded in data analysis. Common scRNA-seq workﬂows are therefore heavily\n biased toward healthy cells and not well suited to analyzing cell death in organoids (as might be\n common in a PDO drug screen7). By contrast, MC can analyze viable, stressed and dead cells and is\n therefore capable of assessing apoptotic mechanisms in perturbed organoid cultures.\n Cell states and PTM signaling are dynamic processes that are rapidly altered by single-cell dis-\n sociation27,28. Therefore, organoids should be ﬁxed before dissociation to accurately preserve cell\n states and labile PTM signals for molecular analysis. Unfortunately, most scRNA-seq methods are\n incompatible with paraformaldehyde (PFA)-ﬁxed cells23. In contrast, MC is fully compatible with\n PFA ﬁxation and can accurately measure cell states and PTMs from PFA-ﬁxed organoids. Although\n droplet-based scRNA-seq methods have greatly improved cell throughput29,30, leading commercial\n platforms (such as 10x Genomics) are commonly limited to ~1–10 × 103 cells per run. Given that a\n typical 12-well plate organoid culture contains ~0.5–1 × 106 cells per well, droplet-based scRNA-seq\n methods can capture only ~0.1–1% of the cells in such an experiment. In comparison, TOBis MC\n routinely analyzes >1 × 106 single cells and can therefore provide a more holistic view of organoid\n cultures. Once the protocol is established, data generation is also very rapid. We typically go from\n ﬁxed organoid cultures to single-cell PTM data in ~3–4 d. Finally, by barcoding organoids very early\n in the protocol, TOBis reduces technical variation between samples in downstream steps (e.g.,\n antibody staining) and increases single-cell recovery17.\n\n Limitations\n Because TOBis MC requires organoids to be dissociated into a single-cell suspension, all spatial\n information is lost. Methods such as imaging mass cytometry31, multiplexed ion beam imaging31 or\n in situ scRNA-seq32 should be considered when high-dimensional spatial phenotyping is required.\n Although MC can in theory be used to measure any cell sample that can be dissociated into single\n cells, we have not optimized TOBis for tissue samples. We recommend methods speciﬁcally opti-\n mized for ﬁxed tissue such as DISSECT28 for measuring PTM signaling in tissue. MC cannot describe\n intercellular signaling mediated by the thousands of ligand–receptor interactions responsible\n for transducing signals between cells. We suggest using scRNA-seq ligand–receptor analysis such\n as CellPhoneDB33,34, NicheNet35 or CellChat36 to study intercellular communication in organoid\n co-cultures.\n Although we have expanded the capacity of TOBis multiplexing to up to 126 different organoid\n cultures, this is still far below the thousands of conditions assessed in high-throughput screening\n applications7. We therefore still recommend bulk viability measurements when mono-culture assay\n throughput is paramount.\n Like all immunostaining methods, MC is heavily dependent on high-quality antibody reagents.\n Although many PTM and cell-state antibodies are well validated for MC, organoid cell-type iden-\n tiﬁcation antibodies are typically less established. Users are advised to screen and validate cell-type\n identiﬁcation antibodies when applying this protocol to novel organoid cultures. Like most MC\n experiments, the cost of TOBis MC is dominated (75–80%) by the price of metal-conjugated\n antibodies (Supplementary Table 1).\n\n Applications\n We have successfully applied TOBis multiplexing to 6-well, 12-well, 48-well and 96-well organoid\n culture formats to study cell type–speciﬁc PTM signaling networks in organoids and organoids co-\n cultured with stromal and immune cells17. The protocol is also well suited to studying how organoid\n signaling networks can be regulated by stromal and immune cells, including cellular therapies such as\n chimeric antigen receptor T cells (C.J.T. and Callum Nattress, University College London Cancer\n Institute, unpublished observations, 2021). We have successfully applied TOBis MC to multiple\n genotypic and microenvironmental conditions17. Although the workﬂow was developed by using\n murine intestinal organoids, the protocol is compatible with human PDO drug and perturbation\n screens7 where mechanisms of cell death and insight into drug resistance are of interest.\n\n Experimental design\n Organoid culture\n This protocol is designed to measure cell type–speciﬁc PTM signaling networks in organoids cultured\n in a protein-rich extracellular matrix such as Matrigel. Organoids can be grown in 6-well (×7 40-µl\n droplets), 12-well (×3 30-µl droplets), 48-well (×1 30-µl droplet) and 96-well (×1 50-µl stack) culture\n\n4900 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | OCTOBER 2021 | 4897–4918 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n a b Organoid culture 1 Organoid culture 126\n 122 TOBis 1 TOBis 126\n Te\n 123\n O Te Barcode\n 124 Ma Ma Ma Cl\n Te organoids 122 124 128 196\n TeMal N 125 35-plex TOBis in situ\n Te 123 125 130 198\n NH (7-choose-3) Ma Ma Ma Cl\n 126\n O Te Te\n 128\n Barcodes\n\n\n O Te\n 130\n Te S S S S S S\n S\n Thiol Quench S\n Metal S Ma Ma Ma Cl\n reactive unbound 122 124 128 196 S\n 126-plex TOBis barcodes S S\n S\n S\n (9-choose-4) S\n 123 125\n Ma\n 130 198\n Cl S\n Ma Ma\n\n Cl NH3 128\n 196\n Pt 124\n Cisplatin Pt Pooled Ma\n Ma\n 198\n Pt 130 196\n Cl NH3 single-cell 122 a\n M\n 125 Cl\n Ma\n Ma\n dissociation 19\n 123 a Cl 8\n M\n Thiol\n Single-cell mass cytometry\n Wash\n\n\n SH\n Glutathione O O H O\n\n\n Intensity\n\n\n Intensity\n N Debarcode\n HO N OH\n NH2 H O organoid cells\n m/z m/z\n\n\n 122\n 123\n 124\n 125\n 126\n 128\n 130\n 196\n 198\n\n\n 122\n 123\n 124\n 125\n 126\n 128\n 130\n 196\n 198\n c 35-plex TOBis d 126-plex TOBis\n (7-choose-3) (9-choose-4)\n 122\n 123\n 124\n 125\n 126\n 128\n 130\n\n\n 122\n 123\n 124\n 125\n 126\n 128\n 130\n\n\n 122\n 123\n 124\n 125\n 126\n 128\n 130\n 196\n 198\n\n\n 122\n 123\n 124\n 125\n 126\n 128\n 130\n 196\n 198\n\n\n 122\n 123\n 124\n 125\n 126\n 128\n 130\n 196\n 198\n\n\n 122\n 123\n 124\n 125\n 126\n 128\n 130\n 196\n 198\n 1 19 1 33 65 97\n 2 20 2 34 66 98\n 3 21 3 35 67 99\n 4 22 4 36 68 100\n 5 23 5 37 69 101\n 6 24 6 38 70 102\n 7 25 7 39 71 103\n 8 26 8 40 72 104\n 9 27 9 41 73 105\n 10 28 10 42 74 106\n 11 29 11 43 75 107\n 12 30 12 44 76 108\n 13 31 13 45 77 109\n 14 32 14 46 78 110\n 15 33 15 47 79 111\n 16 34 16 48 80 112\n 17 35 17 49 81 113\n 18 18 50 82 114\n 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\n 19 51 83 115\n 20 52 84 116\n Median intensity\n 3\n (×10 )\n 21 53 85 117\n 22 54 86 118\n 23 55 87 119\n 24 56 88 120\n Barcode ‘off’ Barcode ‘on’ 25 57 89 121\n 26 58 90 122\n Frequency\n\n\n Frequency\n\n\n 27 59 91 123\n 28 60 92 124\n 29 61 93 125\n 30 62 94 126\n 31 63 95 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1\n Barcode Barcode 32 64 96\n intensity intensity Median intensity\n 3\n (×10 )\n\n\nFig. 3 | TOBis multiplexing overview. a, TOBis reagents.

The heatmap shows numbers of organoids (pan-cytokeratin (PanCK)+ and CEACAM1+), ﬁbroblasts\n(podoplanin (PDPN)+ and RFP+) and macrophages (CD68+ and F4/80+) recovered from each TOBis barcode. TOBis MC speciﬁcally resolved all the\nconditions and successfully labeled all the cell types within the culture. b, UMAP projections of single cells from representative debarcoded TOBis\nconditions, demonstrating the compatibility of TOBis to organoid co-cultures.\n\n\n endpoint, culture medium is removed and replaced with 4% (wt/vol) PFA and incubated at 37 °C for\n 60 min. Fixed organoids are then washed with PBS and stained with monoisotopic cisplatin (e.g.,\n 194\n cisplatin or 198cisplatin) for 10–15 min (Supplementary Fig. 2). Cisplatin enters cells with com-\n promised membranes faster than cells with intact membranes and can therefore be used to identify\n dead and dying cells in organoid cultures42.\n\n TOBis multiplexing\n Mass-tagged cellular barcoding is used in MC experiments to increase sample throughput, reduce\n technical variation and decrease rare earth metal-conjugated antibody usage43,44. Unfortunately,\n commercial palladium mass-tagged cellular barcoding reagents (commonly used for barcoding leu-\n kocytes in suspension) are not suitable for labeling organoids while embedded in Matrigel17. To\n overcome this, we developed TOBis based on monoisotopic tellurium maleimide (TeMal)45 and\n cisplatin46 that can label organoids while still in Matrigel17 (Fig. 3a,b). We originally reported a 20-\n plex doublet-ﬁltering barcoding matrix based on 124Te, 126Te, 128Te, 130Te, 196Pt and 198Pt (using a 6-\n choose-3 combination strategy, i.e., 3 isotopes ‘on’ and 3 isotopes ‘off’)17. Through the addition of\n 122\n Te, 123Te and 125Te TeMals, we have now expanded TOBis to support 35-plex (7-choose-3)\n (Fig. 3c) or 126-plex (9-choose-4) multiplexing (Fig. 3d).\n We premix TeMals and cisplatins into TOBis barcodes either by hand or by using an Opentrons\n OT-2 robot (https://github.com/TAPE-Lab/OT-2-Automated-Barcode-Pipetting) and store as ready-\n to-use kits. We typically use 35-plex TOBis for day-to-day experiments and reserve 126-plex bar-\n coding for screening applications. On the day of the experiment, the TOBis barcodes are added to\n organoid cultures and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following day, unbound thiol-reactive\n barcodes are quenched by using reduced glutathione and washed from the cultures (Fig. 3b). These\n quenching and washing steps avoid unbound barcodes cross-reacting with off-target organoid cells\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | OCTOBER 2021 | 4897–4918 | www.nature.com/nprot 4903\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n when all cultures are subsequently pooled17. When used as described in this protocol, TOBis\n achieved a barcoding accuracy of >99% (Fig. 4) and can be used to stain up to 2 million cells per well\n of a 96-well plate culture (Supplementary Fig. 3). TOBis can be used to multiplex mouse or human\n organoids and organoids co-cultured with other cell types in 3D, such as stromal ﬁbroblasts and\n leukocytes (Fig. 5).\n\n\n Organoid single-cell dissociation and rare earth metal-conjugated antibody staining\n After TOBis staining, each organoid culture is removed from Matrigel and resuspended in a dis-\n sociation buffer containing dispase II, collagenase IV and DNase I. During optimization, we found\n that dispase II breaks cell–cell contacts, collagenase IV digests Matrigel components and DNase I\n degrades genomic DNA released from dead cells commonly found in organoid cultures. Dissociation\n enzymes affect cell recovery and antibody staining and should be optimized carefully for each\n biological system and antibody panel (Supplementary Fig. 4). TOBis barcoded organoids from each\n condition are pooled into a single master tube and then dissociated into single cells by using a\n gentleMACS Octo dissociator. After dissociation, single organoid cells are washed and ﬁltered to\n remove clumps. Cells are then stained for extracellular epitopes with rare earth metal-labeled anti-\n bodies (hereafter referred to as metal antibodies). Preconjugated metal antibodies can be purchased\n via Fluidigm or custom conjugated by using established protocols47. Cells are then permeabilized by\n using 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 50% (vol/vol) methanol or both. Permeabilization buffers can\n greatly alter antibody staining and should be optimized for each biological system and antibody panel\n (Supplementary Fig. 5). Once permeabilized, cells are stained with a panel of metal antibodies against\n intracellular proteins and PTMs. Cells are then washed, and antibodies are cross-linked to their\n epitopes by using 1.6% (wt/vol) formaldehyde (FA). Finally, cells are incubated in DNA intercalator\n 191/193\n Ir overnight before MC single-cell data acquisition and analysis.\n\n\n MC single-cell data acquisition\n Stained organoid cells are washed into water containing 2 mM EDTA, diluted to 0.8–1.2 × 106 cells/\n ml and spiked with isotopic EQ beads48. Cells are then loaded into a Super Sampler (Victorian\n Airships), and single-cell data are acquired by using a mass cytometer (e.g., Fluidigm Helios). During\n optimization, we found that adding 2 mM EDTA to the running buffer and using the Super Sampler\n greatly improve the acquisition of epithelial organoid cells by MC (J.S. and X.Q., unpublished\n observation, 2018).\n\n\n TOBis MC single-cell data analysis\n After data acquisition, raw MC data are normalized48 and exported as standard FCS ﬁle(s). Multi-\n plexed TOBis experiments are debarcoded44 (https://github.com/zunderlab/single-cell-debarcoder)\n into individual conditions (Fig. 6a), imported into Cytobank (http://www.cytobank.org/) or an\n equivalent cytometry data analysis platform (e.g., FlowJo) and gated with Gaussian parameters to\n remove debris, DNA/cisplatin to identify live cells and cell-type markers to remove doublets (Fig. 6b).\n The fully gated datasets containing cells of interest are further processed with our MC data analysis\n pipeline, CyGNAL (https://github.com/TAPE-Lab/CyGNAL)49 (Supplementary Fig. 6). The com-\n ponents of CyGNAL were previously used to analyze the datasets described by Qin et al.17. In brief,\n the preprocessing step formats and exports the heavy metal channels (based on the naming con-\n vention of the Fluidigm CyTOF software), embeds the metadata of the experiment and assigns each\n event within the dataset a unique cell index. Dimensionality reduction (e.g., uniform manifold\n approximation and projection (UMAP)50) can be performed on cell-comprised datasets and is mainly\n used as a visualization tool in our workﬂow (Fig. 6c). Cells can be assigned a cell-type identity via\n biaxial gating (Fig. 6d), followed by cell-state identiﬁcation and PTM analysis in a cell type–speciﬁc\n manner (Fig. 6e,f). Earth mover’s distance (EMD)51,52 is used to quantify PTM node intensity, and\n density resampled estimation of mutual information (DREMI)53 is used to score PTM-PTM edge\n connectivity. Multiple EMD/DREMI values can be visualized with heatmaps and further summarized\n by using principal component analysis (PCA). When paired with a well-curated antibody panel and\n robust experimental design, TOBis MC allows multiplexed analysis of cell type–speciﬁc PTM sig-\n naling of heterocellular organoids17.\n\n\n4904 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | OCTOBER 2021 | 4897–4918 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n a Debarcode multiplexed TOBis MC co-culture data\n d Cell type\n\n\n Event 1 Organoids\n TOBis_1.fcs\n\n\n CEACAM1\n m/z m/z\n TOBis_n_Org.fcs\n Raw.fcs Event 2 TOBis_2.fcs\n m/z m/z\n PanCK\n\n Event n TOBis_35.fcs Fibroblasts\n m/z m/z\n\n\n PDPN\n TOBis_n_Cells.fcs\n TOBis_n_Cells.fcs\n TOBis_n_Pro.fcs TOBis_n_Fib.fcs\n b\n Single-cell preprocessing\n\n Debris removal Live-cell gate Doublet removal RFP\n 9,133\n 94.6% 87.4% 98.3% RFP Macrophages\n Event length\n\n\n 1,174\n\n\n F4/80\n Pan-CK\n TOBis_n_Mac.fcs\n Ir\n\n\n 151\n 193\n\n\n 19.11\n\n 0 CD68\n Center 191 CD68\n Ir\n 3,430 e Cell state\n 97.3% 97.8% 99.7% CD68\n 563.5\n Pan-CK\n Width\n\n\n Ir\n\n\n 92.53 TOBis_n_Org.fcs\n 193\n\n\n S\n\n\n IdU\n 14.8\n Cell type\n –specific\n pRB [S807/S811]\n 0\n Center 194\n Pt RFP cell state\n 1,592\n 98.1% 98.0% Pan-CK Pan-CK M 1%\n 316.9\n G2 40%\n CD68\n Width\n\n\n pHH3 [S28]\n 62.99\n M\n 12.06\n Pan-CK S 17%\n cCaspase 3 [D175]\n\n\n 0\n Residual RFP Apoptosis G1 18%\n\n Pan-CK G0 18%\n Ap. 6%\n TOBis_n_Cells.fcs\n TOBis_n_Cells.fcs Embed TOBis_n_Cells.fcs\n TOBis_n_Cells.fcs G0 G2\n TOBis_n_Cells.fcs TOBis_n_Pro.fcs\n Cyclin B1\n\n\n metadata\n + Pan-CK G1\n Filter Assign Panel_markers.csv\n channels cell index\n Pan-CK\n\n c UMAP visualization f PTM signaling networks\n\n\n TOBis_n_Cells.fcs\n Cell-type-specific PTM network\n TOBis_n_Cells.fcs\n TOBis_n_Pro.fcs UMAP TOBis_n_Org.fcs EGFR TGF-βR E-cadherin FZD LRP LGR ZNRF BMPR\n UMAP2\n\n\n S465 S467 T310 S9 S33 S37 T41 S463 S465\n GRB2 SMAD2/3 p120-Catenin GSK-3β β-Catenin SMAD1/5/9\n\n\n Y418 S241 T172\n\n\n Arcsinh transform RAS SRC PI3K PDPK1 LKB1 AMPKα\n\n\n Arcsinh Filter S257 Y705 T308 S473\n\n transform markers MEKK MKK4 STAT3 AKT AKT MTORC2\n\n\n UMAP1 Filter markers\n S189\n\n MKK3/6\n S207 S221\n\n MEK1/2\n T497\n\n PKCα MTORC1 MTORC1\n S235\n\n S6\n S236\n\n\n T180 Y182 T202 Y204 S112 T37 T46 S235 S236 T37 T46\n\n p38 MAPK ERK1/2 BAD 4E-BP1 S6 4E-BP1\n\n\n T334 T359 Y551 S529\n\n MAPKAPK2 p90RSK SYK BTK1 IKKα/β/γ NF-KB p65\n\n\n EMD DREMI S133\n\n CREB CDK2/4\n S807\n\n RB\n S811 S28\n\n Histone H3 Caspase-9\n D175\n\n Caspase-3\n\n\n (nodes) (edges)\n <–1.6 EMD >1.6 <0.1 DREMI >1.2\n\n Down-regulated Up-regulated Weak Strong\n PCA Heatmap in cell type in cell type connection connection\n\n\nFig. 6 | TOBis MC data analysis using CyGNAL. a, TOBis MC raw data are debarcoded44 into individual experimental conditions (TOBis_n.fcs). b, All\ndebarcoded data ﬁles are imported into a cytometry data analysis platform for debris removal, live-cell identiﬁcation and doublet removal (percentages\nshown are of the parent population), yielding cells for analysis (TOBis_n_Cells.fcs).

We advise users to develop custom metal-conjugated antibody panels spe-\n ciﬁcally for their biological questions and titrate their panels (using 1 µg of antibody/ml of CSB as a\n starting point) with prior knowledge such as antigen abundance and heavy metal monoisotopic\n impurities55,56. In our experience, cell state (e.g., proliferating, quiescent and apoptosis) has a con-\n siderable inﬂuence on PTM signaling17. We therefore strongly advise users to include cell cycle\n (e.g., pRB (S807/S811), cyclin B1, geminin, PLK1 and pHistone H3 (S28))15,41,57 and apoptosis\n (e.g., cCaspase3 (D175) and cPARP (D214)) markers in their panels. Particular care should be taken\n to validate cell-type identiﬁcation antibodies that have not previously been used in MC. Ideally more\n than two cell-type identiﬁcation antibodies should be used per cell type. An example metal antibody\n panel for studying murine small intestinal organoid cells is provided in Supplementary Table 2.\n\n TOBis\n Debarcoding efﬁciency is heavily dependent on robust signal intensities of the Te and Pt channels.\n Because barcode signal intensities can vary between isotopologues, barcode batch and cell types being\n labeled, we advise titrating TeMal and cisplatin barcodes to achieve an ‘on’ median intensity >5 × 102\n and an ‘off’ median intensity <1 × 102 in desired cell types (Fig. 3c,d). We use TeMals at\n 122\n Te = 2.2 µM, 123Te = 2.0 µM, 124Te = 1.8 µM, 125Te = 1.5 µM, 126Te = 1.5 µM, 128Te = 1.1 µM\n and 130Te = 0.96 µM and both cisplatins at 196Pt and 198Pt = 125 nM (diluted in PBS). These\n concentrations offset the differential mass-range sensitivity of MC instruments and the alternative\n thiol-reactive functional groups of TeMal (maleimide) and cisplatin (chloride).\n In practice, we prepare TOBis barcodes either by hand or robot (see below) and divide them into\n aliquots as ready-to-use kits (stored in 96-well PCR plates). TeMals and cisplatins can be mixed at\n desired concentrations according to the barcoding matrix (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) manually\n or by using a liquid-handling robot. Scripts to prepare both 35-plex (7-choose-3) and 126-plex\n (9-choose-4) TOBis barcodes by using the OT-2 platform (Opentrons) are provided at https://github.\n com/TAPE-Lab/OT-2-Automated-Barcode-Pipetting. Premixed TOBis barcodes can be kept at\n −80 °C for long-term storage before use.

This\n c\n\n\n protocol describes how to analyze intestinal organoids grown either in monoculture or co-cultured with\n intestinal ﬁbroblasts and/or primary bone marrow–derived macrophages in a 96-well plate. Users are\n advised to deploy their own optimized organoid culture conditions as inputs for TOBis MC.\n\n4908 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | OCTOBER 2021 | 4897–4918 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n Culture organoids\n 1 Culture organoids (or organoid co-cultures) in 50 µl of Matrigel and 200 µl of medium in a\n standard 96-well tissue culture plate.\n CRITICAL STEP For the results illustrated in this paper, we have cultured murine intestinal organoids\n\n\n c\n (Fig. 3), human CRC PDOs (Fig. 4) and murine organoids co-cultured with colonic ﬁbroblasts and/or\n macrophages (Fig. 5) for 3 d in 50 µl of Matrigel and 200 µl of medium. Users should use optimized\n culture conditions relevant to their own organoids and biological questions as inputs for TOBis MC.\n\n S phase cell labeling ● Timing ~30 min\n 2 Add 127IdU directly to culture medium to a ﬁnal concentration of 25 µM (10 µl of 0.5 mM stock\n added to 200 µl of medium). Gently rotate the plate by hand ﬁve times for 10 s to mix the medium\n and incubate the plate for 25 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n CRITICAL STEP 127IdU incubation enables identiﬁcation of S phase cells.\n c\n\n\n Phosphatase and protease inhibitor treatment ● Timing ~5 min\n 3 Add the protease inhibitor cocktail (100× stock; see Reagents) and PhosSTOP (40× stock; see\n Reagents) directly to culture medium, gently rotate the plate by hand ﬁve times for 10 s and\n incubate for 5 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n CRITICAL STEP Protease and phosphatase inhibitors have been shown to help preserve cell\n c\n\n\n signaling and antigen stability during ﬁxation28. However, because prolonged treatment may\n introduce technical artefacts, we advise users to empirically determine the duration of the treatment\n according to their experimental system and antibody panel (Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\n Fixation ● Timing ~80 min\n 4 Remove culture medium by pipetting. Add 200 µl of prewarmed (37 °C) 4% (vol/vol) PFA into each\n well, taking care not to disrupt Matrigel. Incubate for 60 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n CRITICAL STEP PFA ﬁxation in situ ensures that labile cell-state and PTM proﬁles are preserved\n c\n\n\n during the downstream sample handling.\n CRITICAL STEP Matrigel can dissolve in cold PFA. It is therefore important to prewarm PFA to 37 °C.\n c c\n\n\n CRITICAL STEP Some antibodies are sensitive to ﬁxation. PFA concentrations ranging from 1.6%\n to 4% were proved to be functional, but we encourage users to determine the optimal concentration\n of PFA for their speciﬁc antibody panel.\n ? TROUBLESHOOTING\n 5 Remove PFA solution by pipetting, taking care not to disturb the Matrigel. Wash the cells with PBS\n on a rocker (speed set at ~45 rpm throughout the protocol) for 10 min at room temperature\n (~20 °C). Repeat the wash.\n PAUSE POINT Fixed cells can be kept at 4 °C in PBS. We advise users to determine the maximal\n j\n\n\n storage time with their speciﬁc culture systems.\n\n Live/dead discrimination ● Timing ~30 min\n 6 Remove PBS by pipetting. Add 200 µl of 0.25 µM 194cisplatin/PBS solution to each well and\n incubate for 10–15 min on a rocker at room temperature.\n CRITICAL STEP Because dead cells can be found inside organoid structures (Fig. 1), it is crucial that\n c\n\n\n organoids be stained for long enough that all cells have the opportunity to bind cisplatin. However,\n organoids can also be easily overstained with cisplatin; it is therefore important that cultures are stained\n for the same duration of time and that this step does not exceed 20 min (Supplementary Fig. 2).\n 7 Remove the 194cisplatin solution by pipetting. Wash cells with PBS on a rocker for 10 min at room\n temperature. Repeat the wash.\n CRITICAL STEP Proceed to the next steps on the same day. Long-term storage of cisplatin-\n c\n\n\n stained cells in situ will lead to cisplatin overstain that confounds live/dead cell discrimination.\n CRITICAL STEP If barcoding multiple organoid samples, continue to Step 8. If only one organoid\n c\n\n\n culture condition is being analyzed, skip to Step 11.\n\n TOBis (optional) ● Timing ~30 min of bench work; incubation overnight\n 8 Transfer 200 µl of pre-aliquoted TOBis barcodes to corresponding organoid samples in a 96-well\n plate (from Step 7). Any barcode combination can be used to stain any culture condition\n (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Incubate the cells overnight at 4 °C.\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | OCTOBER 2021 | 4897–4918 | www.nature.com/nprot 4909\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n CRITICAL STEP Record the sample barcode assignments. Different samples labeled with the same\n\n\n c\n TOBis barcode should not be pooled together.\n CRITICAL STEP Ensure that correct amounts of TOBis barcode are added to each well for\n\n\n c\n successful debarcoding.\n CRITICAL STEP TOBis barcodes should not be used to stain >1 million cells per well of a 96-well\n\n\n c\n culture (Supplementary Fig. 3). In practice, culturing >1 million cells per well of a 96-well plate is\n uncommon. The users are advised to count cells at seeding if high-density cultures are needed.\n 9 Remove the barcoding solutions by pipetting and wash the cells with 200 µl of 2 mM glutathione/\n CSB for 10 min on a rocker at room temperature. Repeat the wash twice.\n CRITICAL STEP Reduced glutathione quenches unused thiol-reactive TOBis barcodes, thereby\n c\n enabling efﬁcient discrimination of ‘on’ and ‘off’ signals for sample demultiplexing.\n 10 Wash the cells with 200 µl of PBS for 10 min on a rocker at room temperature. Repeat the wash.\n PAUSE POINT The barcoded cells can be kept at 4 °C for ≤4 weeks in PBS.\n j\n\n\n Single-cell dissociation ● Timing ~90 min\n 11 Make up a dissociation solution of fresh 0.5 mg/ml dispase II, 0.2 mg/ml collagenase IV and 0.2 mg/\n ml DNase I in PBS at room temperature.\n CRITICAL STEP Dissociation enzymes can affect cell recovery and antibody performance\n c\n\n\n (Supplementary Fig. 4). We encourage users to test and titrate alternative dissociation enzymes for\n the speciﬁc cellular composition of their experimental system.\n CRITICAL STEP Using freshly prepared enzyme solutions ensures optimal and reproducible\n c\n\n\n enzyme activity.\n 12 Remove PBS from the wells by pipetting and add the dissociation solution.\n 13 Scrape Matrigel droplets and pool all cells from all conditions with dissociation solution to a\n gentleMACS C-Tube. Top up the dissociation solution to 5 ml/C-Tube.\n CRITICAL STEP Do not overload the gentleMACS C-Tubes. We encourage users to empirically\n c\n\n\n determine how much dissociation buffer is needed on the basis of the density of their organoid\n cultures and the number of conditions. If multiple C-Tubes are needed, the user should pool all\n barcoded cells before splitting them evenly into each C-Tube to minimize technical variation.\n CRITICAL STEP Fibroblasts and leukocytes can migrate out of the central Matrigel droplet and\n c\n\n\n adhere to the plastic bottom of the culture plates in prolonged co-cultures. Scrape each well\n thoroughly to ensure that all cells are recovered.\n 14 Dissociate organoids into single cells by using a gentleMACS Octo dissociator and the ‘Standard\n protocol’ (see Equipment setup) (Timing: ~50 min).\n CRITICAL STEP On completion of the program, the user needs to conﬁrm visually that the\n c\n\n\n dissociation is sufﬁcient; i.e., very few cell clumps should be visible at this stage. If not, users are\n encouraged to perform an additional round of the ‘Quick protocol’ (see Equipment setup) on the\n gentleMACS Octo dissociator.\n ? TROUBLESHOOTING\n 15 After sufﬁcient dissociation, centrifuge the C-Tubes at 800g for 1 min at room temperature to\n collect the cells.\n 16 Transfer all cells and solution to a polypropylene FACS tube.\n CRITICAL STEP Organoid cells often pellet better in polypropylene than polystyrene FACS tubes.\n c\n\n\n 17 Centrifuge cells at 800g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.\n 18 Wash cells with 2 ml of CSB, centrifuge at 800g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the\n supernatant. Repeat the wash.\n 19 Resuspend cells in 2 ml of CSB and ﬁlter through a cell strainer to get rid of residual cell clumps.\n CRITICAL STEP We use 35-µm cell strainers to ﬁlter organoid monocultures and 70-µm cell\n c\n\n\n strainers for cultures containing large cells such as ﬁbroblasts. Users should choose appropriate cell\n strainers on the basis of the cellular composition of their experimental system.\n 20 Count cells by using the Countess II automated cell counter. Up to ~4.5 × 106 cells can be taken\n forward for 1× MC staining.\n PAUSE POINT The ﬁxed, barcoded and dissociated cells can be kept at 4 °C for ≤4 weeks in CSB.\n j\n\n\n ?

Although we commonly use 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 followed by 50%\n (vol/vol) methanol, we advise users to optimize the permeabilization conditions that best suit their\n model system and antibody panel.\n 29 Add 2 ml of CSB to the cells, centrifuge at 800g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the\n supernatant.

Users are advised\n\n\n c\n to check every experimental condition to ensure that all cell types of interest are included in the\n DNA gating step.\n CRITICAL STEP The cisplatinhigh population contains both dead and dying cells. If cell death is of\n\n\n c\n biological interest (e.g., in a drug-screening assay), we suggest users be more lenient with the\n cisplatin gating to include dying cells.\n 56 Perform cell-type gating to exclude doublets (i.e., cells positive for mutually exclusive cell-type\n markers) (Fig. 6b).\n 57 Export the dataset as FCS ﬁles and proceed to data analysis with CyGNAL.\n CRITICAL STEP The dataset now contains events that are identiﬁed as single cells (Fig. 6b,\n c\n TOBis_n_Cells.fcs).\n 58 To preprocess dataset(s) by using CyGNAL, copy the cell-comprised FCS ﬁle(s) to the Raw_Data\n folder within the pipeline folder, run python code/1-data_preprocess.py and follow the\n prompts. This step will generate two outputs: the preprocessed datasets and the ﬁle\n panel_markers.csv containing all the markers used in the experiment. The output ﬁles are\n saved in a folder named by the user-deﬁned analysis identiﬁer within the Preprocessed_Data folder\n (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 6).\n CRITICAL STEP Preprocessing of dataset(s) by 1-data_preprocess.py is prerequisite for the\n c\n\n\n subsequent analysis steps and has to be performed as the ﬁrst step of the workﬂow.\n CRITICAL STEP panel_markers.csv is used by downstream scripts to specify the markers of\n c\n\n\n interest in a given analysis.\n CRITICAL STEP The input ﬁle formats supported by CyGNAL are standard FCS and tab-\n c\n\n\n separated ASCII TXT. Users can choose to save the output as either TXT or FCS ﬁle(s) (stripped of\n original FCS metadata), with the default set to match the input ﬁle format (example ﬁles can be\n accessed at the GitHub repository).\n\n Dimensionality reduction (UMAP) ● Timing 20–40 min (~1 million cells)\n 59 Copy CyGNAL-processed dataset(s) and the corresponding panel_markers.csv to the Analysis/\n UMAP_input/ folder and edit panel_markers.csv by labeling markers used for UMAP calculation\n with ‘Y’ (by default, all markers are labeled with ‘N’).\n 60 Run python code/2-umap.py from the pipeline folder and follow the prompts. The original\n dataset updated with UMAP coordinates will be formatted as TXT ﬁle(s) and saved in a folder\n named by the user-deﬁned analysis identiﬁer in Analysis/UMAP_output/ (Fig. 6c and\n Supplementary Fig. 6).\n CRITICAL STEP When performing UMAP analysis on multiple conditions within the same\n c\n\n\n experiment, the 2-umap.py script will concatenate all the input ﬁles, calculate UMAP coordinates\n for the concatenated dataset and save the results as separate conditions on the basis of their ﬁle of\n origin. This ensures that all the input ﬁles share a common UMAP embedding to facilitate direct\n comparison between conditions.\n CRITICAL STEP When multiple ﬁles are used for UMAP analysis, users can down-sample all\n c\n\n\n input ﬁles to the cell count of the sample with the lowest cell number (details on which cells are\n included for the analysis can be found in the output folder). This yields a more balanced dataset for\n UMAP calculation and visualization and reduces memory requirements and computation time.\n\n Cell-type and cell-state identiﬁcation ● Timing ~45 min\n 61 Import CyGNAL-processed dataset(s) to Cytobank or an equivalent FCS processing\n software (e.g., FlowJo).\n 62 Identify different cell types present in the experimental condition(s) on the basis of cell\n type–speciﬁc markers (Fig. 6d).\n CRITICAL STEP To improve the ﬁdelity of cell-type identiﬁcation, at least two markers should be\n c\n\n\n used per cell type. Ectopically expressed cell type–speciﬁc ﬂuorescent proteins such as GFP and RFP\n are useful for cell-type identiﬁcation when robust endogenous antigens are unavailable.\n 63 For each identiﬁed cell type, perform cell-state analysis based on cell-state markers (Fig. 6e).\n 64 Export the cell type– and/or cell state–speciﬁc dataset(s) as FCS or TXT ﬁles for PTM signaling\n network analysis.\n CRITICAL STEP If using Cytobank, uncheck ‘Include header with FCS ﬁlename’ when exporting\n c\n\n\n TXT ﬁles and make sure that the dataset(s) is exported as raw values (Cytobank gives users the\n option to export illustration-based transformed data).\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | OCTOBER 2021 | 4897–4918 | www.nature.com/nprot 4913\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n PTM signaling network analysis ● Timing 20–40 min (dependent on the scale of the\n experiment)\n 65 Copy CyGNAL-processed, cell type–speciﬁc dataset(s) and the corresponding panel_markers.csv to\n Analysis/EMD_input/ or Analysis/DREMI_input/ and edit panel_markers.csv by labeling markers\n used for the calculation with ‘Y’ (by default, all markers are labeled with ‘N’).\n 66 Run python code/3-emd.py or python code/4-dremi.py and follow the prompts. The\n output will be saved in folders named by the user-deﬁned analysis identiﬁer within Analysis/\n EMD_output/ or Analysis/EMD_output/ accordingly. EMD and DREMI scores can be visualized\n by using heatmaps (Steps 67 and 68) or summarized with PCA (Steps 69 and 70).\n CRITICAL STEP For EMD calculations, the user needs to deﬁne the reference (R) dataset for all\n c\n experimental variables (V) against which to compare. By default, the concatenation of all input ﬁles\n is used as R, but users can also assign a speciﬁc dataset as the reference.\n CRITICAL STEP The choice of R can greatly inﬂuence the interpretation of EMD scores. When\n c\n\n\n there is a clear baseline control in a given experiment (e.g., untreated monoculture), that control\n population should be used as R. However, when there is no obvious baseline condition (e.g., when\n comparing PTMs between different cell types within organoids), we advise using a concatenated\n population of all conditions as R (default setting).\n CRITICAL STEP EMD is a non-negative metric quantifying the difference between two\n c\n\n\n distributions. In our workﬂow, EMD scores are signed by the difference of a marker’s median\n intensity between V and R to indicate the ‘direction’ of signaling change—positive for up-regulation\n and negative for down-regulation.\n CRITICAL STEP For DREMI calculations, users can perform standard deviation–based outlier\n c\n\n\n removal or generate conditional probability plots for each marker combination. Note: these\n optional settings increase computational load.\n\n\n Heatmap visualization ● Timing <5 min\n 67 To visualize EMD/DREMI scores by using heatmaps, copy the output of EMD/DREMI calculations\n to the Analysis/Vis_Heatmap folder.\n 68 Open a terminal from the pipeline folder, run python code/5v1-heatmap.py and perform\n interactive heatmap visualization in the prompted browser window. Once a satisfactory layout has\n been achieved, the heatmaps can be exported as a PNG image or PDF document.\n\n\n PCA ● Timing <5 min\n 69 To perform PCA, copy the output of EMD/DREMI calculations to the Analysis/Vis_PCA folder.\n 70 Run python code/5v2-pca.py and perform interactive heatmap visualization in the\n prompted browser window. Once a satisfactory layout has been achieved, the heatmaps can be\n exported as a PNG image or PDF document. The PCA coordinates with the percentage of variance\n explained by each principal component can be exported separately as a TXT ﬁle.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nTroubleshooting advice can be found in Table 1.\n\n Table 1 | Troubleshooting table\n\n Step Problem Possible reason Solution\n\n 4 Matrigel droplets dissolve in PFA The PFA solution is not warm enough Prewarm 4% (vol/vol) PFA solution to 37 °C before\n the ﬁxation step.
