 Human organoids are emerging as a valuable resource to investigate human organ development and disease. The
 applicability of human organoids has been limited, partly due to the oversimpliﬁed architecture of the current technology,
 which generates single-tissue organoids that lack inter-organ structural connections. Thus, engineering organoid systems
 that incorporate connectivity between neighboring organs is a critical unmet challenge in an evolving organoid ﬁeld. Here,
 we describe a protocol for the continuous patterning of hepatic, biliary and pancreatic (HBP) structures from a 3D culture
 of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). After differentiating PSCs into anterior and posterior gut spheroids, the two
 spheroids are fused together in one well. Subsequently, self-patterning of multi-organ (i.e., HBP) domains occurs within
 the boundary region of the two spheroids, even in the absence of any extrinsic factors. Long-term culture of HBP
 structures induces differentiation of the domains into segregated organs complete with developmentally relevant

 unique platform for studying human development, congenital disorders, drug development and therapeutic transplanta-
 tion. More broadly, our approach could potentially be used to establish inter-organ connectivity models for other organ
 systems derived from stem cell cultures.


 Introduction
 Failure to establish contiguous organ architectures because of developmental defects, infection or
 drug toxicity leads to critical and, in most cases, lethal organ failures, as seen in biliary atresia,
 tracheoesophageal ﬁstula and congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract. Animal models
 have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms for generating connections between tissues.
 However, because of profound differences in both metabolism and molecular regulation between
 animals and humans, translation of these ﬁndings from animal models into human biology and
 disease remains a major challenge1.
 Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids are increasingly recognized as cutting-
 edge in vitro model systems for investigating human organ development and diseases, with the
 potential to also supplant fetal tissue research2–8. However, the applicability of hPSC-derived orga-
 noids has been limited thus far, partly because technology has been limited to the generation of
 single-tissue organoids lacking inter-organ structural connections. It is vital to understand the
 mechanisms that drive the intricate inter-organ orchestrations that occur during organogenesis,
 which can then be leveraged for developing appropriate multi-organ 3-D stem cell culture systems
 that allow for seamless connections to neighboring tissues9–11.
 Here, we describe a 3D differentiation approach using hPSCs to grow gut spheroids with distinct
 regional identities, which are comprised of both endoderm and mesoderm populations. We
 demonstrate that the anterior and posterior spheroid interactions recapitulate the in vivo foregut and
 midgut boundary. These interactions generate an organoid composed of several types of organs,
 called a human hepato-biliary-pancreatic (HBP) organoid (HBPO)12, that can model the inter-
 coordinated speciﬁcation and invagination that naturally occur in development. Although this system
 has limitations, such as requiring further reﬁnement of the later stages of HBP organogenesis

 (increased tissue maturation would be required for transplant applications), this HBPO system
 enables modeling of complex multi-organ development and disease in vitro.

 Development of the protocol
 In early embryogenesis, the foregut endoderm ﬁrst arises at the early- to mid-primitive streak stages,
 leading to the formation of the deﬁnitive endoderm. This endodermal sheet begins to fold in at the
 anterior and posterior ends, forming the anterior and caudal intestinal portals, respectively, during
 early somitogenesis13. During anterior intestinal portal formation and subsequent foregut tubulo-
 genesis, a medial part of the foregut endoderm sheet is roughly deﬁned in the dorsal walls of the
 primitive gut tubes, and the lateral foregut endoderm cells are relocated into the ventral midline of the
 gut tube closure14. During foregut closure, the liver, gallbladder, and ventral pancreas primordia are
 speciﬁed within adjacent regions of the ventral foregut endoderm.
 The formation of each individual primordium is induced and maintained by distinct signaling
 factors released from neighboring tissues15,16. In the posterior foregut, mesodermal cues instigate
 localized proliferation and/or migration of the endoderm, which results in budding of the liver, and
 dorsal and ventral pancreas by embryonic day 9.5. After embryonic day 9.5, the speciﬁed endodermal
 organ domains of the gut tube undergo morphogenesis and lineage diversiﬁcation to create the
 functional architecture connecting neighboring organs.
 Well-deﬁned temporal expression of certain genes has been localized to distinct regions during
 organogenesis, and this gene expression can be exploited to identify particular areas of the embryo. In
 vivo, the HBP anlage, which is demarcated by HHEX (hematopoietically-expressed homeobox pro-
 tein) and PDX1 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1) expression17, is ﬁrst speciﬁed at the boundary
 region between the foregut and midgut, as indicated by expression of the foregut endoderm marker
 SOX2 (SRY-box2) and the mid/hindgut endoderm marker CDX2 (caudal-type homeobox2),
 respectively. The HBP anlage forms an epithelial vesicle invaginating ventrally from the primitive gut
 as a result of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions18,19. Given that genetic perturbation of such
 boundary-deﬁning genes disrupts integral multi-organ development20, it is clear that continuous,
 dynamic organogenesis occurs in a complex environment and is probably driven by neighboring
 factors (such as boundary interactions)21. From this knowledge, we hypothesized that the recapitu-
 lation of the foregut-midgut boundary in a stem cell culture acts to induce continuous hepatic, biliary
 and pancreatic structures.
 Therefore, to develop a foregut-midgut boundary, we ﬁrst exposed deﬁnitive endoderm, patterned
 as previously described4, to ﬁbroblast growth factor and a WNT signaling agonist, which promote gut
 tube formation and patterning, in the presence or absence of a bone morphogenetic protein
 antagonist, which induces foregut speciﬁcation, to direct SOX2 expressing anterior or CDX2
 expressing posterior gut fate.

 Overview of the procedure
 The overall procedure can be separated into six major stages (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Video 1).
 Stage 1 is PSC culture (Steps 1–19; day −2 to day −1). Stage 2 is deﬁnitive endoderm induction (Steps
 20–29; day 0–day 2). Stage 3 is anterior/posterior gut patterning (Steps 30–33; day 3–day 6) and
 anterior/posterior gut spheroid formation (Steps 34–37; day 7). Stage 4 is anterior-posterior boundary
 formation (Steps 38–41; day 8). Stage 5 is HBPO polarization culture (Steps 42–48; day 9–day 12).
 Stage 6 is long-term HBPO growth culture (Steps 49–55; day 13 onward).

 Applications
 Studying mechanisms by which inter-tissue connections are generated in humans remains a major
 challenge because of limited access to fetal samples and poor manipulability22. Although signaling
 mechanisms for organ speciﬁcation have been studied in animal models, the ways in which com-
 binatorial endoderm-mesoderm interactions orchestrate inter-connected and multi-organ patterning
 in humans remain elusive. Human HBPOs can serve as an in-a-dish model to investigate and
 interrogate the complex inter-organ segregation process. For example, we have shown that the
 transient and localized suppression of retinoic acid signaling at the foregut-midgut border is crucial
 for directing HBP patterning in hPSC-derived organoids12. Interestingly, in agreement with animal
 studies, the accompanying mesenchyme probably plays an important role in lineage speciﬁcation into
 HBP precursors. Therefore, this system provides a novel platform that will facilitate future
 mechanistic studies about contributions of different cell types in organogenesis. Our integrated

 multi-organ model system can be used as a tractable, manipulatable and readily achievable model to
 broaden our knowledge of complex organogenesis and disease mechanisms in humans.
 For example, our HBPOs could be useful for mechanistic studies of biliary atresia and evaluation
 of therapeutic responses to new potential treatments. Biliary atresia, a disease of inter-organ con-
 nectivity failure, is the most common indication for pediatric liver transplantation worldwide.
 Persistent inﬂammation and obstruction in the bile ducts lead to abnormal accumulation of bile and
 consequently signiﬁcant liver damage. Several animal model studies of experimental biliary atresia
 have investigated the role of a Notch effector, Hes family bHLH transcription factor 1 (HES1), in the
 initiation and progression of the disease. Deﬁcient Hes1 expression results in induction of experi-
 mental biliary atresia in animals23, with ectopic pancreatic endocrine cell generation probably due to
 the role of HES1 as a general negative regulator of endodermal endocrine differentiation23. We know
 that HES1 expression is evolutionariy conserved in gallbladder primordium and its derivatives in
 humans, but it remains unclear how HES1 activity is involved in the segregation of the HBP pri-
 mordium and subsequent development of the bile duct system. In HBPOs differentiated from PSCs
 with a genetic knock-out of HES1, biliary speciﬁcation is abolished, while pancreatic fate commitment
 is promoted in Hes1-deﬁcient mice12.
 Building inter-organ connections in a dish has been a long-standing challenge because of a limited
 understanding of the developmental processes during organogenesis. Previous studies have also been
 hindered by lack of efﬁcient programming of the cells to naturally segregate and organize in a
 spatiotemporally appropriate manner. Many attempts have been made to either developmentally or
 synthetically solve these issues, including organoid generation, tissue printing, cell-material composite
 formation and decellularization and recellularization of existing 3D tissue. Each of these methods has
 shown some success; however, none has provided a durable, persistently functional system1.

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 Recapitulating boundary interactions in 3D stem cell culture is one potential approach to drive an
 organ segregation program10,24–27. Animal organogenesis studies have revealed that the prospective
 HBP region arises from a boundary between the foregut and midgut. Co-cultivation of stem
 cell–derived foregut and midgut is sufﬁcient to induce a boundary-speciﬁc transcriptional program
 that includes the modulation of WNT and retinoic acid pathways, leading to HBPO generation. Thus,
 in vitro boundary modeling could potentially be used to establish inter-organ connectivity models for
 other organ systems derived from stem cell cultures.

 Experimental design
 Differentiation is achieved through several steps, starting with the 2D generation of anterior and
 posterior gut cells according to previously described methods4,28 with certain key modiﬁcations in
 basal medium and concentration of growth factors. Next, from these 2D cultures, we make single-cell
 suspensions of the anterior and posterior gut cells, and, in the presence of the Rho kinase inhibitor
 Y-27632, spheroids are generated on day 7. The successful generation of stable spheroids is absolutely
 critical to efﬁciently and consistently form HBPOs. Therefore, the size of the aggregates is crucial, and
 careful consideration must be given to both the number of cells used and the incubation time for
 aggregate formation. To generate a boundary organoid, one anterior and one posterior spheroid are
 carefully mixed in Matrigel in a single well, wherein the two spheroids will fuse overnight (Fig. 1).
 For long-term culture, we tested several different culture conditions for the day 13 boundary
 organoids to evaluate HBP organogenesis12. Among the tested culture conditions, we found that
 using the air–liquid interface system of excised PROX1+ domains continued the morphogenesis for
 the longest period, resulting in the formation of a branching structure that we have called HBPO.
 Time-course imaging showed that the dissected PROX1+ domain changed from an epithelial
 morphology to a more convoluted structure after 2 d of culture.

 Alternative methods
 Recently, several groups have described hepato-biliary-like organoids that can be differentiated from
 hPSCs and fetal liver progenitor cells29,30. However, these methods generate liver tissues composed of
 intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes, and do not generate any extrahepatic components
 or surrounding organs. Tissue decellularization and recellularization methods have shown some
 success in creating more spatially deﬁned 3D tissues, but the temporal dynamics that naturally occur
 between organs during biological or pathological processes have not yet been modelled31,32. Our
 system is potentially compatible with emerging organ-on-chip technologies, provided a measurable
 readout can be developed33.

 Limitations
 The early stage of our protocol (up to day 13) can be carried out with high efﬁciency and repro-
 ducibility. However, moving into later stages, morphological variation is observed between experi-
 ments because of variation in the efﬁciency of branching of the pancreas-like tissue. Therefore, the
 dissection of the HBPO region by using a lineage-speciﬁc reporter PSC line is recommended to
 improve the efﬁciency of epithelial bifurcation.
 Our current HBPO system is less mature than adult tissues, and it is not suitable for transplan-
 tation applications. Further HBP organogenesis (e.g., to include the liver budding process, including
 delamination of the hepatic epithelial sheet by disruption of the laminar layer) would potentially
 require the addition of stromal cell components, such as septum transversum mesenchyme and/or
 endothelial progenitors. Nevertheless, the in vitro contiguous speciﬁcation and early morphogenesis
 of HBP subdomains provide an opportunity to investigate the complex interactions at the
 anterior–posterior boundary and the generation of interconnected, multi-organ structures. This
 model can be used to study personalized human organogenesis and model disease systems in vitro,
 with the ultimate goal of developing new therapies for human diseases.

Procedure
 Passage of PSCs (day −2) ● Timing 1–2 h
 1 Pre-coat 24-well plates with GFR Matrigel as described in Reagent setup. The coated plates can be
 wrapped in Paraﬁlm and kept for ≤2 weeks at 4 oC.
 CRITICAL STEP All tissue culture steps in this protocol should take place in a sterile environment
 c


 and be performed with aseptic technique to prevent culture contamination.
 2 Take a six-well plate of undifferentiated PSCs and remove the mTeSR1 by aspiration from the wells
 to be passaged (Fig. 2a).
 3 Wash the wells with 2 ml of sterile DPBS. Aspirate the DPBS.
 4 Add 1 ml of accutase to the wells.
 5 Incubate at 37 oC for 5 min, allowing PSC colonies to dissociate into single cells.
 6 Add 5 ml of warm DMEM/F12 to each well to sufﬁciently dilute the accutase.
 7 Gently triturate each treated well two to three times before transferring the 6 ml of PSCs in medium
 to a conical tube. Repeat the process with the remaining wells until all cells are collected into the
 same conical tube.
 8 Centrifuge the cells at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C.
 9 Aspirate the medium from the conical tube.
 10 Add warm mTeSR1 to the conical tube.
 11 Count the cells.
 12 Aspirate the Matrigel from the prepared Matrigel-coated 24-well plate (from Step 1).
 13 Plate the cells at a density of 100,000–150,000 cells/well in 500 μl of mTeSR1 including 10 μM
 Y-27632 on a Matrigel-coated tissue culture 24-well plate. Prepare cells with at least two
 independent wells to generate anterior and posterior gut spheroids at the same time.
 14 Place the 24-well plate in a tissue culture incubator and ensure that the single cells are evenly
 distributed in the wells by gently moving the 24-well plate side to side.
 15 Incubate overnight in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

 Change mTeSR medium (day −1) ● Timing 0.5 h
 16 Warm mTeSR1 at room temperature (15–25 °C).
 17 Conﬁrm that the plated cells are healthy and are growing at a uniformly high density.
 18 Aspirate old mTeSR1 with 10 μM Y-27632 to change the medium. Add fresh mTeSR1 without
 Y-27632 (Step 16), 500 μl/well for a 24-well plate.
 19 Place the 24-well plate back in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 Differentiation of PSCs into deﬁnitive endoderm (days 0–2)
 Day 0 ● Timing 0.5 h
 20 Check the conﬂuency of the cells by using an inverted microscope. Cells should have reached
 80–90% conﬂuence (Fig. 2b).
 CRITICAL STEP It is imperative that the cell conﬂuence is as close to 80–90% as possible. If the


 c
 cell density is too high or low, this can result in overgrowth of mesoderm, cell death after activin A
 treatment and/or incomplete differentiation. Before beginning differentiation, titrate the cell
 number for each line to ensure 80–90% conﬂuence on day 0. It is possible to wait an additional 24 h
 until this conﬂuency is reached; aspirate the mTeSR1 and add 500 μl of fresh mTeSR1 to each well.
 21 Warm an aliquot of day 0 medium to room temperature.
 c CRITICAL Pre-warming the medium on this day helps to increase cell survival.
 22 Aspirate the mTeSR1 medium. Add 0.5 ml/well of day 0 medium to the 24-well plate. Place the
 plate back in the incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.

 Day 1 ● Timing 0.5 h
 CRITICAL After 1 d of treatment with day 0 medium, there should be evidence of cell death and
 c


 ﬂoating cells in the medium. However, there should still be a layer of cells attached to the plate
 after treatment.
 23 View cells under an inverted microscope to determine if cells are still attached to the tissue culture
 plate (Fig. 2b). If there are few or no cells attached, abandon the protocol and restart.
 24 Aspirate the day 0 medium.
 25 Add 0.5 ml/well of fresh day 1 medium to the 24-well plate.
 26 Place the plate back in the incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.

 Day 2 ● Timing 0.5 h
 CRITICAL After 1 d of treatment with day 1 medium, there should be evidence of cell death and
 c


 ﬂoating cells in the medium. However, there should still be a layer of cells attached to the plate after
 treatment. View cells under an inverted microscope to determine if cells are still attached to the tissue
 culture plate (Fig. 2b). If there are few or no cells attached, abandon the protocol and restart.
 27 Aspirate the day 1 medium.
 28 Add 0.5 ml/well of fresh day 2 medium to the 24-well plate.
 29 Place the plate back in the incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.

 Differentiation of PSCs into anterior/posterior gut cells (days 3–6) ● Timing 0.5–1 h
 every day
 30 (Optional) If anterior or posterior gut cells cannot be differentiated successfully, conﬁrm that PSCs
 are induced to deﬁnitive endoderm on day 3 by immunostaining5. Endoderm markers, such as
 GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), SRY-Box transcription factor 17 (SOX17) and Forkhead box
 A2 (FOXA2), can be used to determine the efﬁciency of the deﬁnitive endoderm differentiation.
 Over 70% of cells should express these markers. An example of optimal results is shown in Fig. 2c.
 31 Each day on days 3–6, warm anterior day 3–6 medium and posterior day 3–6 medium at room
 temperature and then aspirate the media and replace with 500 μl/well of the prewarmed anterior
 day 3–6 medium (for anterior gut cells) and prewarmed posterior day 3–6 medium (for posterior
 gut cells). Owing to the high number of live cells in each well, the phenol red in the medium will
 turn yellow by 24 h. Conﬁrm the presence of 3D structures forming from the monolayer of cells,
 including attached and ﬂoating spheroids (Fig. 2d–f).
 32 (Optional) If anterior or posterior gut spheroids cannot be formed successfully, conﬁrm that PSCs
 are induced to anterior/posterior gut cells by ﬂow cytometry analysis. The epithelial marker
 EpCAM can be used to determine the efﬁciency of the gut differentiation. 60–90% of cells in both
 the anterior and posterior structures should express EpCAM on day 7. An example of optimal
 results is shown in Fig. 2g.

 Anterior/posterior gut spheroid formation (day 7) ● Timing 2–3 h
 33 On day 7, dissociate the anterior or posterior gut cells to single cells by incubation with TrypLE
 Express at 37 °C for 5 min (Fig. 3a).

 Box 1 | Whole-mount staining of HBPOs
 At day 8, SOX2 positive (~80%) anterior and CDX2 positive (~80%) posterior gut spheroids should form. This can be conﬁrmed by whole-mount
 immunostaining, as shown in Fig. 3b. At day 11, PDX1-expressing HBP anlage cells should be observed at the boundary of anterior and posterior gut
 spheroids, as shown in Fig. 3d. HHEX can also be detected at day 11 in the boundary region. In long-term culture conditions, after day 20, PROX1-
 expressing tissue should start to grow (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, you should be able to see a tissue connection between AFP-expressing liver-like
 tissue and PDX1-expressing pancreas-like tissue (Fig. 4d,e).

 Procedure
 1 Remove as much cell culture medium from the cultures as possible, taking care not to disturb the organoids.
 2 Add 500 µl of pre-chilled Cell Recovery solution.
 3 Pipette up and down gently by using wide-bore tips to carefully break up the Matrigel matrix without damaging the organoids and collect the
 organoids into a 15-ml conical tube.
 4 Incubate the cultures with Cell Recovery solution at 4 °C for 20 min.
 5 Centrifuge the cultures at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C, remove the Cell Recovery solution and repeat steps 2–5.
 6 Visualize the organoids under the microscope to conﬁrm that the Matrigel has been fully depolymerased and that organoids are ﬂoating free
 from the Matrigel. If organoids appear free from the Matrigel, centrifuge the cultures at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C to separate the structures
 from the solution. Remove the Cell Recovery solution.
 7 Add 5 ml of cold DPBS to the tube and gently pipette up and down to wash the Matrigel from the organoids.
 8 Spin down the conical tube at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C.
 9 Gently aspirate the DPBS.
10 Wash a second time with 5 ml of DPBS and spin down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C.
 11 After aspirating DPBS, ﬁx the organoids in 1 ml of 4% (wt/vol) PFA at 4 °C overnight.
12 Spin down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min. Remove the PFA solution and dispose of properly.
 13 Treat the ﬁxed samples with 500 µl of 4% (wt/vol) PFA with 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 at room temperature for 15 min.
14 Spin down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min. Remove the PFA/Triton X-100 solution and dispose of properly.
15 Add 5 ml of DPBS to the tube to suspend, and spin down the conical tube at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C.
16 Gently aspirate the DPBS.
17 Wash a second time with 5 ml of DPBS, spin down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C and gently aspirate the DPBS.
18 Add 1 ml of permeabilization buffer (0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20/DPBS) to the tube and transfer the organoids in solution to a 1.5-ml centrifuge
 tube. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature.
19 After gently removing the permeabilization buffer, add 1 ml of blocking buffer (1% (wt/vol) BSA and 0.3% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in DPBS) and
 leave for 1 h at room temperature.
20 Prepare the primary antibody mixture in blocking buffer. Perform a spin-down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C and aspirate off the blocking
 buffer. Add the primary antibody mixture and incubate overnight at 4 oC.
21 Aspirate the primary antibody mixture and perform three washes with 1 ml of DPBS, spinning down and aspirating the DPBS each time.
22 Prepare the secondary antibody mixture in blocking buffer. Add this mixture to the tube with the organoids and leave at room temperature for
 2 h or overnight at 4 oC.
23 Wash three times with 1 ml of DPBS, spinning down and aspirating the PBS each time.
24 Add 50 μl of DPBS to each tube of organoids and transfer to one well of an IBIDI glass slide. Add one drop of DAPI mounting medium per well.
 Gently tilt the slide side to side to mix the DAPI mixture.

 An example of optimal results is shown in Fig. 3b–d.


 HBPO culture (day 9) ● Timing 2–3 h
 41 On day 9, embed A–P spheroids in Matrigel drops and culture in gut growth medium to generate
 multi-organ HBPOs (Fig. 3c). Maintain the spheroid cultures at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2,
 95% air and replace the gut growth medium every 4 d.
 42 Pick up a fused A-P spheroid by using a mechanical pipette with a wide-bore 200-µl tip and place
 the spheroid into a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube.
 43 Spin down and carefully remove the supernatant with a regular sterile ﬁlter pipette tip.
 CRITICAL Organoids may be visible but be difﬁcult to see; a dissecting microscope will help with
 c


 visibility and handling.
 44 Add 20–30 µl/well of 100% Matrigel (Phenol Red–Free) on ice to the fused A-P spheroid in a 1.5-ml
 tube. Gently re-suspend the single A-P spheroid by using a mechanical pipette with a wide-bore
 200-µl tip and slowly plate it on a 24-well tissue culture plate (VWR International) to make a
 Matrigel drop.

 studying the ﬂuorescent activity under the microscope. Using a Pasteur pipette, pick up the
 dissected HBPO.
 50 Transfer the (dissected or undissected) HBPO to a six-well Transwell. Add one HBPO
 per Transwell.
 51 Add 10 µl of fresh pre-chilled 100% Matrigel over the organoid to cover it.
 52 Incubate the organoid in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 3 min.
 53 Carefully add 500 µl–1 ml of gut growth medium to the bottom of the Transwell.

Anticipated results
 The boundary interactions between anterior and posterior gut spheroids that have been differentiated
 from PSCs enable autonomous emergence of HBP organ domains speciﬁed at the foregut-midgut
 boundary in the absence of any added extrinsic factors. Deﬁnitive endoderm differentiation (step 30;
 day 3; Fig. 2b–d)) yields a population of cells over 70% pure by SOX17 and FOXA2 double-positive
 staining (Fig. 2c)4,28,35. During the gut cell induction (Steps 31 and 32; days 3–7), 3D structures
 gradually form in a highly reproducible manner in various lines of PSCs (Fig. 2h). At day 7 (Step 33),
 we separately dissociate anterior gut cells and posterior gut cells to reaggregate them in low-
 attachment 96-well round-bottom plates. At day 8, SOX2 positive (~80%) anterior and CDX2 positive
 (~80%) posterior gut spheroids should form, and this can be conﬁrmed by whole-mount immu-
 nostaining as in Fig. 3b and FACS12. After mixing each gut spheroid in a low-attachment, 96-well
 round-bottom plate, fused spheroids form with a high rate of reproducibility12. At day 9, PDX1 or
 PROX1 expression is not observed; however, during polarization culture in Matrigel, both proteins
 began to be expressed at the boundary domain of the fused spheroids (Fig. 3d). We ﬁnd that
 morphogenesis continues in these PDX1 and PROX1 positive domains, which form a branching
 structure called an HBPO (Fig. 4a,b). The efﬁciency of HBPO production was increased approxi-
 mately two-fold by air–liquid interface culture in our validation study12. Time-course imaging shows
 that the PROX1 positive epithelium in the HBPO starts to invaginate and grow outward in multiple
 directions, progressively forming a branching structure around day 23 (Fig. 4c). Immunoﬂuorescent
 staining with the liver markers alpha fetoprotein (AFP), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A)
 and albumin, the pancreatic marker PDX1 and the bile duct marker DBA conﬁrms that each lineage

 Box 2 | CRISPR editing for HES1-knockout PSC line
 Candidate guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the start codon of HES1 transcript were designed by using online tools
 available at https://www.benchling.com. The sequence of our gRNA is listed in our original article. The candidate
 gRNA oligo was cloned into a pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP vector (Addgene, 48138).

 Procedure
 1 Seed PSCs onto a Matrigel-coated 24-well plate.
 2 The next day, transfect with 2 µg of the vector plasmid into the PSCs by using Lipofectamine 3000 (following
 the manufacturer’s instructions).
 3 After 24 h of transfection, coat a 96-well plate with Matrigel GFR. Add mTeSR supplemented with 10 µM Y-
 27632 into each well. Sort the GFP-expressing single cells into the prepared 96-well plate by ﬂow cytometer.
 4 After 2 d of sorting, change the medium to mTeSR without Y-27632.
 5 Repeat daily medium changes until a colony is observed.
 6 Passage and collect the colony. Isolate genomic DNA from part of the collected colony by using a blood and
 cell culture DNA mini kit (following the manufacturer’s instructions) and store the remaining cells.
 7 Conﬁrm the sequence of the target region of the gRNA.
 8 Expand the resulting clones for the organoid experiment.


 of primitive tissues segregates in the HBPOs after 30 d of culture (Fig. 4d–f). In conclusion, this
 HBPO system allows a detailed study of the early morphogenesis of HBP subdomains, and the
 generation of inter-connected, multi-organ structures in vitro from healthy and diseased PSC lines
 that can be reversibly manipulated by emerging technology such as genome editing (Box 2).
