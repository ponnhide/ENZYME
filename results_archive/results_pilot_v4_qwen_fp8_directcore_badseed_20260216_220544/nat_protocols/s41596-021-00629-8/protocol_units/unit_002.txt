 on Geltrex.
 1 Initiate monolayer culture using cells that have been maintained as colonies on irradiated mouse
 embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs; option A) or, alternatively, from a frozen stock of monolayer-derived
 cells (option B). Both options should result in a similar HFO differentiation efﬁciency.
 (A) Initiation of monolayer culture from hPSCs grown as colonies on MEFs ● Timing 20 min

 (i) Obtain a six-well plate of high-quality hPSCs grown on MEFs (~80% conﬂuency) in
 standard hPSC culture medium containing 20% KnockOut Serum Replacement (Fig. 3a).
 Dissociation of one well of the six-well plate should be sufﬁcient to inoculate one T25 ﬂask.

 (37 °C) for 10–20 min before use.
 (B) Initiation of monolayer culture from a monolayer frozen vial ● Timing 10 min (plus 2–4 d
 for maintenance)
 (i) Obtain a frozen vial of high-quality hPSCs established from prior monolayer culture.
 Our frozen vials usually contain 3 × 106 hPSCs.

 3 Add 5 mL of DMEM/F12 to the ﬂask, and rinse the ﬂask bottom with the medium to detach the
 cells. Transfer the resulting cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube, and centrifuge the tube at 300g
 for 3 min at 4 °C.
 4 Remove the supernatant, and gently resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of E8 + 10 μM Y27632.
 5 Count the cells and assess the cell viability by applying Trypan blue staining in a hemocytometer
 using standard methods (and previously described33).
 6 Take a prepared Geltrex-coated T25 ﬂask, aspirate the medium and add 5 mL E8 + 10 μM Y27632.
 7 Add 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells to the ﬂask, and place it into the incubator. Move the ﬂask a few times back
 and forth and left to right at the point where it is placed in the incubator to ensure that the cells are
 equally distributed (Supplementary Video 1).
 CRITICAL STEP The optimal seeding density has to be identiﬁed for every hPSC line as
 c


 previously described8,26. An appropriate seeding density is one that results in a conﬂuent
 monolayer of cells after 3–4 d of culture.
 8 Change the medium after 2 d and then daily by aspirating the medium and adding 5 mL of fresh E8
 (Y27632 is only required for cell seeding and so is not needed).
 9 After 3–4 d, the hPSCs will have formed a conﬂuent monolayer; passage again by repeating
 Steps 2–8.
 CRITICAL STEP For hPSCs precultured on MEFs (Step 1, option A), the cells have to be passaged
 c


 at least four times in monolayer culture on Geltrex to ensure complete depletion of MEFs before
 initiation of the HFO differentiation protocol.
 CRITICAL STEP For hPSCs inoculated from a monolayer-derived frozen stock (Step 1, option B),
 c


 we recommend at least two passages in monolayer culture before initiation of the HFO
 differentiation protocol.
 CRITICAL STEP We recommend maintaining hPSCs on MEFs and regularly starting a new
 c


 monolayer culture from there. Do not exceed eight passages in monolayer culture. We also
 recommend assessing the pluripotency of the cells regularly as previously described8.


 Generation of HFOs from hPSCs
 d-4: cell seeding and aggregate formation ● Timing 45 min
 CRITICAL HFO formation starts with a preculture period designated as day minus 4 (d-4) until
 c


 d-1; this comprises hPSC seeding, aggregate formation and Matrigel embedding, followed by the actual
 differentiation controlled by CHIR and IWP2 supplementation from d0 to d10 (Fig. 2). The timing
 listed for this and the following sections is for parallel formation of 36 HFOs (in three rows of a
 96-U-well plate).
 10 Detach hPSCs (from Step 9; at an appropriate passage) at 80–90% conﬂuence from a T25 by
 Accutase treatment, and count the cells as described in Steps 2–5.
 11 Prepare a stock cell suspension at a concentration of 5,000 cells per 100 µL medium by adding an
 appropriate amount of cells from Step 10 (based on the desired number of HFOs) to E8 + 10 μM
 Y27632. Gently resuspend the cells.
 CRITICAL STEP If aiming for a certain amount of HFOs, we recommend to seed 12 wells more
 c


 than would actually be required for the respective experiment to take into account potential loss of
 aggregates during the differentiation or failed differentiation of some HFOs. For example
 calculations, see Table 1.
 CRITICAL STEP An excess of 10–20% of the stock cell suspension is also recommended, which
 c


 facilitates proper pipetting and resuspension of the cells. For example calculations, see Table 1.

embedding of an hPSC aggregate in a Matrigel droplet (Steps 14–21). Scale bars, 500 μm.


 CRITICAL STEP Seeding an appropriate cell number is critical. For all tested cell lines, 5,000 cells
 c


 per well resulted in the successful formation of HFOs. Perform the cell counting with the
 hemocytometer carefully, and ensure proper preparation of the stock cell suspension. Ensure gentle
 but thorough resuspension of the cells in the culture medium to distribute the cells evenly.
 12 Seed 100 µL of the stock cell suspension per well of a U-shaped ultra-low attachment 96-well plate.
 Seed 12 wells (one row) more than the number of desired HFOs (Table 1).
 CRITICAL STEP After each row, pipet the remaining stock suspension up and down to
 c


 ensure homogeneous resuspension of the cells and thus the correct cell number in each well
 seeded afterward.
 13 Centrifuge the plate at 300g and 4 °C for 3 min to bring the cells to the culture plate bottom, and
 place the plate into the incubator.
 CRITICAL STEP Ensure that, after centrifugation, the hPSCs form a round cell pellet at the
 c


 culture plate bottom as shown in Fig. 4a. Place the plate into the incubator very carefully, and do
 not move it for at least 24 h to ensure that one round aggregate will form per well overnight.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING

 d-2: Matrigel embedding of hPSC aggregates ● Timing 2 h
 CRITICAL Two days after seeding (d-2), the hPSC aggregates are embedded in Matrigel droplets.
 c


 14 Before you start, take out the required amount of Matrigel aliquots from the freezer and let them
 thaw on ice. When the Matrigel is thawed, insert the aliquots into the ice. Take out the sterile
 scissors (heated to at least 180 °C for at least 3 h), and let them cool down at room temperature.
 CRITICAL STEP Ensure the Matrigel is not growth-factor-reduced (use cat. no. 354234) and has
 c


 an appropriate protein concentration; HFO formation has been validated with a Matrigel
 concentration range of 9.7–10.7 mg/mL. Do not use Geltrex instead of Matrigel since this will result
 in a failed differentiation based on our experience6.
 15 In the meantime, take a look at the 96-U-well plate under the microscope to check if the hPSC
 aggregates have properly formed. Mark the properly formed aggregates (these will be further
 embedded in Matrigel) and cross out the rest (not round or too small aggregates; see Fig. 4b for
 examples; these aggregates can be discarded later).
 CRITICAL STEP Embedding only properly formed aggregates (round, homogeneous,
 c


 ~550–650 µm in diameter) is important.

 16 Take a 2–20 µL pipet, cut off a piece of the tip holding the scissors at a ~90° angle relative to the tip,
 and set the pipet to 3 µL (this pipet will be used to pick the aggregates). Take a 10–100 µL pipet (or
 equivalent) and set it to 20 µL (this pipet will be used for making the Matrigel droplets). The
 aggregates will be embedded in the Matrigel droplets one by one.
 CRITICAL STEP The timing of HFO differentiation (starting time points) on the different days is
 c


 critical. Begin with Step 16 4–5 h later than the time point at which Step 10 has been started on d-4.
 See Table 2 for details.
 CRITICAL STEP Form one Matrigel droplet and embed one aggregate at a time to prevent
 c


 premature solidiﬁcation of the Matrigel.
 17 Pipet 20 µL of Matrigel into an empty well of the 96-U-well plate.
 CRITICAL STEP Depress the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop and discard the residual
 c


 volume to ensure that no air bubbles will be introduced into the Matrigel droplet. Bubbles within
 the droplets or the culture medium will cause the Matrigel droplets with the embedded aggregates
 to ﬂoat during the differentiation process, which will result in a failed differentiation. Make sure the
 Matrigel is pipetted very slowly.
 18 Pick a properly formed aggregate. To do this, use the cut tip (from Step 16), hold the plate almost
 perpendicularly and aspirate the aggregate. It might be easier to see the aggregates if a background
 is created, for example by placing a pipet tip box behind the plate.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 19 Insert the aggregate into the Matrigel droplet by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst
 stop to prevent the formation of bubbles. Place the lid onto the plate, and check visually if the aggregate
 is inside the droplet by carefully tilting the plate and looking at the Matrigel droplet from the plate
 bottom. Steps 16–19 are shown in Supplementary Video 2 and are schematically depicted in Fig. 4c.
 CRITICAL STEP It is important not to transfer too much culture medium with the aggregate into
 c


 the droplet (not more than 6 µL) to prevent dilution of the Matrigel. Thus, if embedding of an
 aggregate in one speciﬁc Matrigel droplet fails twice, do not continue with this droplet but rather
 make a new one.
 20 Repeat Steps 17–19 until all aggregates are embedded. Use a new tip for every Matrigel droplet. The
 cut tip does not necessarily have to be changed. Afterward, place the plate into the incubator for
 50–60 min to let the Matrigel solidify.
 21 Add 100 µL E8 per well. A multichannel pipet can be used in this step. Add the medium slowly and
 carefully, depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop to prevent damage and ﬂoating
 of the Matrigel droplets. Place the plate back into the incubator.

 d0, d1, d3, d5, d7: differentiation with CHIR and IWP2 ● Timing 30 min each

 c


 22 Remove the culture medium from the wells without aspirating or damaging the Matrigel droplets
 with the aggregates. We have used two methods and recommend users try out both methods to
 identify the most suitable.
 CRITICAL STEP Begin this step at approximately the same time of day that you started Step 16 on
 c


 d-2 (Table 2). It is important that all of the culture medium containing CHIR is removed from the
 wells; this step should be repeated if necessary.

 (A) Removing the culture medium with 1,000 µL and 200 µL tips
 (i) Hold the culture plate at a 45° angle. Use a 100–1,000 µL pipet to remove the culture
 medium above the Matrigel droplet until the droplet is exposed. Alternatively, a 20–200 µL
 pipet (or equivalent) can be used. Work carefully and slowly. It might be easier to see the
 Matrigel droplets with the aggregates if a background is created, for example by placing a
 pipet tip box behind the plate.
 (ii) To remove the rest of the medium around and below the Matrigel droplet, use a 20–200 µL
 pipet (or equivalent). Gently press the Matrigel droplet down to the wall of the well with
 the pipet tip.
 (iii) While aspirating the medium, move the pipet tip in a half-circle close to the well wall as
 schematically depicted in Fig. 5a and shown in Supplementary Video 3. Repeat this step, if
 the entire medium has not been removed from the well.
 (B) Removing the culture medium with stacked tips
 (i) Use a 20–200 µL pipet (or equivalent), and stack a 10 µL tip (autoclaved at 120 °C for
 20 min) on a 200 µL tip as shown in Fig. 5b.
 (ii) Carefully aspirate the medium as described in Step 22, option A. See also
 Supplementary Video 4.
 23 Switch off the lights and prepare RB− supplemented with 7.5 µM CHIR. Add 200 µL RB−/CHIR per well
 by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop. Place the plate back into the incubator.
 CRITICAL STEP CHIR is light-sensitive. Ensure the lights are switched off to work.
 c c


 CRITICAL STEP The culture medium volume during the CHIR treatment is critical, since the
 differentiation outcome is dependent on the correct bulk cell density14. Ensure pipetting is accurate,
 and add the medium to one well at a time. Do not use a multichannel pipet.
 CRITICAL STEP Note the time at which you end CHIR addition as the medium containing CHIR
 c


 has to be exchanged after 24 h (Table 2).
 CRITICAL STEP From this day onward, start monitoring the morphology of the developing
 c


 HFOs. An example is shown in Fig. 5c. Table 3 presents the expected size range of a developing
 HFO during the differentiation. However, cell-line-dependent variations may occur without
 indication of differentiation failure.

 CRITICAL STEP Since CHIR is light-sensitive, on d0, observe the aggregates under a microscope
 c


 before the medium change to prevent damage of the CHIR.
 24 24 h later (d1, Fig. 5c), remove the culture medium carefully as described in Step 22 and add 200 µL
 RB− per well by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop. The medium can be
 added using a multichannel pipet. Then, place the plate back into the incubator and start
 monitoring the morphology of the Matrigel droplets from this day onward.
 CRITICAL STEP Removing the culture medium containing CHIR precisely after 24 h is very
 c


 important. Although a delay of a maximum of 30 min did not have an adverse effect in our cell lines
 (Table 2), other cell lines might react more sensitively to a prolonged CHIR incubation time.
 CRITICAL STEP Ensure the entire culture medium containing CHIR is removed from the wells.
 c


 Repeat Step 22 if necessary.
 CRITICAL STEP Damaging the Matrigel droplets during the medium changes (Fig. 5d) might
 c


 cause the aggregates to drop out of the droplets (Fig. 5e), which will result in failed differentiation.
 To prevent this, ensure careful and slow pipetting during the medium changes.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 25 Two days later (d3, Fig. 5c), prepare RB− supplemented with 5 µM IWP2. Remove the culture
 medium carefully from the plate as described in Step 22, and add 200 µL RB−/IWP2 per well by
 depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop. The medium can be added using a
 multichannel pipet. Place the plate back into the incubator.
 CRITICAL STEP Begin this step at approximately the same time of day Step 22 was started on d0.
 c


 Note the end time point as the medium containing IWP2 has to be exchanged after 48 h (Table 2).
 26 48 h later (d5, Fig. 5c), remove the culture medium carefully (by repeating Step 22) and add 200 µL
 RB− per well by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop. A multichannel pipet
 can be used to add the medium. Place the plate back into the incubator afterward.
 CRITICAL STEP The culture medium containing IWP2 has to be removed after 48 h. Ideally, stay
 c


 on time; however, we found a delay of maximum 1 h did not have an adverse effect (Table 2).
 27 Two days later (d7, Fig. 5c), remove the culture medium (by repeating Step 22) and add 200 µL RB
 + per well by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop. The medium can be added
 using a multichannel pipet. This medium change can be performed at any time point (Table 2).
 Place the plate back into the incubator until d10 (the medium can but does not have to be changed
 on d8 and d9).
 CRITICAL STEP Although the timing is not important on d7, we recommend changing the
 c


 medium in the afternoon if a medium change on d8 or d9 is not planned.

 with any further experiments. Choose an appropriate magniﬁcation to see the entire HFO (in the
 front view, HFOs have a diameter of ~1.5–2 mm). If the HFOs have been generated using cells
 expressing a ﬂuorescence marker, remove the medium as described in Step 22 and add 200 µL PBS

 CRITICAL STEP Use only successfully formed HFOs for any further experiments since only these
 c


 HFOs will be properly patterned and contain all relevant cell lineages (Fig. 1)6. Using the HES3
 NKX2.5-eGFP reporter line28, in which cardiomyocytes express eGFP, successfully formed HFOs
 show a clear, layered pattern in the front view consisting of an IC comprising NKX2.5-eGFP-
 negative cells, an ML showing NKX2.5-eGFP-positive cells and an OL with both NKX2.5-eGFP-
 positive and -negative cells as shown in Fig. 6a, upper row and 6b. In contrast, aggregates not
 showing such layered pattern (Fig. 6a, bottom row) should be discarded. Notably, the three layers
 are also visible without the eGFP reporter in the bright-ﬁeld mode in the front view as shown in Fig.
 6c with the HES3 NKX2.5-eGFP line28 as well as the iPSC lines hHSC_Iso4_ADCF_SeV-iPS230 and
 iPSC-CB1RB9_WAS-GFP31. It will be easier to see the layers in the bright-ﬁeld mode, if the light
 intensity and/or the contrast are increased (Fig. 6c, middle and bottom rows). Note that the IC in
 the iPSC-CB1RB9_WAS-GFP HFO (Fig. 6c) is off-center because the HFO is slightly rotated. Since
 the OL contains mainly loose tissue, it may partially fuse into dense structures (for example, note
 the tail-like extension in the OL of the iPSC-CB1RB9_WAS-GFP HFO; Fig. 6c). Rotated HFOs and
 HFOs with dense structures in the OL are still considered successfully formed as long as the three
 layers are visible.

 29 If required, maintain the HFOs in culture in the 96-U-well plate in RB+. HFOs can be cultured for
 a maximum of another 2 weeks. Change the medium every 2–3 d by removing the old medium as
 described in Step 22 and adding 200 µL RB+ per well.
 30 If subsequent analysis requires removal of the HFOs from the 96-U-well plate, use a 100–1,000 µL
 pipet and cut off a piece of the pipet tip with sterile scissors holding them at a ~90° angle relative to
 the tip. Hold the plate at a 45° angle, and insert the pipet tip perpendicularly into the well. Ensure
 tight attachment of the edge of the tip to the well bottom while aspirating the HFO. The transfer of

 Dissociation of HFOs for replating or further analysis
 31 To dissociate and stain HFOs for subsequent ﬂow cytometry analysis, follow option A. A variation
 of the dissociation process is required to dissociate HFOs for subsequent single-cell RNA
 sequencing (scRNAseq) or replating of dissociated cells (for example, for subsequent patch clamp
 analysis), as described in option B.

 (ii) Transfer the HFOs from the 96-U-well plate to a V-shaped 96-well plate as described in
 Step 30 (one HFO per well).
 (iii) Carefully remove the rest of the culture medium as described in Step 22 (removing the

Anticipated results
 This protocol provides a method for the robust differentiation of HFOs from hPSCs. After some
 experience and accurate execution of the protocol, with established hPSC lines, ~90% of properly
 patterned HFOs should be obtained in each experiment6 (Fig. 7a). Proper patterning can be deter-
 mined by using the HES3 NKX2.5-eGFP reporter line and is identiﬁed by the formation of three
 layers in HFOs: the IC (comprising NKX2.5-eGFP-negative cells), the ML (NKX2.5-eGFP-positive
 cells) and the OL (NKX2.5-eGFP-positive and -negative cells) as shown in Fig. 6a,b. Notably, these
 layers can also be distinctly identiﬁed without the eGFP reporter contrast using conventional bright-
 ﬁeld microscopy (Fig. 6c). This assessment demonstrated that HFOs can be successfully generated for
 the established iPSC lines hHSC_Iso4_ADCF_SeV-iPS26,30 and iPSC-CB1RB9_WAS-GFP31 (Fig. 6c)
 as well as with several HES3-based (reporter) cell lines6. Figure 7a shows the HFO differentiation
 efﬁciencies for the abovementioned cell lines as well as for the HES3 MIXL1-GFP reporter line6,29,
 revealing similar efﬁciencies as for the HES3 NKX2.5-eGFP cell line.
 As noted above, only successfully formed HFOs showing the three morphologically distinct layers
 in the front view should be used for any subsequent analyses; only properly patterned HFOs com-
 prising heart and foregut anlagen as well as the vascular-like network will be informative for any
 envisioned assay. A cellular composition of ~40% cardiomyocytes (located in the ML and OL),
 ~4–5% ECs (distributed throughout the HFO but mainly found in the IC), ~20% AFE (located in the
 IC) and 10–15% liver progenitors/PFE (found in the OL, Fig. 1) is usually obtained. This can be
 identiﬁed by complementary scRNAseq and ﬂow cytometry assessment for relative cell type quan-
 tiﬁcation and morphologically observed by IF staining of numerous d13 HFOs6. The different tissues
 of HFOs can be analyzed by IF by staining with antibodies for cell-type-speciﬁc markers. Those
 include myosin heavy chain (MHC) or cardiac troponin T (cTnT) for cardiomyocytes (Fig. 7b,f,g),
 vimentin for mesenchymal cells (Fig. 7b), CD31 for endothelial and endocardial cells (Fig. 7c,d),
 SOX17 for endoderm (Fig. 7e), SOX2 for AFE (Fig. 7f) and HNF4α for liver progenitors/PFE (Fig.
 7g). Notably, the two endodermal compartments can be easily identiﬁed by their morphology
 (aggregate-like appearance of the PFE and cavity-forming AFE) without the requirement for tissue-
 speciﬁc IF staining (Fig. 7b–g).

 The tissues of HFOs have different physiological and physical properties, requiring distinct
 methodological approaches for proper analysis. Therefore, all methods applied for HFO analysis such
 as tissue dissociation, ﬁxation, staining, imaging or RNA extraction may require adaptations of the
 respective standard protocols to ensure meaningful results (see ref. 6).
 In this protocol, we provide a procedure for the dissociation and staining of individual HFOs in a
 96-well format followed by ﬂow cytometry, which is an excellent way to quantitatively analyze the
 tissue composition of HFOs (Steps 31–46). Figure 8 shows the gating strategy for a ﬂow cytometry
 analysis of a d13 HES3 NKX2.5-eGFP-derived HFO simultaneously stained with antibodies against
 cTnT and CD31 to mark cardiomyocytes and ECs, respectively. Following the gating of living cells
 and doublet exclusion, the analyzed HFO shows ~38% NKX2.5-eGFP-positive cells (the eGFP signal
 is preserved upon ﬁxation and staining using the Fix & Perm kit), ~36% cTnT-positive cardio-
 myocytes and ~4.5% CD31-positive ECs, consistent with our previously published results6.
