Procedure
 1 Collect up to three OVB organoids from day 30 or day 60 in a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for transferring
 organoids.
 2 Remove any carried-over medium carefully with a 200 µl micropipette tip without disturbing the organoids.
 3 Wash organoids three times with 3 ml of PBS and withdraw the PBS.
 4 Add 2 ml of Accutase containing 0.2 U/µl DNase I (prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath), close the tube tightly and incubate at 37 °C in a
 water bath.
 CRITICAL STEP Dissociation of organoids to single cells causes cell stress and cell death. It is possible to add Rock inhibitor into the Accutase
 c


 + DNase I solution during the incubation. However, if you are interested in cell death, cell survival, apoptosis, etc., in your scRNA-seq analysis,
 Rock inhibitor treatment will interfere with the naturally occurring apoptosis pathways and lead to compound-induced aberrant signaling.
 5 Check after 15 min for dissociation of organoids by shaking the tube and watching the integrity of organoids. Place the tube under a sterile hood
 and dissociate organoids by pipetting up and down with an uncut 1,000 µl micropipette tip.
 6 Place the tube back into a water bath and incubate for another 15 min at 37 °C.
 7 Repeat step 5.
 8 Place tube back and incubate for another 15 min at 37 °C. Do not exceed 45 min of Accutase treatment in total, since this would lead to too high
 a portion of dead cells and might decrease the success of the further procedure.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 9 Stop Accutase treatment by adding 8 ml DMEM/F12, prewarmed in a 37 °C waterbath.
 10 Filter the suspension through a sterile 70 µm diameter strainer to remove not dissociated connective tissue and create a purely single-cell
 suspension.
 11 Centrifuge cells at 500g for 5 min at RT.
 12 Aspirate medium and resuspend the cell pellet in 1ml of OVB organoid medium and count the cells. Perform Trypan-blue staining. It is
 recommended to obtain 65–95% cell viability to continue with the procedure.
 13 For scRNA library construction, you one can use, for example, Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v3. Follow the manufacturer´s instructions
 and target 2,000–3,000 cells per sample.
 14 Make a primer mixture Using primers containing an Ilumina R1 sequence (read 1 sequencing primer), a 16 bp 10× barcode, a 12 bp unique
 molecular identiﬁer and a poly-dT primer sequence.
 15 Mix primer mixture with cell lysate and master mix.
 16 Incubate the gel beads-in-emulsion (GEM’s (chips)) to produce barcoded, full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) from the originally poly-
 adenylated messenger RNA (mRNA). After the incubation, break the chips and recover the pooled cDNAs.
 17 Clean up the cDNAs from leftover biochemical and primers with the help of silane magnetic beads.
 18 Amplify the full-length barcoded cDNA by PCR for the library construction. For more details refer to the supporting work5.
