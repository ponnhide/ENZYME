Closely monitor cells under the tissue culture microscope until the cells start to round up.\n3 Dissociate the cells from the plate with a P1000 pipette and pipette the cells gently up and down (2–3×) to break up aggregates and to generate single cells.\nCRITICAL STEP Do not pipette the cells more than 2–3×, because single hPSCs are sensitive to mechanical stress.\n4 Resuspend the cells in 5 mL of aggregation medium using a 5‑mL serological pipette and collect the cells in a 15‑mL Falcon tube.\n5 For cell counting, mix 10 µL of cell suspension and 10 µL of 0.1% Trypan blue solution (included with the counting chamber slides) and pipette 10 µL of the mixture onto a counting chamber slide.",
