Brieﬂy, crypts of the healthy portion of the colonic epithelium (at least 10 cm away from the tumor side) were isolated by digestion of the intestinal mucosa in chelation solution (5.6 mM Na2HPO4, 8.0 mM KH2PO4,\n 96.2 mM NaCl, 1.6 mM KCl, 43.4 mM Sucrose, and 54.9 mM D-Sorbitol, Sigma)\n supplemented with dithiotreitol (0.5 mM, Sigma) and EDTA (2 mM, in-house) for\n 30 min at 4 °C. Colonic crypts were subsequently plated in basement membrane\n extract (BME; Cultrex PC BME RGF type 2, Amsbio). Organoids were grown in\n human intestinal stem cell medium (HISCM), which is composed of Advanced\n Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium/F12 supplemented with penicillin/streptomythan 10 mM HEPES and Glutamax (all Gibco, Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc) with 50%\n Wnt3a conditioned medium (in-house), 20% R-Spondin1 conditioned medium\n (in-house), 10% Noggin conditioned medium (in-house), 1x B27, 1.25mM N-acetyl\n cysteine, 10 mM nicotinamide, 50 ng/ml human EGF, 10 nM Gastrin, 500 nM A83-01,\n 10 nM prostaglandine E2 and 100 µg/ml Primocin (Invivogen).",
