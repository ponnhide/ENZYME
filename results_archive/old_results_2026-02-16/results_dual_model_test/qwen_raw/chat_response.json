        "content": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to convert the given protocol into ENZYME HL-IR JSON v0.4. First, I'll read through the entire protocol to understand all the steps.\n\nStarting with the \"Cell culture\" section. HEK293Ta cells are maintained in DMEM with FBS and penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2. They're tested for mycoplasma via nested PCR. So, the steps here would involve maintaining cells, which might be part of the initial setup. But in HL-IR, we need to break it down into specific steps.\n\nNext, \"Base-editing reporter cell lines\" section. Lentiviral transduction steps: seeding cells in 6-well plate, transfection with plasmids, harvesting supernatant, infection, puromycin selection, etc. Then \"Transfection\" for EGFP reporter assays, genomic assays, and genome-wide assays.\n\nI need to structure each step according to the HL-IR rules. Let's list all the steps mentioned.\n\nFirst, cell culture maintenance. But the protocol says \"HEK293Ta cells were purchased... maintained in DMEM...\". So maybe the initial step is allocating the cells? But the protocol doesn't specify how they were obtained, just that they were purchased. So perhaps the first step is allocating the cells from a source. But the protocol says \"purchased from GeneCopoeia\", so maybe the cells are a resource. But in the resources section, materials, containers, equipment, samples, data.\n\nWait, the resources section needs to have materials (like DMEM, FBS, etc.), containers (like 6-well plates, 96-well plates), equipment (like incubator, centrifuge), samples (like HEK293Ta cells), data (like PCR results).\n\nBut the protocol text describes the steps. Let's go step by step.\n\nStarting with \"Cell culture\" part: \"HEK293Ta cells were purchased... maintained in DMEM... supplemented with 10% FBS... at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination by nested PCR using culture medium as a template.\"\n\nSo steps here would be:\n\n- Maintaining cells in culture: this might involve transferring cells to a new container, but the text says \"maintained\", which is ongoing. But in the protocol steps, perhaps the initial setup is part of the protocol. However, the protocol might not have explicit steps for maintaining, but rather the steps for the experiments.\n\nWait, the main protocol steps are:\n\n1. Lentiviral packaging: seeding cells in 6-well plate, transfection with plasmids, changing medium, harvesting supernatant, storing at -80°C.\n\n2. Lentiviral infection: seeding cells, adding viral supernatant with polybrene, then reseeding for titer measurement, puromycin selection.\n\n3. Transfection for EGFP reporter assays: seeding in collagen-coated 24-well plate, transfection with PEI, plasmids, then imaging.\n\n4. Genomic on/off-target assays: seeding in 96-well plate, transfection.\n\n5. Genome-wide DNA/RNA off-target assays: seeding in 6-well plate, transfection.\n\nSo each of these steps needs to be converted into HL-IR steps.\n\nLet's start with the first part: \"For lentiviral packaging, ~2 × 105 cells per well were seeded in a 6-well plate 1 day before transfection.\"\n\nSo this is a step where cells are seeded into a 6-well plate. So the action is \"transfer\" or \"allocate\"? Wait, seeding cells usually involves transferring cells from a stock to a new container. So \"transfer\" with amount (cell count), into a container.\n\nBut in HL-IR, the \"transfer\" action is for moving samples between containers. So seeding cells would be a transfer step where you transfer cells (sample) into a container (6-well plate).\n\nBut the cells are a sample. So the input would be the cell sample, output is the same sample in a new container.\n\nBut the protocol says \"seeded in a 6-well plate\", so the cells are being transferred into the plate.\n\nSo step: transfer cells into 6-well plate. The amount is ~2e5 cells per well. But how to represent that? The transfer.params should have \"amount\" as a quantity object. So \"amount\": {\"value\": 2e5, \"unit\": \"cells\", \"per_well\": true? Or maybe \"per_well\" is part of the description. But the standard is to have \"amount\" as a quantity with value and unit. So \"value\": 200000, \"unit\": \"cells\", but since it's per well, maybe the container is a 6-well plate, so each well has that amount. But the HL-IR might not have per_well, but the container is specified as a 6-well plate, and the transfer is to the container, with the amount per well. But the protocol says \"seeded in a 6-well plate\", so the total cells would be 2e5 per well, but the plate has 6 wells. However, the step might be for each well, but the protocol says \"per well\", so maybe the transfer is for each well. But in HL-IR, the container would be the 6-well plate, and the amount is per well. But how to represent that? Maybe the \"amount\" is 2e5 cells, and the container is a 6-well plate, but the step is for seeding all wells. Alternatively, perhaps the step is to transfer cells into the plate, with the amount specified as 2e5 cells per well, but the JSON would have \"amount\": {\"value\": 200000, \"unit\": \"cells\", \"per_well\": true} but the schema might not have \"per_well\". Wait, the schema for transfer.params says \"amount\" should be a quantity object. So the quantity object has \"value\" and \"unit\", and possibly \"per_well\" as part of the description. But the standard is to have \"value\" and \"unit\", and maybe the container is a 6-well plate, so the amount is per well. But the HL-IR might not have a specific field for per_well, so perhaps the amount is just 2e5 cells, and the container is a 6-well plate, but the step is for each well. However, the protocol says \"seeded in a 6-well plate\", so maybe the step is to transfer cells into the plate, with the amount per well. But the JSON would have \"amount\": {\"value\": 200000, \"unit\": \"cells\"} and the container is a 6-well plate. But the actual transfer would be for each well, but the protocol might not specify per well in the amount. Alternatively, maybe the amount is total for the plate, but the protocol says \"per well\", so 2e5 per well, so total 1.2e6 cells for the plate. But the step might be to transfer cells into the plate, with the amount per well. However, the HL-IR might not have a way to specify per well, so perhaps the amount is 2e5 cells, and the container is a single well, but the protocol says \"6-well plate\", so the container is the entire plate. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"transfer\" step is to transfer cells into the container (6-well plate), and the amount is specified as 2e5 cells per well. But the quantity object in HL-IR for transfer.params should have \"value\" and \"unit\", so \"value\": 200000, \"unit\": \"cells\", and perhaps the container is a 6-well plate, but the step is for each well. However, the HL-IR might not have a way to specify per well, so maybe the step is for the entire plate, but the amount would be 2e5 * 6 = 1.2e6 cells. But the protocol says \"per well\", so perhaps the step is for each well, but the JSON would have the amount as 2e5 cells per well, but the container is the 6-well plate. But the HL-IR might not have a per_well field, so perhaps the amount is just 2e5 cells, and the container is a single well, but the protocol says \"6-well plate\", so maybe the container is the plate, and the amount is per well. But the HL-IR might not have a way to specify that. Alternatively, maybe the step is to transfer cells into the plate, and the amount is 2e5 cells per well, but the JSON would have \"amount\": {\"value\": 200000, \"unit\": \"cells\"} and the container is a 6-well plate. But the actual transfer would be for each well, but the JSON doesn't specify per well. Maybe the protocol step is to seed the cells into the plate, and the amount is per well, but the JSON just has the amount as 2e5 cells, and the container is the plate. But that's not precise. Alternatively, perhaps the container is a single well, but the protocol says \"6-well plate\", so the container is the plate. Hmm.\n\nThis is a common issue in HL-IR. The key is to follow the exact wording. The protocol says \"seeded in a ",
