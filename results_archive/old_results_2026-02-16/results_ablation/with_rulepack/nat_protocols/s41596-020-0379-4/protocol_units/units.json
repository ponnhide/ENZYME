Carefully monitor digestion, and for <2-h incubations, mix contents every 10–15 min by shaking vigorously and by pipetting the mixture up and down using a P1000 pipette. For overnight incubations, place the mixture on a shaker. Addition of 10 µM ROCK inhibitor during digestion can increase outgrowth efﬁciency. For head and neck organoids, digestion should not exceed 1 h and should be monitored regularly.",

For TrypLE‑based cell dissociation, resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of TrypLE, pipette up and down and incubate at 37 °C until organoids fall apart. Pipette up and down with a P1000 ﬁlter tip with a (non‑ﬁltered) P10 tip on top for ≥10 times every 3–5 min to aid disruption of the organoids. Monitor digestion closely to keep the incubation time in TrypLE to a minimum. In case of mechanical disruption, resuspend the pellet in 3 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium. Use a P1000 ﬁlter pipette tip with a (non‑ﬁltered) P10 tip on top to pipette the organoid suspension up and down 30 times.",

When using the Thermo system, start by washing the tubes with MilliQ water, followed by a wash with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol solution. Wash once with PBS. Subsequently, wash again with PBS from a clean 50‑ml conical tube. In general, clean tubes filled with solutions should be used only once, to prevent ‘contamination’ from previous wash steps being passed on to the next washing solution. A ‘wash’ is deﬁned as ﬂushing a minimum of twice the tube volume of liquid per tube through the tubing. Do not let the tubing dry after priming with PBS or medium, since the salts in the solution will form crystals in the tubes. 52 Before priming with organoids, ﬂush the tubing at least once with ice‑cold adDMEM/F12+++. 53 Invert Falcon tubes with organoid suspension to ensure that the organoid solution is homogeneously distributed (organoids will sink to the bottom of the tube if left standing still). After ensuring a homogeneous distribution, prime the tubing with organoids until the solution has completely passed through the tubing. 54 Start the program to dispense the organoid solution into a black‑/clear‑bottom ultra‑low attachment 384‑well cell culture plate. Our setting is a 384‑well cell culture plate format, with 40 µl per well.",
