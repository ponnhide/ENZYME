51 Wash the tubing of the dispenser according to the manufacturer’s instructions. When using the Thermo system, start by washing the tubes with MilliQ water, followed by a wash with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol solution. Wash once with PBS. Subsequently, wash again with PBS from a clean 50‑ml conical tube. In general, clean tubes filled with solutions should be used only once, to prevent ‘contamination’ from previous wash steps being passed on to the next washing solution. A ‘wash’ is deﬁned as ﬂushing a minimum of twice the tube volume of liquid per tube through the tubing. Do not let the tubing dry after priming with PBS or medium, since the salts in the solution will form crystals in the tubes. 52 Before priming with organoids, ﬂush the tubing at least once with ice‑cold adDMEM/F12+++. 53 Invert Falcon tubes with organoid suspension to ensure that the organoid solution is homogeneously distributed (organoids will sink to the bottom of the tube if left standing still). After ensuring a homogeneous distribution, prime the tubing with organoids until the solution has completely passed through the tubing. 54 Start the program to dispense the organoid solution into a black‑/clear‑bottom ultra‑low attachment 384‑well cell culture plate. Our setting is a 384‑well cell culture plate format, with 40 µl per well.
