34 Add 1 ml of 1.6% (vol/vol) FA/PBS solution made fresh from 16% (vol/vol) FA to the cells and incubate for 10 min on a rocker at room temperature.
35 Add 2 ml of CSB to the cells, centrifuge at 800g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.
36 Prepare intercalation buffer by diluting 1 µl of 125 µM Cell-ID Intercalator-Ir in 1 ml of Fix & Perm buffer (ﬁnal concentration = 125 nM).
37 Resuspend cells in 1 ml of intercalation buffer, gently vortex and incubate for 1 h on a rocker at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.
