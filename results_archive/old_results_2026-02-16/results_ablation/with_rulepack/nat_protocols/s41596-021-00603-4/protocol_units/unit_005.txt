8 Transfer 200 µl of pre-aliquoted TOBis barcodes to corresponding organoid samples in a 96-well plate (from Step 7). Any barcode combination can be used to stain any culture condition (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Incubate the cells overnight at 4 °C.
9 Remove the barcoding solutions by pipetting and wash the cells with 200 µl of 2 mM glutathione/ CSB for 10 min on a rocker at room temperature. Repeat the wash twice.
10 Wash the cells with 200 µl of PBS for 10 min on a rocker at room temperature. Repeat the wash.
