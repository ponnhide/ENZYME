4 Remove culture medium by pipetting. Add 200 µl of prewarmed (37 °C) 4% (vol/vol) PFA into each well, taking care not to disrupt Matrigel. Incubate for 60 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.
5 Remove PFA solution by pipetting, taking care not to disturb the Matrigel. Wash the cells with PBS on a rocker (speed set at ~45 rpm throughout the protocol) for 10 min at room temperature (~20 °C). Repeat the wash.
6 Remove PBS by pipetting. Add 200 µl of 0.25 µM 194cisplatin/PBS solution to each well and incubate for 10–15 min on a rocker at room temperature.
7 Remove the 194cisplatin solution by pipetting. Wash cells with PBS on a rocker for 10 min at room temperature. Repeat the wash.
