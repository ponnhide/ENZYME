Handle the aspiration and refilling carefully to avoid disrupting the assembloids.\n43. Thirty days after assembloid formation, assess interneuron migration in the hFA by using a fluorescence microscope. GFP+ cells that have migrated to the hCO region should be readily visible (Fig. 3h). hFA with minimal interneuron migration to the hCO side were excluded from analysis (~10% of total hFA were excluded on the basis of this criterion).",
