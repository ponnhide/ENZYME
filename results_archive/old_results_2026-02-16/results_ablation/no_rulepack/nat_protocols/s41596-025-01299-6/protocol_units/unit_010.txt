71. Aspirate the medium from hiPS cells cultured in six-well plates and wash the cells twice with DPBS.
72. Add 1 ml of pre-warmed Accutase to each well. Incubate at 37 °C for 7 min in a 5% CO2 incubator.
73. Add 1 ml of pre-warmed E8 medium per well to the cells and collect the suspensions into 15-ml conical tubes. Gently pipette the cell suspension a few times with a serological pipette to ensure that any remining clumps are fully dissociated. Centrifuge the samples at 200g for 5 min.
74. Aspirate the supernatant and then resuspend the cells in E8 medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632. Count the cells manually by using a Bright-Line hemacytometer.
75. We use 0.5 million hiPS cells per nucleofection reaction. To generate 15 KO cell pools for 15 target genes, plus one negative control, a total of 8 million cells is required. An additional 1 million cells are included to account for potential loss during the process. Therefore, transfer 9 million cells to a new 15-ml Falcon tube and centrifuge at 200g for 5 min.
76. Aspirate the supernatant completely and resuspend the cells with 360 μl of nucleofection solution.
77. Transfer 20 μl of the hiPS cell suspension into each well of the 96-well plate containing 5 μl of RNP complex. Mix two to three times through pipetting.
78. Transfer each cell-RNP mixture (25 μl) to each well of the Nucleocuvette strips. Click the lid tight.
79. Gently tap the strip on the benchtop to make sure that the sample covers the bottom of the cuvette and that there are no bubbles in the wells.
