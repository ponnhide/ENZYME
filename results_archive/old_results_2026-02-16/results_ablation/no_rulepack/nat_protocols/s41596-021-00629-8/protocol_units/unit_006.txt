22 Remove the culture medium from the wells without aspirating or damaging the Matrigel droplets with the aggregates. We have used two methods and recommend users try out both methods to identify the most suitable.
CRITICAL STEP Begin this step at approximately the same time of day that you started Step 16 on d‑2 (Table 2). It is important that all of the culture medium containing CHIR is removed from the wells; this step should be repeated if necessary.
23 Switch off the lights and prepare RB− supplemented with 7.5 µM CHIR. Add 200 µL RB−/CHIR per well by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the first stop. Place the plate back into the incubator.
CRITICAL STEP CHIR is light‑sensitive. Ensure the lights are switched off to work.
CRITICAL STEP The culture medium volume during the CHIR treatment is critical, since the differentiation outcome is dependent on the correct bulk cell density14. Ensure pipetting is accurate, and add the medium to one well at a time. Do not use a multichannel pipet.
CRITICAL STEP Note the time at which you end CHIR addition as the medium containing CHIR has to be exchanged after 24 h (Table 2).
