(B) Initiation of monolayer culture from a monolayer frozen vial ● Timing 10 min (plus 2–4 d for maintenance)
(i) Obtain a frozen vial of high-quality hPSCs established from prior monolayer culture. Our frozen vials usually contain 3 × 10⁶ hPSCs.
(ii) Prepare a 15 mL conical tube with 10 mL cold (4 °C) DMEM/F12, and transfer the content of the vial into the conical tube.
CRITICAL STEP Work fast to prevent cell damage.
(iii) Centrifuge the conical tube at 300 g for 3 min at 4 °C.
(iv) Remove the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of E8 + 10 μM Y27632.
(v) Take a prepared Geltrex-coated T25 ﬂask, aspirate the medium and add 4 mL E8 + 10 μM Y27632.
(vi) Transfer the cell suspension from (iv) to the T25 ﬂask, and place the ﬂask into the incubator. Move the ﬂask a few times back and forth and left to right at the point where it is placed in the incubator to ensure that the cells are equally distributed (Supplementary Video 1).
(vii) Change the medium after 2 d and then daily by aspirating the medium and adding 5 mL of fresh E8. When the cells are conﬂuent, proceed to the next step.
CRITICAL STEP Prewarm the required amount of culture medium in a water bath (37 °C) for 10–20 min before use.
