25 Two days later (d3, Fig. 5c), prepare RB− supplemented with 5 µM IWP2. Remove the culture medium carefully from the plate as described in Step 22, and add 200 µL RB−/IWP2 per well by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the first stop. The medium can be added using a multichannel pipet. Place the plate back into the incubator.
CRITICAL STEP Begin this step at approximately the same time of day Step 22 was started on d0. Note the end time point as the medium containing IWP2 has to be exchanged after 48 h (Table 2).
26 48 h later (d5, Fig. 5c), remove the culture medium carefully (by repeating Step 22) and add 200 µL RB− per well by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the first stop. A multichannel pipet can be used to add the medium. Place the plate back into the incubator afterward.
CRITICAL STEP The culture medium containing IWP2 has to be removed after 48 h. Ideally, stay on time; however, we found a delay of maximum 1 h did not have an adverse effect (Table 2).
