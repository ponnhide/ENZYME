The timing listed for this and the following sections is for parallel formation of 36 HFOs (in three rows of a 96‑U‑well plate).\n10 Detach hPSCs (from Step 9; at an appropriate passage) at 80–90% conﬂuence from a T25 by Accutase treatment, and count the cells as described in Steps 2–5.\n11 Prepare a stock cell suspension at a concentration of 5,000 cells per 100 µL medium by adding an appropriate amount of cells from Step 10 (based on the desired number of HFOs) to E8 + 10 µM Y27632.

For example calculations, see Table 1.\nCRITICAL STEP An excess of 10–20% of the stock cell suspension is also recommended, which facilitates proper pipetting and resuspension of the cells. For example calculations, see Table 1.\n12 Seed 100 µL of the stock cell suspension per well of a U‑shaped ultra‑low attachment 96‑well plate.

      "text": "d‑2: Matrigel embedding of hPSC aggregates ● Timing 2 h\nCRITICAL Two days after seeding (d‑2), the hPSC aggregates are embedded in Matrigel droplets.\n14 Before you start, take out the required amount of Matrigel aliquots from the freezer and let them thaw on ice. When the Matrigel is thawed, insert the aliquots into the ice. Take out the sterile scissors (heated to at least 180 °C for at least 3 h), and let them cool down at room temperature.\nCRITICAL STEP Ensure the Matrigel is not growth‑factor‑reduced (use cat. no. 354234) and has an appropriate protein concentration; HFO formation has been validated with a Matrigel concentration range of 9.7–10.7 mg/mL. Do not use Geltrex instead of Matrigel since this will result in a failed differentiation based on our experience6.\n15 In the meantime, take a look at the 96‑U‑well plate under the microscope to check if the hPSC aggregates have properly formed. Mark the properly formed aggregates (these will be further embedded in Matrigel) and cross out the rest (not round or too small aggregates; see Fig. 4b for examples; these aggregates can be discarded later).\nCRITICAL STEP Embedding only properly formed aggregates (round, homogeneous, ~550–650 µm in diameter) is important.\n16 Take a 2–20 µL pipet, cut off a piece of the tip holding the scissors at a ~90° angle relative to the tip, and set the pipet to 3 µL (this pipet will be used to pick the aggregates). Take a 10–100 µL pipet (or equivalent) and set it to 20 µL (this pipet will be used for making the Matrigel droplets). The aggregates will be embedded in the Matrigel droplets one by one.\nCRITICAL STEP The timing of HFO differentiation (starting time points) on the different days is critical. Begin with Step 16 4–5 h later than the time point at which Step 10 has been started on d‑4. See Table 2 for details.\nCRITICAL STEP Form one Matrigel droplet and embed one aggregate at a time to prevent premature solidiﬁcation of the Matrigel.\n17 Pipet 20 µL of Matrigel into an empty well of the 96‑U‑well plate.\nCRITICAL STEP Depress the plunger of the pipet only until the first stop and discard the residual volume to ensure that no air bubbles will be introduced into the Matrigel droplet. Bubbles within the droplets or the culture medium will cause the Matrigel droplets with the embedded aggregates to ﬂoat during the differentiation process, which will result in a failed differentiation. Make sure the Matrigel is pipetted very slowly.\n18 Pick a properly formed aggregate. To do this, use the cut tip (from Step 16), hold the plate almost perpendicularly and aspirate the aggregate. It might be easier to see the aggregates if a background is created, for example by placing a pipet tip box behind the plate.\n19 Insert the aggregate into the Matrigel droplet by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the first stop to prevent the formation of bubbles. Place the lid onto the plate, and check visually if the aggregate is inside the droplet by carefully tilting the plate and looking at the Matrigel droplet from the plate bottom. Steps 16–19 are shown in Supplementary Video 2 and are schematically depicted in Fig. 4c.\nCRITICAL STEP It is important not to transfer too much culture medium with the aggregate into the droplet (not more than 6 µL) to prevent dilution of the Matrigel. Thus, if embedding of an aggregate in one speciﬁc Matrigel droplet fails twice, do not continue with this droplet but rather make a new one.\n20 Repeat Steps 17–19 until all aggregates are embedded. Use a new tip for every Matrigel droplet. The cut tip does not necessarily have to be changed. Afterward, place the plate into the incubator for 50–60 min to let the Matrigel solidify.\n21 Add 100 µL E8 per well. A multichannel pipet can be used in this step. Add the medium slowly and carefully, depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the first stop to prevent damage and ﬂoating of the Matrigel droplets. Place the plate back into the incubator.",
