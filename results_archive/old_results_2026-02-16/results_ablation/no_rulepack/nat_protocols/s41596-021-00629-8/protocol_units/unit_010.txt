(B) Dissociation of HFOs for subsequent scRNAseq or replating of dissociated cells ● Timing 30 min
(i) Thaw an aliquot of STEMdiff Cardiomyocyte Support Medium at room temperature. For each HFO, prepare a conical tube with 500 µL of the STEMdiff Cardiomyocyte Support Medium supplemented with 10 µM Y27632.
(ii) Dissociate the HFOs in a 96‑well plate using the STEMdiff Cardiomyocyte Dissociation Medium as described in option A steps (i–vii). However, the HFOs do not have to be transferred to a V‑shaped 96‑well plate but can remain in the 96‑U‑well plate.
(iii) Transfer the dissociated HFOs to the prepared conical tubes, and centrifuge at 300 g for 3 min at 4 °C.
(iv) Remove the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellets in an appropriate buffer for subsequent scRNAseq analysis or in RB+ supplemented with 10 µM Y27632 for replating the cells onto a Geltrex‑coated cell culture plate.
