d10: monitoring and collection of HFOs ● Timing 30 min
CRITICAL 3 d later (d10, Fig. 5c, Fig. 6), differentiation is completed.
28 We highly recommend taking images under an inverted microscope (to observe the HFOs from the culture plate bottom; take bright‑field and fluorescence pictures if applicable) before proceeding with any further experiments. Choose an appropriate magnification to see the entire HFO (in the front view, HFOs have a diameter of ~1.5–2 mm). If the HFOs have been generated using cells expressing a fluorescence marker, remove the medium as described in Step 22 and add 200 µL PBS w/o per well before taking the images. If the HFOs are floating, remove some of the PBS w/o until the HFOs fall onto the culture plate bottom. The HFOs can be monitored directly in the 96‑U‑well plate.
CRITICAL STEP Use only successfully formed HFOs for any further experiments since only these HFOs will be properly patterned and contain all relevant cell lineages (Fig. 1)6. Using the HES3 NKX2.5‑eGFP reporter line28, in which cardiomyocytes express eGFP, successfully formed HFOs show a clear, layered pattern in the front view consisting of an IC comprising NKX2.5‑eGFP‑negative cells, an ML showing NKX2.5‑eGFP‑positive cells and an OL with both NKX2.5‑eGFP‑positive and ‑negative cells as shown in Fig. 6a, upper row and 6b. In contrast, aggregates not showing such layered pattern (Fig. 6a, bottom row) should be discarded.
