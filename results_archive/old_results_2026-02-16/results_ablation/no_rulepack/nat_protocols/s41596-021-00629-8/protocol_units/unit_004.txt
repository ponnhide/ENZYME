d‑4: cell seeding and aggregate formation ● Timing 45 min
CRITICAL HFO formation starts with a preculture period designated as day minus 4 (d‑4) until d‑1; this comprises hPSC seeding, aggregate formation and Matrigel embedding, followed by the actual differentiation controlled by CHIR and IWP2 supplementation from d0 to d10 (Fig. 2). The timing listed for this and the following sections is for parallel formation of 36 HFOs (in three rows of a 96‑U‑well plate).
10 Detach hPSCs (from Step 9; at an appropriate passage) at 80–90% conﬂuence from a T25 by Accutase treatment, and count the cells as described in Steps 2–5.
11 Prepare a stock cell suspension at a concentration of 5,000 cells per 100 µL medium by adding an appropriate amount of cells from Step 10 (based on the desired number of HFOs) to E8 + 10 µM Y27632. Gently resuspend the cells.
CRITICAL STEP If aiming for a certain amount of HFOs, we recommend to seed 12 wells more than would actually be required for the respective experiment to take into account potential loss of aggregates during the differentiation or failed differentiation of some HFOs. For example calculations, see Table 1.
CRITICAL STEP An excess of 10–20% of the stock cell suspension is also recommended, which facilitates proper pipetting and resuspension of the cells. For example calculations, see Table 1.
12 Seed 100 µL of the stock cell suspension per well of a U‑shaped ultra‑low attachment 96‑well plate. Seed 12 wells (one row) more than the number of desired HFOs (Table 1).
CRITICAL STEP After each row, pipet the remaining stock suspension up and down to ensure homogeneous resuspension of the cells and thus the correct cell number in each well seeded afterward.
13 Centrifuge the plate at 300 g and 4 °C for 3 min to bring the cells to the culture plate bottom, and place the plate into the incubator.
CRITICAL STEP Ensure that, after centrifugation, the hPSCs form a round cell pellet at the culture plate bottom as shown in Fig. 4a. Place the plate into the incubator very carefully, and do not move it for at least 24 h to ensure that one round aggregate will form per well overnight.
