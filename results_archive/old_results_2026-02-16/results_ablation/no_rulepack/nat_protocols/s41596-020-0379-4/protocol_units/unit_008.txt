32 Add the required volume of cell‑freezing medium, and pipette up and down using a P1000 pipette to properly resuspend the organoids.
CRITICAL 500 µl of freezing medium should be used for four ‘original’ wells with organoids of a 24‑well cell culture plate.
33 Per sterile cryogenic vial, add 500 µl of freezing medium with the resuspended organoids.
34 Place the cryogenic vial into a freezing container. Store the freezing container with the samples at –80 °C.
35 After storage at –80 °C for 24 h, remove the vials from the freezing container, and transfer them to the liquid nitrogen tank (approximately –180 °C).
