51 Wash the tubing of the dispenser according to the manufacturer’s instructions. When using the Thermo system, start by washing the tubes with MilliQ water, followed by a wash with 70 % (vol/vol) ethanol solution. Wash once with PBS. Subsequently, wash again with PBS from a clean 50‑ml conical tube. In general, clean tubes filled with solutions should be used only once, to prevent ‘contamination’ from previous wash steps being passed on to the next washing solution.
CRITICAL Tubing should be calibrated before usage, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Calibrate at least every 3 months, although we recommend checking if calibration is still accurate before each screen to minimize variation in the assay plate.
52 Before priming with organoids, flush the tubing at least once with ice‑cold adDMEM/F12+++ medium.
53 Invert Falcon tubes with organoid suspension to ensure that the organoid solution is homogeneously distributed (organoids will sink to the bottom of the tube if left standing still).
54 Start the program to dispense the organoid solution into a black‑/clear‑bottom ultra‑low attachment 384‑well cell culture plate. Our setting is a 384‑well cell culture plate format, with 40 µl per well.
CRITICAL Make sure that the protocol is started as quickly as possible after priming is complete; otherwise, organoids will sink to the bottom of the tube and will not be homogeneously dispensed over the culture plate.
