1 Collect primary human tissue pieces, separated by biopsy site and/or tissue type (i.e., normal and tumor tissue) in 45 ml of ice‑cold adDMEM/F12+++ medium in 50‑ml conical tubes. (Optional) Add 10 µM ROCK inhibitor to adDMEM/F12+++ medium to increase cell survival. Keep tissue samples in this medium at 4 °C until the start of the isolation.
