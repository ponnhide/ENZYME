Change the medium every other day for 2 weeks by removing 50 % of the old medium (150 μL) and adding 150 μL fresh amplification medium with 2× concentrations of FGF2 and EGF to achieve final FGF2 and EGF concentrations of 10 ng/mL. Take images of SNR‑derived organoids at 1, 7 and 14 d post‑isolation to document organoid development (Figs. 3 and 4).
