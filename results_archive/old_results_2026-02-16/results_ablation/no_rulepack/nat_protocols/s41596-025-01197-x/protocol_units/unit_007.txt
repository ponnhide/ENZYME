Transfer 1‑month‑old organoids (before MG embedding) to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube using a P200 pipette tip cut to avoid damaging the organoids. Let organoids settle to the bottom, aspirate the medium and rinse once with sterile PBS. Discard the papain solution, add 500 μL of trypsin inhibitor, and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C. Dissociate organoids into single cells by repeated pipetting with a P1000 pipette.
