Identify large SNRs (>200 μm in diameter) with a clearly visible single lumen for isolation under a stereoscope (Fig. 2e,f). Carefully separate SNRs from the adjacent tissue using the glass hook and gently detach each one from the bottom of the dish (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Video 2). Transfer isolated SNRs to 96‑well plate (one SNR per well) using a P200 filtered pipette and return the plate to the incubator.
