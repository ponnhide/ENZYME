Organoid preparation and mounting: transfer a 5‑month‑old organoid to a 6 cm dish with ice‑cold, oxygenated cutting ACSF using a P1000 pipette tip cut to avoid damaging the organoid. Slicing: cut 350‑µm‑thick slices using the vibratome set to 100 Hz frequency, 1.2 mm amplitude and a slow (3–6 mm/min) forward movement velocity. Patch‑clamp experiment: transfer a slice into the recording chamber using a wide Pasteur pipette. Place a harp slice grid over the slice to hold it in place during the experiment and start perfusion with oxygenated ACSF at a flow rate of ~3 mL/min.
