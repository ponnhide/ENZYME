Warm a 6‑well plate with MG‑coated wells by placing it in a 37 °C, 5 % CO₂ incubator for ~30 min or keeping it at room temperature for 1 h in a biosafety cabinet. Take a frozen aliquot of cells from liquid nitrogen and thaw the aliquot by dipping it in a 37 °C water bath while monitoring the process every few seconds. Spin cells down at 1,000 rpm (300 g) for 4 min at room temperature. Add 3 mL of stem cell medium with Y‑27632 and gently resuspend the pellet using the 5 mL serological pipet.
