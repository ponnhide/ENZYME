Fixation: transfer organoids to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube using a P200 pipette tip cut to avoid damaging the organoids. Let organoids settle to the bottom, aspirate the medium and rinse once with sterile PBS. Discard the supernatant, add 250 μL of 4 % PFA and incubate overnight at 4 °C. Dilute primary antibodies in 3 % BSA with 0.3 % Triton‑X 100 in PBS. Cover the sections and incubate overnight at 4 °C in a humidifying chamber.
