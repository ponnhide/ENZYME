Place a box of P200 pipette tips in a −20 °C freezer for at least 15 min to cool them before use for embedding. Thaw MG aliquot(s) on ice 1–2 h before embedding; 30 μL of MG will be needed for embedding each organoid. Cut an ~40 mm square of Parafilm and disinfect it by spraying with 70 % ethanol. Fill the lid with MG droplets containing organoids, incubate at 37 °C for 30 min to gelate, then transfer the droplets into a 10 cm Petri dish with organoid propagation medium and place on an orbital shaker for long‑term culture.
