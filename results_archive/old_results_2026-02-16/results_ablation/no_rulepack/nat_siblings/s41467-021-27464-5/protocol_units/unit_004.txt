A 20 µL droplet of Biosilk protein solution was placed in the center of hydrophobic culture wells in a 24-well plate (Sarstedt, #833922500). Recombinant human laminin-111 was added to the silk protein solution at a final concentration of 10 μg ml−1. The FN-silk/LN-111 mixture was incubated 10 min at RT before usage.
