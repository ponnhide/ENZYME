VM organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 h at 4 °C followed by washing in PBS three times for 10 min. The interaction were left to sink in 30% sucrose overnight. Sucrose solution was replaced with 1:1 OCT:30% sucrose mixture for 6 h and then transferred to a cryomold and filled with OCT. The embedded tissue was frozen on dry ice and either cryosectioned at 20 μm or stored at −80 °C.
