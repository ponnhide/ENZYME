 Isolation of tissue-specific fetal stem cells and derivation of primary
 organoids is limited to samples obtained from termination of pregnancies,
 hampering prenatal investigation of fetal development and congenital
 diseases. Therefore, new patient-specific in vitro models are needed. To this
 aim, isolation and expansion of fetal stem cells during pregnancy, without
 the need for tissue samples or reprogramming, would be advantageous.
 Amniotic fluid (AF) is a source of cells from multiple developing organs.
 Using single-cell analysis, we characterized the cellular identities present
 in human AF. We identified and isolated viable epithelial stem/progenitor
 cells of fetal gastrointestinal, renal and pulmonary origin. Upon culture,
 these cells formed clonal epithelial organoids, manifesting small intestine,
 kidney tubule and lung identity. AF organoids exhibit transcriptomic,
 protein expression and functional features of their tissue of origin. With
 relevance for prenatal disease modeling, we derived lung organoids from
 AF and tracheal fluid cells of congenital diaphragmatic hernia fetuses,
 recapitulating some features of the disease. AF organoids are derived in
 a timeline compatible with prenatal intervention, potentially allowing
 investigation of therapeutic tools and regenerative medicine strategies
 personalized to the fetus at clinically relevant developmental stages.

Although prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies adopts sophis- transfusion syndrome (TTTS)5 and myelomeningocele (MMC)6. For
ticated genetic and imaging analyses1,2, prediction of severity remains other conditions, such as lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO)7,
challenging, limiting patient-specific parental counseling. Patient strat- where vesico-amniotic shunting is technically possible, appropriate
ification for prenatal therapy has shown level 1 evidence for improved patient selection remains a hurdle. The lack of autologous models
