For each patient, the only germline reference available was healthy colorectal tissue more than 5 cm from the tumour, consisting of epithelial and connective tissue. In order to allow the discovery of somatic mutations in this tissue we ran CaVEMan using an unmatched normal reference.

Phylogenies were then reconstructed for each bootstrap replicate by maximum parsimony using the Mix programme using the Wagner method, with the fake outgroup as a root.
