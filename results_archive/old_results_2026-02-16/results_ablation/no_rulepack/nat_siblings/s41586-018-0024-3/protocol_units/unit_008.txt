Single‑base somatic substitutions were identified using CaVEMan. For each patient, the only germline reference available was healthy colorectal tissue more than 5 cm from the tumour, consisting of epithelial and connective tissue. In order to allow the discovery of somatic mutations in this tissue we ran CaVEMan using an unmatched normal reference. Germline SNPs were removed by comparison to a panel of 75 unrelated normal samples.
