Drug dilutions were performed in two series: 1) stepwise 2‑fold dilutions from 20 µM to 19.5 nM; and 2) stepwise 2‑fold dilutions from 15 µM to 29.3 nM. All drugs were dispensed by a HP‑D300 automated liquid dispenser (TECAN). Samples were incubated for 6 days at 37 °C and cell viability was measured by CellTiter‑Glo 3D kit (Promega) on a SpectraMax M5e (Molecular Devices).
