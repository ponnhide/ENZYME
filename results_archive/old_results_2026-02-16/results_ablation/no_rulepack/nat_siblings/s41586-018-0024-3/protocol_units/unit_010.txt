Phylogenies were constructed using the Phylip suite of tools. The programme seqboot was used to generate 100 bootstrap replicates of each dataset by resampling the mutations with replacement. Phylogenies were then reconstructed for each bootstrap replicate by maximum parsimony using the Mix programme using the Wagner method, with the fake outgroup as a root. The programme Consense was used to build a consensus of all the trees that had been built for each patient, using the majority rule (extended) option.
