By integrating scRNA‑seq and Visium data (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 4c), we define specific spatial coordinates for these SOX9 subsets: (1) noncycling SOX9+LGR5+ cells are enriched in the surface epithelium; (2) noncycling SOX9+LGR5− cells are located in the basal glands; and (3) cycling SOX9+ cells map to glands in the regenerating superficial layer.
