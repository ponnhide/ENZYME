We first analysed cell composition and structed a force-directed k-nearest neighbour graph17 based on pseureconstructed differentiation trajectories over the entire course of docells to visualize the temporal progression (Fig. 1b).

Field-specific reporting
Please select the one below that is the best fit for your research. If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before making your selection.
 Life sciences Behavioural & social sciences Ecological, evolutionary & environmental sciences
For a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdf


Life sciences study design
All studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.
 Sample size Samples are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
 For determining the number of lines in DE analysis between human, chimp and macaque, see Extended Figure 8. For determining the number
 of cells to be sequenced per organoid and species, our project is the most extensive analysis thus far; based on Camp et al. (PNAS, 2015),
 Quadrato et al. (Nature, 2017) and Pollen et al. (Cell, 2019), we believe that we sufficiently sample the heterogeneity with the number of cells
 sequenced.

 Data exclusions We excluded low quality cells using criteria as described in the Methods. Besides that, no data were excluded.

 Replication We analyzed multiple organoids from multiple cell lines to determine the reproducibility of gene expression patterns across organoids and cell
 lines. We analyzed multiple organoids for different time points. We analyzed multiple individuals per species for the adult brain data.

 Randomization We try to mitigate any batch effects by analyzing organoids from multiple batches for a given line. In a set of experiments, we also multiplexed
 different cell lines from different species or different human individuals. We pooled tissue material from multiple individuals from different
 species for the adult brain data to reduce batch effects.

 Blinding Investigators were not blinded during data acquisition.
