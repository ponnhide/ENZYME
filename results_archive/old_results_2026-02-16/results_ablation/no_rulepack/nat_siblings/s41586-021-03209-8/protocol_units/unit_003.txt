Single‑cell RNA‑seq libraries were generated using the 10X Genomics Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Kit. In brief, single cells were loaded onto chromium chips with a capture target of 10,000 cells per sample. Libraries were prepared following the provided protocol and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq with a targeted sequencing depth of 50,000 reads per cell.
