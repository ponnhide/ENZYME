Nuclei were prepared as outlined in the 10X Genomics single‑cell ATAC‑seq solution protocol (v1.0 kit was used). Nuclei were loaded with a capture target of 10,000 nuclei per sample. scATAC‑seq libraries were prepared for sequencing following the 10X Genomics single‑cell ATAC‑seq solution protocol. Sequenced using PE150 on an Illumina NovaSeq with a target depth of 25,000 reads per nucleus.
