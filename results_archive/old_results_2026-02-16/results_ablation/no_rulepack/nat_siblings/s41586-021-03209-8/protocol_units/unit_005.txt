Fifty thousand cell aliquots were reconstituted in 200 μl CUT&Tag wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Nuclei were isolated by resuspending cell pellets in 200 μl dig‑wash buffer and washed twice in 200 μl dig‑wash buffer before resuspension in 100 μl dig‑wash buffer supplemented with 2 mM EDTA and a 1:50 dilution of H3K27ac primary antibody (Cell Signaling 8173), and incubated overnight at 4 °C on an overhead rotary shaker rotating at 90 rpm. After washing, pA‑Tn5 was added at a dilution of 1:100 in 100 μl dig‑med buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA was purified with a 1.5:1 ratio of AMPure XP beads, eluted in 21 μl buffer EB, and libraries were amplified with 12 cycles of PCR (98 °C 10 s, 63 °C 30 s, 72 °C 1 min) before purification and sequencing.
