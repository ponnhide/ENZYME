At day 35, organoids from each line were split into three different conditions: 1) normal medium conditions for day 35 and beyond as described above (with vitamin A); 2) normal medium conditions for day 35 and beyond (with vitamin A) plus 100 μM DEAB, an inhibitor of RA synthesis; or 3) normal medium conditions for day 35 and beyond as described above using B27 without vitamin A. DEAB treatment was ended after one week, and culture conditions remained the same until day 70, at which time organoids were processed for scRNA‑seq and immunohistochemistry.
