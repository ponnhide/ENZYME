Samples used for immunostaining were fixed in 4% PFA for 45 min, washed out with PBS, and incubated overnight in a 30% sucrose solution at 4 °C. Samples were then embedded in a 1:1 solution of OCT and sucrose and frozen at −80 °C until ready for sectioning. Cryosections were prepared at a thickness of 16 μm. Heat‑induced antigen retrieval was performed in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for 15 min. Permeabilization was performed in PBS (pH 7.4) supplemented with 2% Triton X‑100. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted and incubated in PBS (pH 7.4) supplemented with 10% donkey serum, 2% Triton X‑100, 0.2% gelatin.
