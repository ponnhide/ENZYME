For irradiation studies, the plates were placed on the centre of the rotating table of the (137Cs) gamma irradiator) for the time periods equivalent to either 6 Gy or 12 Gy, and then the organoids were further cultured in the incubator. For DSS treatment, DSS (MP Biomedicals) was dissolved in organoid media (without EGF or Nicotinamide), and added to organoid wells overnight for 16 h, after which organoids were washed twice with Advanced DMEM/F12 and then replaced with organoid media.
