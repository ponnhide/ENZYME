For passaging, organoids were mechanically dislodged from Cultrex domes using a P1000 pipette tip and resuspended in cold 10 mM EDTA with 10 µM Y‑27632 (STEMCELL Technologies) in a 15 mL conical tube. The tube containing organoids was then placed on an end‑over‑end rotator at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g, 4 °C. Organoids were then resuspended in 1X Trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and placed in an end‑over‑end rotator for 6 min at 37 °C. Following dissociation, Trypsin was neutralized with DMEM containing 10% FBS, and organoids were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g, 4 °C.
