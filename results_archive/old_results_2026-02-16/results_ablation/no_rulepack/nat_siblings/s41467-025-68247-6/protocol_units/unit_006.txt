FITC‑dextran (MedChemExpress) diluted to 2 mg/mL in PBS for 5 min in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 30 min, after which organoids were incubated in a solution of 4 kDa FITC‑Dextran in 30 µL droplets in 6‑well plates. The plates were placed upside down in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 30 min, after which organoids were imaged on a Nikon spinning disc confocal to collect fluorescence and DIC images, and the percentage of intact organoids was calculated as the number of organoids per condition/donor that excluded FITC‑dextran from the lumen divided by the total number of organoids.
