For experiments involving hashing, cells were demultiplexed using the HTODemux function in Seurat. Organoids were resuspended in 100 µL cell staining buffer (2% BSA, 0.01% Tween in PBS) and 1 µL of a unique cell hashing antibody (TotalSeqA: BioLegend) was added per condition for 20 min on ice, then cells were pipette mixed 60 times. Organoids were then washed three times with PBS and resuspended in organoid wash buffer (0.1% Triton X‑100, 0.2% BSA) overnight at 4 °C on a rocker.
