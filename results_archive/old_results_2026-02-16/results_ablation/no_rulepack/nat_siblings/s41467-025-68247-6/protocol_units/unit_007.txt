Organoids were incubated in CellEvent Caspase‑3/7 Detection Reagent (Thermo Fisher) diluted in media according to manufacturer protocols for 30 min, washed with PBS, and imaged on a Nikon spinning disc confocal to collect fluorescence and DIC images. The % area of caspase‑3/7 positive staining was quantified using FIJI as the area of organoid stained positive for Caspase‑3/7 divided by the total area of the organoid from DIC images.
