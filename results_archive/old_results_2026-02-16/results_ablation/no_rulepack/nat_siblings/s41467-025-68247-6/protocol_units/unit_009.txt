For scRNA‑seq experiments, organoids were dissociated using the Neural Dissociation‑P kit (Miltenyi). Organoids were pipetted out of their microwell plates and into a deep‑well 96‑well plate (Thermo Fisher) for dissociation. Enzyme mix 1 was prepared according to manufacturer protocols with the addition of Y‑27632 for a final volume containing human recombinant proteins, and organoids were placed at 10 °C for 10 min, after which enzyme mix 2 was added. Organoids were kept at 10 °C throughout dissociation for up to 60 min, and were removed every 10 min to be pipette mixed with a P1000 pipette to aid in disassociation. Once dissociation was complete, organoids were centrifuged for 3 min, 500 × g, 4 °C and washed twice with PBS.
