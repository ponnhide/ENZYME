For immunofluorescence staining, cryosections were blocked in 10% normal donkey serum (MilliporeSigma, catalogue no. S30-M) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (MilliporeSigma, catalogue no. T9284-100ML) diluted in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 10% NDS and 0.3% Triton X-100.
