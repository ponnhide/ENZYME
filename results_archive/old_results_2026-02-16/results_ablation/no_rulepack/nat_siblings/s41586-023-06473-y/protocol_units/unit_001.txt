The CHOOSE lentiviral vector was constructed based on a previously published lentiviral vector that carries a CAG driving ERT2-Cre-ERT2-P2A-EGFP-P2A-puro cassette12. A multicloning site including NheI and SgsI recognition sequences was introduced to the 3′ LTR of the lentivirus backbone according to the CROP-seq vector design17. Then, the original U6 sgRNA expression cassette was removed; instead, the dual sgRNA (U6-sgRNA1-H1-sgRNA2) cassette was introduced to the 3′ LTR cloning site. To generate a barcoded library, the following primers were used to individually amplify (8–10 cycles, monitored using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) machine, stopped when reaching logarithmic phase) each dual sgRNA cassette from the lentiviral construct used in the reporter assay while introducing a 15 base pair barcode.
