For ventralized organoids, we followed a previously published protocol47. Embryoid bodies were not embedded, and patterning factors, including 100 nM SAG (Merck-Millipore, catalogue no. US1566660) and 2.5 μM IWP2 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. IO536), were added from day 5 to day 11. medium was switched to improved differentiation medium supplemented with B27 minus vitamin A (IDM-A) at day 14. On day 25, medium was switched to improved differentiation medium supplemented with B27 plus vitamin A (IDM+A); 1% Matrigel was added to the medium from day 40 to day 90. From day 60 to day 70, medium was gradually switched to Brainphys medium (Stemcell Technologies, catalogue no. 05790) and supplemented with BDNF, GDNF and bucladesine sodium as described above.
