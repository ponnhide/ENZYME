      "text": "The CHOOSE lentiviral vector was constructed based on a previously published lentiviral vector that carries a CAG driving ERT2-Cre-ERT2-P2A-EGFP-P2A-puro cassette12. A multicloning site including NheI and SgsI recognition sequences was introduced to the 3′ LTR of the lentivirus backbone according to the CROP-seq vector design17. Then, the original U6 sgRNA expression cassette was removed; instead, the dual sgRNA (U6-sgRNA1-H1-sgRNA2) cassette was introduced to the 3′ LTR cloning site. To generate a barcoded library, the following primers were used to individually amplify (8–10 cycles, monitored using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) machine, stopped when reaching logarithmic phase) each dual sgRNA cassette from the lentiviral construct used in the reporter assay while introducing a 15 base pair barcode.",

In brief, cells were cultured to 70–80% confluent, and 16,000 live cells in 150 μl Essential8 medium supplemented with Revitacell (ThermoFisher, catalogue no. A2644501) were added to each well of a U-bottom ultralow attachment 96-well plate (Corning, catalogue no. CLS3473) to form embryoid bodies. For eCas9 induction, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. H7904) was added on day 5 at a concentration of 0.3 μg ml−1. Neural induction was started on day 6. Embryoid bodies were embedded in Matrigel (Corning, catalogue no. 3524234) at day 11 or 12 based on morphology check. CHIR99021 (Merck, catalogue no. 361571) at 3 μM was added from day 13 to day 16, and medium was switched to improved differentiation medium supplemented with B27 minus vitamin A (IDM-A) at day 14. On day 25, medium was switched to improved differentiation medium supplemented with B27 plus vitamin A (IDM+A); 1% Matrigel was added to the medium from day 40 to day 90. From day 60 to day 70, medium was gradually switched to Brainphys medium (Stemcell Technologies, catalogue no. 05790) and supplemented with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (20 ng ml−1; Stemcell Technologies, catalogue no. 78005.3), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (20 mg ml−1; Stemcell Technologies, catalogue no. 78005.3) and bucladesine sodium (1 mM; MedChemExpress, catalogue no.
