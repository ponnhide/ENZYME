Cerebral organoids were generated using a previously published protocol with modifications23. In brief, cells were cultured to 70–80% confluent, and 16,000 live cells in 150 μl Essential8 medium supplemented with Revitacell (ThermoFisher, catalogue no. A2644501) were added to each well of a U-bottom ultralow attachment 96-well plate (Corning, catalogue no. CLS3473) to form embryoid bodies. For eCas9 induction, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. H7904) was added on day 5 at a concentration of 0.3 μg ml−1. Neural induction was started on day 6. Embryoid bodies were embedded in Matrigel (Corning, catalogue no. 3524234) at day 11 or 12 based on morphology check. CHIR99021 (Merck, catalogue no. 361571) at 3 μM was added from day 13 to day 16, and medium was switched to improved differentiation medium supplemented with B27 minus vitamin A (IDM-A) at day 14. On day 25, medium was switched to improved differentiation medium supplemented with B27 plus vitamin A (IDM+A); 1% Matrigel was added to the medium from day 40 to day 90. From day 60 to day 70, medium was gradually switched to Brainphys medium (Stemcell Technologies, catalogue no. 05790) and supplemented with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (20 ng ml−1; Stemcell Technologies, catalogue no. 78005.3), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (20 mg ml−1; Stemcell Technologies, catalogue no. 78005.3) and bucladesine sodium (1 mM; MedChemExpress, catalogue no. EL0011) and cleaned up by phenol-chloroform extraction.
