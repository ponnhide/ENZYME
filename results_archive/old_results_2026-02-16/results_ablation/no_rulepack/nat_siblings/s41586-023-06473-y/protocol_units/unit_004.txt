sgRNA selection and cloning. The top four sgRNAs were first selected on the basis of predictions using multilayered Vienna Bioactivity CRISPR (VBC) score54 and then subjected to the reporter assay (below) to test editing efficiency. sgRNAs were cloned into the gRNA reporter lentivirus construct (containing the dual sgRNA cassette: U6-sgRNA1-H1-sgRNA2) using the GeCKO cloning protocol55.
