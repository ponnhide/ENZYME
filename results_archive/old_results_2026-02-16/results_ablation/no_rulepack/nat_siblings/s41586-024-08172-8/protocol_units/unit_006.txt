We normalized the raw read counts for all Smart‑seq2 data by dividing it by the maximum gene length for each gene obtained from BioMart. We next multiplied these normalized read counts by the median gene length across all genes and treated those length‑normalized counts equivalently to raw counts from the datasets obtained with the help of unique molecular identifiers in our downstream analyses.
