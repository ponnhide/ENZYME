To infer a global ordering of differentiation state, we sought to infer a real‑time‑informed pseudotime on the basis of neural optimal transport47 in the scPoli latent space. We first grouped organoid age in days into seven bins ((0, 15], (15, 30], (30,60], (60, 90], (90, 120], (120, 150], (150, 450]). Next, we used moscot48 to solve a temporal neural optimal transport problem. The optimal transport problem was solved using the following parameters: iterations = 25,000, compute_wasserstein_baseline = False, batch_size = 1,024, patience = 100, pretrain = True, train_size = 1.
