Organoids were dissociated into single cells with TrypLE (Gibco) at 37 °C for 10 minutes. The resulting single‑cell suspension was passed through a 40 µm cell strainer (Falcon) to remove any remaining cell aggregates. A cell counter (Countstar) was used for quality control. Single‑cell RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the 10x Genomics Chromium 3’ Gene Expression solution v3.1 following the manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 (Illumina).
