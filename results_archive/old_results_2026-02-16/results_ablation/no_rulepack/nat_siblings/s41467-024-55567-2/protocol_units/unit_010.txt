Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (TransGen Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Up to 1 µg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using the NovoScriptPlus Reverse Transcriptase kit (NovoProtein). qPCR was performed using the ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme) on a CFX384 Real‑Time System (BioRad). Relative gene expression levels were calculated using the ΔΔCt method.
