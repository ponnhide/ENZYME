Organoids were induced to differentiate by directly changing the culture media to differentiation media. Paneth cells: EGF (50 ng/mL), IGF‑I (100 ng/mL), FGF‑2 (50 ng/mL), DMH1 (2 µM), R‑spondin1 CM (10%), Gastrin I (10 nM), A83‑01 (0.5 µM), CHIR (4 µM), DAPT (10 µM) for 2 days and then replace CHIR with IWR‑1 (2 µM) for 3 days.
