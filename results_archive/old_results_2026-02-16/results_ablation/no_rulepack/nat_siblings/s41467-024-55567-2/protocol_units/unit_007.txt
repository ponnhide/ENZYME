To assess colony‑forming efficiency, organoids were dissociated into single cells and replated at a density of 8000 cells/well BME in 48‑well plates. After 7 days, colonies were fixed, stained with DAPI, and counted manually. Colony‑forming efficiency = number of colonies/number of plated cells × 100%.
