Tissues were transferred into Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and placed on ice until processing. The tissues were treated with 2.5 mM EDTA at 4 °C for 40 minutes to release crypts. The supernatant containing crypts was collected and embedded in Cultrex RGF BME (R&D Systems) droplets in 48‑well plates (~50 crypts/well). After solidiﬁcation, droplets were overlaid with culture medium containing 10 µM Y‑27632 (TargetMol).
