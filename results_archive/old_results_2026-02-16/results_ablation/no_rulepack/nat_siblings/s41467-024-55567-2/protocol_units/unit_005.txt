Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described22. Briefly, organoids were released from BME with DPBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sangon Biotech) for 30 minutes at room temperature, and permeabilized in DPBS containing 0.5% Triton X‑100. Samples were blocked and incubated in blocking buffer (0.1% BSA, 0.5% Tween 20 in DPBS) containing primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Samples were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:1000, Invitrogen) for 1 hour at room temperature, counterstained with DAPI, and images were taken.
