Six-well plates (Appleton Woods, Corning, CC010) were coated with 1% Geltrex (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1413302) in DMEM/F-12 (Fisher Scientific, Gibco, 11514436). hiPSCs were seeded at a density of 1 × 10^5 cells per well. After 24 h, the survival assay was performed in IncuCyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis system (Sartorius, 4647) with topotecan (1.25 nM, 2.5 nM, 5 nM or 10 nM) added and images acquired every 6 h.
