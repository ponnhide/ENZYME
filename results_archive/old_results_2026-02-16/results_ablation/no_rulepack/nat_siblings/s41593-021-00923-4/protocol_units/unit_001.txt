For the generation of hiPSC-derived COs cultured at the ALI, we modified a previously published method utilizing a STEMdiff Cerebral Organoid kit (StemCell Technologies, 08570). Briefly, 18,000 cells were plated in the presence of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer microfilaments to achieve improved cortical development58.
