Organoids were dissociated and DNA was isolated using the QiaSymphony DSP DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen; 937236). Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq DNA Nano Library Prep Kit (20015964). Paired-end sequencing of the generated libraries with 2 × 150 bp on the Illumina HiSeq X Ten sequencing system at 30× coverage.
