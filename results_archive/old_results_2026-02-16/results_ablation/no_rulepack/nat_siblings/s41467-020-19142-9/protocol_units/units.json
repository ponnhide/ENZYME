The organoid lines used in this study were derived from biopsies (provided by Departments of Surgery and Pathology of the Diakonessenhuis hospital, Utrecht, The Netherlands) of a CRC and adjacent healthy colon mucosal epithelium taken from colon tissue resected during a left hemicolectomy to remove a CRC from a female patient (71 years of age). Tissue collection was approved by the medical ethical committee (METC) of the Diakonessenhuis hospital, in agreement with the declaration of Helsinki and according to Dutch and European Union legislation. The samples were collected under METC protocol 12/093 HUB-Cancer following written informed consent at the Diakonessenhuis hospital Utrecht.",

Subsequently, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 1 h at 18,000 g at 15 °C. Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay. For each sample, 20 µg of total protein was reduced, alkylated, and digested sequentially with Lys‑C (1:100) and trypsin (1:75). For high‑pH reversed‑phase fractionation, peptide digests were loaded on C18 STAGE‑tips in 200 mM ammonium formate at pH 10 and eluted into 5 fractions with 11–80% acetonitrile.",
