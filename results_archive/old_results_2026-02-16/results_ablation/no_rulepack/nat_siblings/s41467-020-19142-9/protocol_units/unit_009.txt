On the day of harvest, organoids were removed from the 6-well culture plates using a P1000 pipette and spun down for 8 min at 500 g with the brakes off. Cell pellets were then incubated with Cell Recovery Solution (Roche Diagnostics) for 30 min on ice to remove excess BME. Cells liberated from BME were then washed three times in excess PBS to remove any residual BME. After the last wash, all PBS was removed and the tube opening was quickly dried using a paper towel. Cell pellets were snap frozen in dry ice and stored at −80 °C.
