Organoids were lysed by gentle vortexing in 8 M Urea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate supplemented with 50 µg/ml DNAse I (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 µg/ml RNAse A (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1× complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Subsequently, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 1 h at 18,000 g at 15 °C. Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay. For each sample, 20 µg of total protein was reduced, alkylated, and digested sequentially with Lys‑C (1:100) and trypsin (1:75). For high‑pH reversed‑phase fractionation, peptide digests were loaded on C18 STAGE‑tips in 200 mM ammonium formate at pH 10 and eluted into 5 fractions with 11–80% acetonitrile.
