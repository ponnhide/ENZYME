Colonic crypts were subsequently plated in basement membrane extract (BME; Cultrex PC BME RGF type 2, Amsbio). Organoids were grown in human intestinal stem cell medium (HISCM), which is composed of Advanced Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium/F12 supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES and Glutamax (all Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 50% Wnt3a conditioned medium (in-house), 20% R-Spondin1 conditioned medium (in-house), 10% Noggin conditioned medium (in-house), 1x B27, 1.25mM N-acetylcysteine, 10 mM nicotinamide, 50 ng/ml human EGF, 10 nM Gastrin, 500 nM A83-01, 3 µM SB202190, 10 nM prostaglandin E2 and 100 µg/ml Primocin (Invivogen).
