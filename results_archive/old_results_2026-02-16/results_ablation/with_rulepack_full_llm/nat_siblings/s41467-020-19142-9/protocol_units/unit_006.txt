To generate clonal tumor organoid lines, early passage tumor organoids were dissociated into single cells by TryPLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific), washed and suspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 2 mM EDTA and 5% FCS). Prior to FACS purification, DAPI was added to the FACS buffer. HLA-A2+ single cells were sorted into separate wells of 96-well plates containing 100 µl HISCM with 10 µM LY27632 and coated with BME.
