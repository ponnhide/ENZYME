The top four sgRNAs were first selected on the basis of predictions using multilayered Vienna Bioac‑tivity CRISPR (VBC) score54 and then subjected to the reporter assay to test editing efficiency. sgRNAs were cloned into the reporter assay lentivirus construct (containing the dual sgRNA cassette: U6‑sgRNA1‑H1‑sgRNA2) using the GeCKO cloning protocol55.
