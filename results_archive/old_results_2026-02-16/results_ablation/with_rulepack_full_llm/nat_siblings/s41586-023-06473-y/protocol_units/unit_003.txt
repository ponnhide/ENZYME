Cerebral organoids were generated using a previously published protocol with modifications23. In brief, cells were cultured to 70–80% confluence, and 16,000 live cells in 150 μl Essential8 medium supplemented with Revitacell (ThermoFisher, catalogue no. A2644501) were added to each well of a U-bottom ultralow attachment 96-well plate (Corning, catalogue no. CLS3473) to form embryoid bodies.
