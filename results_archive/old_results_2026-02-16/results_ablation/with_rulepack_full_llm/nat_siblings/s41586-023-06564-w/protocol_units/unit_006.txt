For real‑time qPCR analysis, 2–3 organoids were pooled as a sample. mRNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Plus kit (Qiagen, catalogue no. 74136) and template complementary DNA was prepared by reverse transcription using the SuperScript III First‑Strand Synthesis SuperMix. Real‑time qPCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. 4312704) on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real‑Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. 4366076).
