The interneuron migration CRISPR sgRNA library was designed by selecting up to five sgRNAs targeting each of the 438 genes of interest (425 NDD genes and 13 genes associated with interneuron development) and an extra 10% ‘safe‑harbour‑targeting’ negative control sgRNAs (Supplementary Table 2). Cloning restriction sites and amplification primer handles were appended to each oligo. The sgRNA library oligos were synthesized on the Agilent chip oligo array synthesis platform and cloned into a lentiviral plasmid vector that constitutively expresses the sgRNA and mCherry.
