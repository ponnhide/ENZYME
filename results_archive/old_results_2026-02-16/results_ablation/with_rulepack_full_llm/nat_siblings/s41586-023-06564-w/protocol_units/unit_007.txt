To generate SMAD4 HET lines in the 1205‑4 genetic background, 0.5 million cells were mixed with 40 pmol of sgRNA (AAAAAGAGCAAUUGAAAGUU) and 5 µg of Cas9 protein (Alt‑R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for roughly 18 h. After washing with PBS (2 h × 3, 37 °C), samples were incubated in a nuclear staining solution (1:150 dilution of RedDot Biotium 40061‑T) in PBS with 500 mM NaCl at 37 °C overnight.
