hCO and hSO were dissociated as previously described57 with some modifications. Briefly, organoids were incubated with an enzyme solution containing 10 U ml−1 papain (Worthington, catalogue no. LS003127), 0.36% d(+)-glucose, 26 mM NaHCO3, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1× Earle’s balanced salt solution, 0.2% trypsin inhibitor (Worthington, catalogue no. LS003086) for 15 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2.
