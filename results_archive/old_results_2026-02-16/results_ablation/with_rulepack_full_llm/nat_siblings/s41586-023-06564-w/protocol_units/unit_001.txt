The CAG::Cas9 line was generated as previously described53. (2 × 10^6 cells) dissociated with accutase (Innovative Cell Technology) were electroporated using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-NucleofectorTMX Kit L (Lonza, catalogue no. V4XP-3024), a 4D-nucleofector core unit and X unit (Lonza; nucleofection program no. CA-137). Once the seeded cells reached 70–80% confluency, 1 µg ml−1 puromycin in StemFlex medium (Life Technologies, catalogue no. A3349401) was supplemented for 5 days. Colonies were visible at the end of 5 days of selection in puromycin. Cells were maintained in StemFlex medium for another 5 days, and individual colonies were picked.
