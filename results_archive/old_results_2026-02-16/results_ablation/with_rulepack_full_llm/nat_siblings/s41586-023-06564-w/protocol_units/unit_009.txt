To image the Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cell migration, hFA were transferred to a well of a 96‑well plate with a clear bottom (ibidi, catalogue no. 89626) in 500 µl of neural medium under environmentally controlled conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2). Samples were placed in this condition for 30–60 min, then imaged under a ×10 objective at a depth of 50–150 µm at a rate of roughly 20 min per frame for 18–22 h.
