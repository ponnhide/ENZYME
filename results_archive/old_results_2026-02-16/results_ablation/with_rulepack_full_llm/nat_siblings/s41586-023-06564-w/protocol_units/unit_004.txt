To generate 3D hCO, hiPS cells were dissociated with accutase to obtain a single‑cell suspension. About 3 × 10^6 cells were seeded per AggreWell 800 plate well in Essential 8 medium supplemented with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (10 µM). The plate was centrifuged at 100 g for 3 min and incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The next day (day 0), cellular aggregates were transferred into ultra‑low attachment plastic dishes (Corning, catalogue no. 3262) and cultured in E6 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. A1516401) supplemented with dorsomorphin (2.5 µM), SB‑431542 (10 µM) and XAV‑939 (1.25 µM).
