 however, this has proven difﬁcult in homogeneous cultures devoid of in vivo
 spatial niche gradients for adult stem cell-derived organoids. In this study, we
 leverage a combination of small molecule pathway modulators to enhance the
 stemness of organoid stem cells, thereby amplifying their differentiation
 potential and subsequently increasing cellular diversity within human intest-
 inal organoids without the need for artiﬁcial spatial or temporal signaling
 gradients. Moreover, we demonstrate that this balance between self-renewal
 and differentiation can be effectively and reversibly shifted from secretory cell
 differentiation to the enterocyte lineage with enhanced proliferation using
 BET inhibitors, or unidirectional differentiation towards speciﬁc intestinal cell
 types by manipulating in vivo niche signals such as Wnt, Notch, and BMP. As a
 result, we establish an optimized human small intestinal organoid (hSIO) sys-
 tem characterized by high proliferative capacity and increased cell diversity
 under a single culture condition. This optimization facilitates the scalability
 and utility of the organoid system in high-throughput applications.
