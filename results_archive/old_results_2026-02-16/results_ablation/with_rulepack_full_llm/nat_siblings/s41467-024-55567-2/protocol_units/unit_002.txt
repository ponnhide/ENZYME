For the construction of a fluorescent reporter, an LGR5-mNeonGreen knock-in reporter was introduced into the last exon of LGR5 via electroporation, using previously published sgRNA (Sup- ...). Two LGR5-targeting sgRNAs were cloned into SpCas9-equipped HP180 plasmids (a gift from Hui Yang lab), generating LGR5 sgRNA plasmids. HDR templates were made by replacing the CMV promoter in pBluescript II SK (+) (Addgene, #212205) with LGR5-P2AmNeonGreen sequence flanked by LGR5 homology arms using the Fast-Fusion™ Cloning Kit (GeneCopoeia). The LGR5 sgRNA plasmids and HDR template were co-electroporated into human intestinal organoids using a NEPA21 electroporator (Nepa Gene) following published methods45.
