Organoids were induced to differentiate by directly changing the culture media to differentiation media. The differentiation protocols are as follows: Paneth cells. EGF (50 ng/mL), IGF-I (100 ng/mL), FGF-2 (50 ng/mL), DMH1 (2 μM), R-spondin1 CM (10%), Gastrin I (10 nM), A83-01 (0.5 μM), CHIR (4 μM), DAPT (10 μM), pVc (100 μg/mL) and IL-22 (2 ng/mL). Goblet cells. SJ000291942 (10 μM), R-spondin1 CM (10%), Gastrin I (10 nM), A83-01 (0.5 μM), CHIR (4 μM) and DAPT (10 μM) for 2 days and then replace CHIR with IWR-1 (2 μM) for 3 days. Enteroendocrine cells. DMH1 (2 μM), R-spondin1 CM (10%), Gastrin I (10 nM), A83-01 (0.5 μM), CHIR (4 μM), DAPT (10 μM) and CP673451 (0.5 μM) for 2 days, and then DMH1 (2 μM), Gastrin I (10 nM), A83-01 (0.5 μM), DAPT (10 μM), CP673451 (0.5 μM) and Gefitinib (5 μM) for 3 days.
