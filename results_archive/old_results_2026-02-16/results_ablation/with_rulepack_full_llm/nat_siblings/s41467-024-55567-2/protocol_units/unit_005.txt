Immunostaining organoids were released from BME with DPBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sangon Biotech) for 30 minutes at room temperature, and permeabilized in DPBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Samples were blocked and incubated in blocking buffer (0.1% BSA, 0.5% Tween 20 in DPBS) containing primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: rabbit anti-Lysozyme (1:500, Invitrogen), mouse anti-Mucin 2 (1:100, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-α-defensin 5 (1:100, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-OLFM4 (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology), rat anti-Somatostatin (1:200, Millipore), mouse anti-Glucagon (1:200, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-ALPI (1:50, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-GP2 (1:500, MBL), rabbit anti-E-cadherin (1:500, Proteintech). Samples were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:1000, Invitrogen) for 1 hour at room temperature, counterstained with DAPI and imaged.
