We developed a computational approach to reconstruct organoid laminar structure dynamics from multiplexed imaging data. This method (termed multi-plexed tissue units (MTUs))22, nuclei segmentation (~330,000 nuclei) (Laminator) establishes a contour around the organoid; segments and orients adjacent laminar windows circumference-spanning each organoid; quantifies signals across laminar windows; analyzes laminar window heterogeneity; and applies graph embedding and diffusion analysis for trajectory reconstruction (Fig. 2a).
