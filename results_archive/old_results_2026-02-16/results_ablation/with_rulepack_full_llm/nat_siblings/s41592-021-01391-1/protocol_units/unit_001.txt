Single LGR5+ intestinal stem cells were isolated via FACS and precultured for 3 days under stem cell maintenance conditions (day 0 seeding, ENR CV days 0–3). On day 3, CV was removed from the culture, and organoids differentiated under ENR conditions for up to 3 days. For each day during development (S0–S3), individual organoids were isolated, dissociated and processed on the DisCo platform.
