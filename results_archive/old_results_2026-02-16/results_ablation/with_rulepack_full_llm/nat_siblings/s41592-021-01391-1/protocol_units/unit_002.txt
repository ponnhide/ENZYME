The PDMS‑based primary replica mold was then silanized and subsequently used to obtain secondary replica molds for PDMS flow layer production. The PDMS and curing agent at a ratio of 5:1, degassed for 15 min, and cured for 60 min at 80 °C. The flow layer was fabricated using PDMS and curing agent at a ratio of 20:1, degassed for 15 min, and cured for 60 min at 80 °C. The control layer was fabricated by spin coating the SU8 photoresist layer at 650 r.p.m. for 35 s with a 15 s ramp time, followed by baking at 80 °C for 30 min. Holes were punched with a 0.5 mm diameter biopsy punch. The two PDMS layers were manually aligned and bonded at 80 °C for at least 60 min.
