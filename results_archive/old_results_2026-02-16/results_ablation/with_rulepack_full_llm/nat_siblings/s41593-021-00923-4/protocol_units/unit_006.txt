DNA damage detection. DNA damage accumulation was assessed by DNA immunolabeling for γ-H2AX or 53BP1 (refs. 43,65). hiPSCs were seeded overnight on coverslips (Academy, NPC16/13) coated with 1% Geltrex (ThermoFisher Scientific, A1413302; diluted in DMEM/F-12, Fisher Scientific, Gibco, 11514436). Coverslips were washed with PBS containing 0.1 % Tween-20 (PBST) and were fixed with 2% PFA (w/v; Alfa Aesar, 43368) for 10 min. After washing, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, T8787) for 10 min, blocked with 5% BSA (w/v; Sigma, A9647) for 1 h, incubated with primary antibody in 5% BSA PBST overnight at 4 °C, followed by secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and finally mounted for imaging.
