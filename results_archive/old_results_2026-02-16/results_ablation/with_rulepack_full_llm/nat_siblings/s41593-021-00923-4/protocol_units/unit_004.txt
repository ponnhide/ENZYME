Alkaline comet assay. The alkaline comet assay was performed to compare DNA accumulation and repair in control and C9 ALS/FTD hiPSC lines60. Cells were seeded overnight before topotecan (10 μM for 1 h) treatment in the presence or absence of an ATMi (Selleck Chemicals, AZD0156, 30 nM). Half of the plates were trypsinized (0.25%, Sigma-Aldrich, T4049) for 1 h. The cells were then resuspended in 1× PBS (Mg/Ca-free) at 2 × 10^5 cells per ml, mixed in 500 μl LMAgarose (Trevigen, 4250-050-02; melted for 5 min at 100 °C and kept at 37 °C), then 70 μl of the mixture was pipetted on preheated 1% agarose-coated glass slides (37 °C). The slides were subjected to electrophoresis at 35 V for 10 min in the alkaline electrophoresis solution (200 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, pH > 13). After fixation with 70% ethanol and drying at 37 °C, slides were stained with SYBR green I (Invitrogen, D2650). Tail percentage was measured using the OpenComet plugin for ImageJ (>50 cells per condition).
