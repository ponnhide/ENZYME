MEA recordings. ALI-COs were secured with a platinum harp onto 3D MEAs (Multi Channel Systems, MEA2100, 60–3DMEA200/12iR-Ti-gr, 60 electrodes, 200-μm spacing). Six-minute-long recordings of spontaneous activity at 37 °C (n = 35 ALI-COs) were acquired and exported to Matlab (MathWorks) for analysis. The raw signal was bandpass-filtered (third-order Butterworth, 600–8,000 Hz) and spikes detected using a threshold of 3 standard deviations above background noise with a 1.5‑ms refractory period. Correlated activity between electrodes was analyzed using the spike‑time tiling coefficient (STTC) with a synchronicity window of 175 ms.
