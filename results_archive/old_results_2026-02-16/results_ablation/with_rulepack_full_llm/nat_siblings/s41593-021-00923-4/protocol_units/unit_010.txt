Statistics and reproducibility. The subject identifiers were blinded for the observers. Details of statistical tests and exact sample sizes are listed in Supplementary Table 3. Briefly, the sample sizes using hiPSC lines and organoids were estimated from previously performed experiments5,61. In total, 233 whole COs were used for this study, and 587 ALI‑CO slices were grown deriving from 99 independent whole organoids. At least three independent biological replicates were used per group for all statistical analyses in biological experiments. The GraphPad software (GraphPad Prism v.7.0/8.0) was used for distribution analysis, statistical analysis and for generating graphs. When normality was not assumed, non‑parametric tests were used. Overall analysis of variance (ANOVA) P value is presented; cases where no statistical difference was found between more than two groups, the overall ANOVA P value is presented.
