Real-time cell vulnerability assay. Six-well plates (Appleton Woods, Corning, CC010) were coated with 1% Geltrex (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1413302) in DMEM/F-12 (Fisher Scientific, Gibco, 11514436). hiPSCs were seeded in StemMACS iPS-Brew XF (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-104-368) medium at a density of 1 × 10^5 cells per well. After 24 h, the survival assay was performed in IncuCyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis system (Sartorius, 4647). Cells were either left untreated or treated daily with 1.25 nM, 2.5 nM, 5 nM or 10 nM topotecan (Apexbio, B2296). Images were acquired every 6 h over a duration of 5 days using a ×10 magnification objective and cell confluency was determined as a cell body cluster area by the IncuCyte NeuroTrack software.
