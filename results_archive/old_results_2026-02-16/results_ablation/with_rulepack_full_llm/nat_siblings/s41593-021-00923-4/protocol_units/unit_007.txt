Repeat-primed PCR. DNA was extracted from samples using a QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, 51306), and the C9ORF72 locus amplified by PCR with the 6-FAM-labeled forward and reverse primers (see below) as previously described69. Forward primer: MRX-F1: FAM-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTCAAGGAGGGAAACAACCGCAGCC; Reverse primer: MRX-R: CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCGGGCCCGCCCCGA. The PCR product was denatured and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on an Applied Bioscience 3730XL DNA Analyzer (Thermo), and chromatographs were aligned in GeneMapper v.6. software (Thermo).
