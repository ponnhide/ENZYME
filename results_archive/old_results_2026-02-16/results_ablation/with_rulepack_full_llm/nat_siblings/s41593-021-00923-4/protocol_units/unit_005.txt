Southern blotting. DNA was extracted from the hiPSC cultures using a Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (69506). DNA (5 µg) was restriction digested with Bsu36I (New England Biolabs, R0524S) and ran on 0.8% agarose gels accompanied by molecular weight markers II (Roche, 11218590910) and III (Roche, 11218603910). Southern blotting was performed according to published protocols68 using a 1-kb probe (Prepared by IDT; sequence: GGGGCC) in salmon sperm DNA for hybridization and an anti-DIG AP antibody (Roche, 11093274910) for visualization.
