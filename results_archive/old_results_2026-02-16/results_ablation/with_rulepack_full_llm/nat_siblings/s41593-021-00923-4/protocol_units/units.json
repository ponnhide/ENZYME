For the generation of hiPSC-derived COs cultured at the ALI, we modified a previously published method5 utilizing a STEMdiff Cerebral Organoid kit (StemCell Technologies, 08570). Briefly, 18,000 cells were plated in the presence of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer microfilaments to achieve improved cortical development58. Initially, media changes were performed at days 3, 5 and 7, then every 3–4 days. From 35 DIV onwards, Matrigel (Corning, 354234) was added in 1:50 dilution to achieve a polarized cortical plate formation. Between 50 and 80 DIV, 300-μm thick ALI-CO cultures were prepared for subsequent long-term cultures on Millicell-CM (Merck Millipore, PICM0RG50) inserts and were fed daily with slice medium containing neurobasal medium (ThermoFisher Scientific, 21103049) supplemented with 1× B27 supplement (ThermoFisher Scientific, 17504044), 0.45% (w/v) glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, G8769), Glutamax (ThermoFisher Scientific, 35050038) and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic.",
