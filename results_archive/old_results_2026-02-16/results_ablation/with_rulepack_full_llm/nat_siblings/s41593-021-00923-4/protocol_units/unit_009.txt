scRNA‑seq pipeline and analysis. The initial scRNA‑seq data‑analysis pipeline was generated using the CellRanger 3.1 software package according to our published protocols5. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 human genome. CellRanger detected 85% fraction reads on average per cell and 1,600–2,100 median genes per cell. Data were processed in Seurat 3.1/4.0.1 and filtered based on a minimum of three cells expressing each gene and a mitochondrial gene proportion below 25%. Clustering was performed in Seurat over 14 dimensions with a resolution of 0.4, yielding 233 whole COs and 587 ALI‑CO slices. Batch correction was applied using canonical correlation analysis, and trajectory reconstruction was performed with Monocle 3 (v.0.2.3.0).
