Immunocytochemistry. ALI-COs and whole organoids at 30 and 75 DIV were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 45 min, 2 or 4 h, respectively, washed slices at room temperature. Fixed samples were prepared as frozen blocks for cryostat sectioning, and 12-μm thick frozen sections were immunostained with antibodies (Supplementary Table 2) using our published protocols61. After immunofluorescence-based detection of DDR in hiPSCs, cells were seeded on 1% Geltrex-coated coverslips 24 h before treatment (Geltrex, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 0.5 mg ml−1) and then washed in PBS followed by fixation in 2% PFA (Alfa Aesar) for 15 min at room temperature, then washed again three times in PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, T8787) for 10 min, before blocking at room temperature for 1 h in 5% BSA (w/v; Sigma, A9647), followed by primary antibody (in 5% BSA PBST) incubation overnight at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with secondary antibody (in 5% BSA PBST) for 1 h at room temperature and were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 0.2 mg ml−1) and then mounted using Fluoromount-G (Affymetrix eBioscience, 15586276).
