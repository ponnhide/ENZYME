CUT&Tag libraries were prepared as previously described60, with modifications. In brief, cells were dissociated from human cortical tissue as described above. Fifty thousand cell aliquots were reconstituted in 200 μl CUT&Tag wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Nuclei were isolated by resuspending cell pellets in 200 μl dig-wash buffer and washed twice.
