Recombinant human laminin‑111 (BioLamina, #LN111) was added to the silk protein solution at a final concentration of 10 μg ml−1. The FN‑silk/LN‑111 mixture was incubated 10 min at RT before usage. About 10 µM Y‑27632 dihydrochloride was added. Air bubbles were introduced into the droplet by pipetting up and down (10–15 strokes), creating a dense foam. Multiple foams are generated in series with uniform shape and size (Supplementary Fig. 7b).",
