Single‑cell RNA sequencing, single‑cell suspensions were loaded onto 10x Genomics Single Cell 3′ Chips along with the mastermix as per the manufacturer’s instructions. From day 16 onward, 0.5 mM db‑cAMP and 1 μM DAPT were added to the culture emulsion (GEMs, version 3 chemistry). The resulting libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq500 or a NovaSeq 6000 with Read1 28 cycles, Read2 98 cycles, and Index1 8 cycles using a 200‑cycle kit.
