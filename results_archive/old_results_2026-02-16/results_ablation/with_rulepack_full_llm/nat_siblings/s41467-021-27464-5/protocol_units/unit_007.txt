Total RNAs were isolated using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was prepared using Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher #K1642, Invitrogen). qRT‑PCR samples were run in technical triplicates using SYBR Green Master mix (Roche#04887352001) on a LightCycler 480 instrument with a 2‑step protocol with a 60 °C annealing/elongation step. Results are given as fold change over undifferentiated hPSCs using housekeeping genes (ACTB and GAPDH) for normalization.
