Both conventional and silk‑VM organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 h at 4 °C followed by washing in PBS three times for 10 min. The interaction were left to sink in 30% sucrose overnight. Sucrose solution was replaced with 1:1 OCT:30% sucrose mixture for 6 h and then transferred to a cryomold and filled with OCT. The embedded tissue was frozen on dry ice and either cryosectioned at 20 μm or stored at −80 °C. For immunohistochemistry, sections were washed in PBS1X for 10 min and then blocked and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X‑100 and 5% normal donkey serum in PBS1X. After incubation with primary antibodies, the sections were incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 594, and 647 used at 1:400, Molecular Probes) and then mounted on gelatin‑coated slides and coverslipped with PVA‑DABCO containing DAPI.
