Air bubbles were introduced into the droplet by pipetting up and down (10–15 strokes), creating a dense foam. Multiple foams are generated in series with uniform shape and size. Foam can also assume different dimensions by increasing/reducing the volume of silk droplet giving rise to different organoid size in culture.
