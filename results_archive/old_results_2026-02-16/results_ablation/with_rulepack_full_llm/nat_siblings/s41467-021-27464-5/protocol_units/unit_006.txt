Cell‑viability analysis. Cell viability was measured using the colorimetric CyQuant cell proliferation assay (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was analyzed at 480–520 nm, using 50,000 cells harvested from whole conventional and silk‑VM organoids. Each organoid was analyzed in 6 replicates (i.e., 300 000 cells from each organoid) using a Biochrom Asys Expert 96 Microplate Reader (Biochrom).
