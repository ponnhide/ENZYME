Chronoamperometry. Three‑electrode setup with a pyrolyzed carbon fiber as the working electrode was used to detect dopamine. Electrode fabrication, chemical characterization, and setup assembly were performed as previously described62. In short, to perform the measurements, an organoid was placed on the working electrode immersed in baseline buffer, a constant potential was applied, and the resulting current monitored. Dopamine release was chemically triggered through addition of stimulation buffer that elevated K+ concentration to 150 mM.
