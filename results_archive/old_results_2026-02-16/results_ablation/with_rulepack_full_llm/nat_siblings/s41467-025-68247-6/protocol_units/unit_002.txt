crypts were plated in Matrigel droplets, at a density of 30–50 crypts per droplet. Once Matrigel had solidified for 30 min at 37 °C, crypts were fed with organoid growth media65: Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1X Pen‑Strep, 10 mM HEPES, 1X GlutaMAX, 1X B‑27 Supplement, 0.2 nM Wnt Surrogate protein, 5 nM Gastrin‑1, 1.25mM N‑Acetyl‑L‑Cysteine, 10 mM Nicotinamide, 100 µg/mL Primocin, 500 nM A 83‑01, 50 ng/mL recombinant human EGF, 100 ng/mL recombinant human Noggin, 250 ng/mL recombinant human R‑spondin 3, 100 ng/mL recombinant human IGF1, 50 ng/mL recombinant human FGF2, and with 10 µM Y‑27632.
