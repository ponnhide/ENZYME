For scRNA‑seq experiments, organoids were dissociated using the Neural Dissociation‑P kit (Miltenyi). Organoids were pipetted out of their microwell plates and into a deep‑well 96 well plate (Thermo Fisher) for dissociation. Enzyme mix 1 was prepared according to manufacturer protocols with the addition of Y‑27632 for a final volume containing human recombinant proteins, and organoids were collected for scRNA‑seq on day 8 post‑seeding.
