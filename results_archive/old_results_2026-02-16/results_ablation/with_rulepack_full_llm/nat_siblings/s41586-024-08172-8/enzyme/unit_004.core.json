For any dataset collected using the v.3 chemistry by 10X Genomics, which contains more than 500 cells after the filtering, we fitted a Gaussian distribution to the histogram denoting the number of expressed genes per cell. If a bimodal distribution was detected, we removed any cell with fewer genes expressed than defined by the valley between the two maxima of the distribution. Cells with any z‑transformed metric less than -1.96 or greater than 1.96 are defined as outliers."
