For regional labels, only the non-telencephalic regions, namely diencephalon, hypothalamus, thalamus, midbrain, midbrain dorsal, midbrain ventral, hindbrain, cerebellum, pons and medulla, were considered valid categories to be transferred. The label-transfer procedure was only applied to the non-telencephalic NPCs and neurons in HNOCA. Before any major voting was done, the support scores of each valid category across all non-telencephalic NPCs and neurons in HNOCA were smoothed with a random-walk-with-restart procedure (restart probability alpha = 85%). Majority voting was applied to assign each cell to one of the three structures.
