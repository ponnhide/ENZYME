We curated all neural organoid datasets used in this study through the sfaira78 framework (GitHub dev branch, 18 April 2023). We harmonized metadata according to the sfaira standards (https://sfaira.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adding_datasets.html) and manually curated an extra metadata column organoid_age_days, which described the number of days the organoid had been in culture before collection.
