To infer a global ordering of differentiation state, we sought to infer a real-time-informed pseudotime on the basis of neural optimal transport47 in the scPoli latent space. We first grouped organoid age in days into seven bins ((0, 15], (15, 30], (30,60], (60, 90], (90, 120], (120, 150], (150, 450]). Next, we used moscot48 to solve a temporal neural problem. We computed a transition matrix from displacement vectors and used diffusion maps87. Ranks on diffusion component 1 were used as a pseudotemporal ordering.
