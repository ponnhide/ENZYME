Step no. Issue Possible reasons Possible solutions
23 Low density of stem cells in culture after Initial density of cell was miscalculated Replate stem cells at higher density
replating
24 Many dead floating cells and debris in neural Floating cells are not sufficiently removed during Tilt the plate ~30° during medium
induction medium medium changes changes and try to aspirate most floating
cells and debris
33 Cell clusters are not attached after replating Dispase has not been completely washed out Add one more wash step and completely
remove washing medium
35 Few or no NRs This may be related to the quality of stem cells, Test another batch of stem cells, use
quality of reagents used for differentiation, or freshly prepared reagents, and reduce
breakage of the clump into pieces that are too small the number of pipetting steps during
replating
Small NRs and most NRs are in clusters It is early in differentiation or it is stem cell line Replate clusters of NRs as described in
specific‑phenotype Step 37
45 Lots of dead cells and debris in a well with an SNRs are transferred with other floating cells from During media changes, add fresh medium
isolated rosette/organoid the original dish swiftly to wash the organoid
Isolated SNRs do not grow in suspension culture Isolated SNRs are <200 μm in diameter or the Isolate SNRs that are ≥200 μm in diameter.
medium does not contain enough FGF Ensure the final FGF concentration is
10 ng/mL
55 MG droplet with an organoid does not fall off Incubation period was too long Keep the incubation time at exactly
from Parafilm dimple after incubation 30 min or reduce it to 25 min
MG droplets with organoids are floating on the Droplets have become stuck at the phase separation Add media dropwise over
surface and do not settle to the bottom of the air and medium until they sink
 dish
58 Organoid falls off of MG droplet MG droplets were damaged while being sprayed Re‑embed organoid in MG droplet
with medium
Organoids fuse with each other Too many organoids are in the Petri dish Separate fused organoids under a
stereoscope using a glass hook. Keep no
more than 10 organoids per 10 cm dish
61A(viii), B(xiii) More than 50% of cells are dead among Dissociation procedures are too harsh Increase papain incubation time and
dissociated cells for scRNA‑seq decrease number of pipetting steps
61C(x) Organoid section used for Organoids are 3D structures and some surface Inspect all sections produced from an
immunohistochemistry contains no lumen
sections may not include the lumen organoid on a wide‑field microscope and
identify those with a clearly visible lumen
for immunohistochemistry
61D(iii) Organoid sticks to spatula while trying to glue it MG and organoids could be sticky and tightly Use a spatula made of plastic and
to vibratome stage attached to clean glass or plastic immerse it in 3% BSA solution before use
MG may still be present inside of the organoid
slices because they are beneath MG layer
