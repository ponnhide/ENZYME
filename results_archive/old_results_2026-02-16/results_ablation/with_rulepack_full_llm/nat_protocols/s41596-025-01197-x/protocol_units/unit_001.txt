Stage 1: PS cell maintenance and propagation
Thawing PS cells
● TIMING 2 h
1. Warm a 6-well plate with MG-coated wells by placing it in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for
 ~30 min or keeping it at room temperature for 1 h in a biosafety cabinet.
2. Aliquot 6 mL of E8 medium and 3 mL of stem cell medium per a frozen vial of PS cells into
 separate 15 mL Falcon tubes. Warm medium aliquots to 37 °C and add 3 μL of Y-27632
 (1:1,000) to stem cell medium.
3. Take a frozen aliquot of cells from liquid nitrogen and thaw the aliquot by dipping it in a
 37 °C water bath while monitoring the process every few seconds.
▲ CAUTION Safety goggles must be worn when thawing frozen cells, as the vial with cells
 may contain some liquid nitrogen and burst upon immersion in the water bath.
4. As the vial of cells starts thawing take the aliquot to the biosafety cabinet after thoroughly
 spraying it with 70% ethanol and wiping it with a napkin.
