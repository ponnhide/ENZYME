Efficient neural induction of PS cells in vitro can be achieved through the use of dual‑SMAD
 inhibition via co‑application of a BMP–SMAD1/5/8 inhibitor, such as Noggin, LDN193189 or
 dorsomorphin, and an inhibitor of the TGF‑β–activin–NODAL–SMAD2/3 signaling pathway,
 such as SB‑431542 (ref. 18). The dual‑SMAD inhibitors induce the neuralization of ectodermal
 tissue while destabilizing the pluripotency gene expression networks and suppressing the
 induction of mesodermal fates in PS cells. Thus, we use the dual‑SMAD inhibitors dorsomorphin
 (4 μM) and SB‑431542 (10 μM) in neurobasal media with the vitamin A‑containing B27
 supplement for neural induction (Figs. 1 and 2a–c).
