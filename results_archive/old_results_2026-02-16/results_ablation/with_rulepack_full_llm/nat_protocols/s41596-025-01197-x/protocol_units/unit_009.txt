Option D: slicing and patch‑clamp electrophysiology
● TIMING 1 d
(i) Organoid preparation and mounting: transfer a 5‑month‑old organoid to a 6 cm dish with ice‑cold, oxygenated cutting ACSF using a P1000 pipette tip cut to avoid damaging the organoid.
(ii) Prepare the vibratome by wiping the vibratome chamber with Kimwipes and coating the post with a thin layer of superglue.
(iii) Mount the organoid on the glue‑coated post using a plastic spatula (Fig. 9a). To prevent the organoid from sticking to the spatula, dip the spatula into PBS containing 0.5% BSA before use. Allow the organoid to attach firmly to the post.
(iv) Fill the vibratome chamber with ice‑cold, oxygenated cutting ACSF. Connect tubing to the vibratome chamber to bubble cutting ACSF with carbogen during slicing.
(v) Slicing: cut 350‑µm‑thick slices using the vibratome set to 100 Hz frequency, 1.2 mm amplitude and a very slow forward movement velocity (Fig. 9b).
(vi) Stop the vibratome after each slice. Under a magnifying glass, use a bent insulin needle to separate the slice from the remaining tissue, and transfer the slice into a maintenance beaker with bubbling ACSF using a wide Pasteur pipette. Try to keep the slices in an upside‑down orientation in the maintenance beaker (with the surface that was in contact with the blade facing upward) relative to their original position during slicing. Approximately six slices can be prepared from a 5‑month‑old organoid.
(vii) Maintain the collected slices in the beaker placed in a water bath at 35 °C for ~30 min. Then keep the beaker with slices at room temperature for the duration of the experiment.
(viii) Patch‑clamp experiment: transfer a slice into the recording chamber using a wide Pasteur pipette. Place a harp slice grid over the slice to hold it in place during the experiment and start perfusion with oxygenated ACSF at a flow rate of ~3 mL/min.
(ix) Prepare a patch pipette from a thin‑walled borosilicate glass tube with an access resistance of 5–8 MΩ, measured when the pipette is filled with a standard potassium‑based intracellular solution and immersed in ACSF in the recording chamber.
(x) Using a 10× objective, identify an area in the slice with clear lamination. Switch to a 40× water‑immersive objective to inspect the area and identify a healthy neuron for patching.
(xi) Before inserting the pipette into the ACSF, apply a light positive pressure. Locate the pipette tip on the monitor screen and begin moving toward the slice surface while adjusting the focus to keep the tip in view.
(xii) Slowly approach the selected neuron, positioning the patch pipette diagonally relative to the neuron (Fig. 9c). Move forward diagonally at a very slow speed until a pressure‑induced dimple is visible on the cell surface.
(xiii) Release the positive pressure and apply light negative pressure using suction to facilitate seal formation between the pipette and the plasma membrane. Avoid suctioning the membrane into the pipette to prevent membrane closure and unstable input resistance during recording.
(xiv) Change the pipette potential step‑wise (ΔV = −10 mV) to negative values (−50 to −70 mV) to facilitate the formation of the Giga seal.
(xv) After forming a Giga seal, apply several brief, strong negative suction pulses to rupture the plasma membrane inside the pipette. Monitor the increase in capacitance transient to confirm membrane rupture and establishment of the ‘whole‑cell’ patch‑clamp configuration.
(xvi) Once a ‘whole‑cell’ patch‑clamp configuration is established, record the cell in ‘current‑clamp’ mode to measure voltage deflections in response to different somatic current injections while holding it at negative membrane potential (–60 to –70 mV).
(xvii) Use the AllenSDK ephys package (Allen SDK, 2015) for experimental protocol design and analysis (Fig. 9e).
