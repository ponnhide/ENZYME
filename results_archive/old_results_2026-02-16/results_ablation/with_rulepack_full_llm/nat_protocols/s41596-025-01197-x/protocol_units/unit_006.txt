Embedding SNR‑derived organoids in MG droplets
● TIMING 2–4 h
46. Place a box of P200 pipette tips in a −20 °C freezer for at least 15 min to cool them before use
 for embedding.
47. Thaw MG aliquot(s) on ice 1–2 h before embedding; 30 μL of MG will be needed for
 embedding each organoid.
▲ CRITICAL STEP Keep MG on ice at all times to avoid MG gelation.
48. Cut an ~40 mm square of Parafilm and disinfect it by spraying with 70% ethanol. Place the
 Parafilm over of the plastic portion of an empty P200 pipette tip holder (the section with
 holes). Using the rubber end of a 3 mL syringe plunger, apply pressure to the parafilm
 directly above a hole to form a dimple to be filled with MG. Repeat this step to make the
 necessary number of dimples (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b).
▲ CAUTION Although 70% ethanol is a commonly used disinfectant, it may not fully
 decontaminate the Parafilm. Alternatively, the Parafilm pieces can be prepared in advance
 and decontaminated using gamma irradiation.
49. Carefully detach the Parafilm square from the pipette tip holder by peeling it away from the
 surface while maintaining the dimple shape.
50. Place the dimpled Parafilm square on the inside of a sterile 10 cm Petri dish lid and press
 the Parafilm corners onto the surface using a fingernail so that it becomes stuck to the lid.
 This will tilt the corners without squashing the dimples (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
51. Fill another 10 cm Petri dish with 15 mL organoid propagation medium (without FGF2
 and EGF) and place it in the incubator. This dish will be used for MG droplet solidification
 in the incubator (Step 54).
52. Transfer individual organoids to individual Parafilm dimples using a P200 pipette tip
 (first cut the tip to enlarge the tip opening to fit the organoid) (Fig. 5a). Remove excess
 media from the dimples using a P200 pipette. Perform this step under the stereoscope
 to avoid aspiration of the organoids.
53. Retrieve P200 pipette tips from the −20 °C freezer and use the cold tips to draw up 30 μL
 thawed MG. Then, carefully add MG on top of the organoid in the Parafilm dimple. Use the
 same tip to reposition the organoid into the center of the MG droplet and remove bubbles
 if accidentally introduced.
▲ CRITICAL STEP Perform this step quickly to minimize the time the organoid is out of
 medium and prevent of MG gelation. We usually embed 6–10 organoids at a time.
54. Place the lid with organoids on the plate containing the organoid propagation medium,
 so that the Parafilm is now upside down without the MG droplets touching the medium
 (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Transfer the dish to a 37 °C incubator and incubate for 30 min.
 During this time, the MG will gelate. The MG becomes viscous at room temperature and
 will not fall off of the Parafilm.
55. Retrieve the dish from the incubator and bring it into the biosafety cabinet. Detach the
 Parafilm from the lid and use an ethanol‑disinfected gloved finger to pop out the dimples.
 Hold the Parafilm square vertically over the plate and use a P1000 pipette with 1 mL medium
 from the dish to spray quickly at each MG droplet, causing the droplet to slide into the
 media in the plate. Repeat until all organoids are in the plate. If the MG droplets are floating,
 add some medium dropwise over them until they sink. We usually have 6–10 organoids per
 10 cm dish.
▲ CRITICAL STEP It is important to observe MG‑embedded organoids in the dish to
 avoid aspirating them into the pipette while taking medium from the dish to spray off the
 remaining organoids.
56. Inspect the collected MG‑embedded organoids under a microscope to ensure that the MG
 droplets are intact after being sprayed with media. Any organoids in damaged droplets will
 need to be re‑embedded.
57. Place the dish with organoids into the incubator. Keep it stationary for ~48 h; afterward,
 transfer it to an orbital shaker (45 rpm) in the incubator.
▲ CRITICAL STEP Record the number of organoids in each plate. If organoids stick to each
 other, use a glass hook under a stereoscope to separate them.
