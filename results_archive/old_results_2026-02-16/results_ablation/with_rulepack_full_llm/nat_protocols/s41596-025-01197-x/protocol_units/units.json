For each well to be passaged, aliquot and warm 10 mL N2/B27 medium (for washing), 1 mL dispase\n (for dissociation) and 12 mL of amplification medium without EGF and FGF2 for replating.\n Add 10 ng/mL FGF2 (1:10,000) and 10 ng/mL EGF (1:10,000) to warm amplification medium\n just before use.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP Growth factors such as FGF2 and EGF are extremely sensitive to temperature\n fluctuations. Keep the stock solutions refrigerated at all times.\n27. Aspirate neural induction medium and add 1 mL dispase per well. Incubate the plate at 37 °C.\n Begin monitoring cell detachment under a microscope after 5 min of incubation. Some lines\n may already be detached after 5 min. However, it takes 15‑20 min for the cell sheet to detach\n for most PS cell lines. Once the sheet of cells is detached, carefully transfer it\n into a 15 mL conical tube using a 5 mL serological pipet.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP Incubation of cells with dispase should be no longer than 20 min.\n28. Let the cell clump settle to the bottom of the tube by gravity. This will take 1‑2 min.\n Then, carefully remove the supernatant using a 1 mL pipet to avoid disturbing the clump\n at the bottom.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP Do not use an aspirator to remove the supernatant as the clump of cells\n may be aspirated accidentally.\n29. Wash it three times using 3 mL N2/B27 medium. During each washing step, dislodge the\n clump from the bottom of the tube with medium while carefully avoiding breaking it into\n pieces. Let it settle to the bottom of the tube after each wash.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP It is important to thoroughly wash out the enzyme solution. Residual\n enzyme may cause excessive cell death. If many floating cells are detected the next day,\n increase the volume of medium used for washing and the number of washing steps.\n30. After the last wash, add 4 mL amplification medium and gently triturate (~5 times) the\n clump of cells using a 5 mL pipette to break it into small clumps of cells that are ~750 μm\n by 750 μm in size. Check the size under the microscope.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP The clump size is important. We observed delayed emergence of NRs\n from smaller clumps of cells (<~300 μm by 300 μm). However, if the clump is too large\n (>~2,500 μm by 2,500 μm), it may not attach.\n31. Replate the resultant clumps of cell at low density to promote NR formation. We usually\n replate one well into three or four 35 mm dishes. To replate into three dishes, transfer all cell\n clumps into a 15 mL conical tube and adjust the total volume with amplification medium to\n 12 mL. If replating four dishes, scale the total volume to 16 mL. Then, split the total volume\n between three MG‑coated dishes.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP To achieve equal distribution of cell clusters between the wells, pipette\n them up and down twice before drawing medium into the pipette for plating.\n32. Place the dishes with cell clusters in an incubator and move them back‑and‑forth and\n side‑to‑side to evenly distribute clusters over the entire surface.\n33. Change the medium every other day (two medium changes total, on days 2 and\n 4 post‑replating) by aspirating ~50% of the old medium and adding 2 mL of fresh\n amplification medium with 2× concentrations of FGF2 and EGF to achieve final FGF2\n and EGF concentrations of ~10 ng/mL. The clusters of NRs should begin emerging after\n two medium changes or 5‑6 d post‑replating (Fig. 2d).",

Place a box of P200 pipette tips in a −20 °C freezer for at least 15 min to cool them before use\n for embedding.\n47. Thaw MG aliquot(s) on ice 1–2 h before embedding; 30 μL of MG will be needed for\n embedding each organoid.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP Keep MG on ice at all times to avoid MG gelation.\n48. Cut an ~40 mm square of Parafilm and disinfect it by spraying with 70% ethanol. Place the\n Parafilm over of the plastic portion of an empty P200 pipette tip holder (the section with\n holes). Using the rubber end of a 3 mL syringe plunger, apply pressure to the parafilm\n directly above a hole to form a dimple to be filled with MG. Repeat this step to make the\n necessary number of dimples (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b).\n▲ CAUTION Although 70% ethanol is a commonly used disinfectant, it may not fully\n decontaminate the Parafilm. Alternatively, the Parafilm pieces can be prepared in advance\n and decontaminated using gamma irradiation.\n49. Carefully detach the Parafilm square from the pipette tip holder by peeling it away from the\n surface while maintaining the dimple shape.\n50. Place the dimpled Parafilm square on the inside of a sterile 10 cm Petri dish lid and press\n the Parafilm corners onto the surface using a fingernail so that it becomes stuck to the lid.\n This will tilt the corners without squashing the dimples (Supplementary Fig. 1c).\n51. Fill another 10 cm Petri dish with 15 mL organoid propagation medium (without FGF2\n and EGF) and place it in the incubator. This dish will be used for MG droplet solidification\n in the incubator (Step 54).\n52. Transfer individual organoids to individual Parafilm dimples using a P200 pipette tip\n (first cut the tip to enlarge the tip opening to fit the organoid) (Fig. 5a). Remove excess\n media from the dimples using a P200 pipette. Perform this step under the stereoscope\n to avoid aspiration of the organoids.\n53. Retrieve P200 pipette tips from the −20 °C freezer and use the cold tips to draw up 30 μL\n thawed MG. Then, carefully add MG on top of the organoid in the Parafilm dimple. Use the\n same tip to reposition the organoid into the center of the MG droplet and remove bubbles\n if accidentally introduced.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP Perform this step quickly to minimize the time the organoid is out of\n medium and prevent of MG gelation. We usually embed 6–10 organoids at a time.\n54. Place the lid with organoids on the plate containing the organoid propagation medium,\n so that the Parafilm is now upside down without the MG droplets touching the medium\n (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Transfer the dish to a 37 °C incubator and incubate for 30 min.\n During this time, the MG will gelate. The MG becomes viscous at room temperature and\n will not fall off of the Parafilm.\n55. Retrieve the dish from the incubator and bring it into the biosafety cabinet. Detach the\n Parafilm from the lid and use an ethanol‑disinfected gloved finger to pop out the dimples.\n Hold the Parafilm square vertically over the plate and use a P1000 pipette with 1 mL medium\n from the dish to spray quickly at each MG droplet, causing the droplet to slide into the\n media in the plate. Repeat until all organoids are in the plate. If the MG droplets are floating,\n add some medium dropwise over them until they sink. We usually have 6–10 organoids per\n 10 cm dish.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP It is important to observe MG‑embedded organoids in the dish to\n avoid aspirating them into the pipette while taking medium from the dish to spray off the\n remaining organoids.\n56. Inspect the collected MG‑embedded organoids under a microscope to ensure that the MG\n droplets are intact after being sprayed with media. Any organoids in damaged droplets will\n need to be re‑embedded.\n57. Place the dish with organoids into the incubator. Keep it stationary for ~48 h; afterward,\n transfer it to an orbital shaker (45 rpm) in the incubator.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP Record the number of organoids in each plate.

      "text": "Option D: slicing and patch‑clamp electrophysiology\n● TIMING 1 d\n(i) Organoid preparation and mounting: transfer a 5‑month‑old organoid to a 6 cm dish with ice‑cold, oxygenated cutting ACSF using a P1000 pipette tip cut to avoid damaging the organoid.\n(ii) Prepare the vibratome by wiping the vibratome chamber with Kimwipes and coating the post with a thin layer of superglue.\n(iii) Mount the organoid on the glue‑coated post using a plastic spatula (Fig. 9a). To prevent the organoid from sticking to the spatula, dip the spatula into PBS containing 0.5% BSA before use. Allow the organoid to attach firmly to the post.\n(iv) Fill the vibratome chamber with ice‑cold, oxygenated cutting ACSF. Connect tubing to the vibratome chamber to bubble cutting ACSF with carbogen during slicing.\n(v) Slicing: cut 350‑µm‑thick slices using the vibratome set to 100 Hz frequency, 1.2 mm amplitude and a very slow forward movement velocity (Fig. 9b).\n(vi) Stop the vibratome after each slice. Under a magnifying glass, use a bent insulin needle to separate the slice from the remaining tissue, and transfer the slice into a maintenance beaker with bubbling ACSF using a wide Pasteur pipette. Try to keep the slices in an upside‑down orientation in the maintenance beaker (with the surface that was in contact with the blade facing upward) relative to their original position during slicing. Approximately six slices can be prepared from a 5‑month‑old organoid.\n(vii) Maintain the collected slices in the beaker placed in a water bath at 35 °C for ~30 min. Then keep the beaker with slices at room temperature for the duration of the experiment.\n(viii) Patch‑clamp experiment: transfer a slice into the recording chamber using a wide Pasteur pipette. Place a harp slice grid over the slice to hold it in place during the experiment and start perfusion with oxygenated ACSF at a flow rate of ~3 mL/min.\n(ix) Prepare a patch pipette from a thin‑walled borosilicate glass tube with an access resistance of 5–8 MΩ, measured when the pipette is filled with a standard potassium‑based intracellular solution and immersed in ACSF in the recording chamber.\n(x) Using a 10× objective, identify an area in the slice with clear lamination. Switch to a 40× water‑immersive objective to inspect the area and identify a healthy neuron for patching.\n(xi) Before inserting the pipette into the ACSF, apply a light positive pressure. Locate the pipette tip on the monitor screen and begin moving toward the slice surface while adjusting the focus to keep the tip in view.\n(xii) Slowly approach the selected neuron, positioning the patch pipette diagonally relative to the neuron (Fig. 9c). Move forward diagonally at a very slow speed until a pressure‑induced dimple is visible on the cell surface.\n(xiii) Release the positive pressure and apply light negative pressure using suction to facilitate seal formation between the pipette and the plasma membrane. Avoid suctioning the membrane into the pipette to prevent membrane closure and unstable input resistance during recording.\n(xiv) Change the pipette potential step‑wise (ΔV = −10 mV) to negative values (−50 to −70 mV) to facilitate the formation of the Giga seal.\n(xv) After forming a Giga seal, apply several brief, strong negative suction pulses to rupture the plasma membrane inside the pipette. Monitor the increase in capacitance transient to confirm membrane rupture and establishment of the ‘whole‑cell’ patch‑clamp configuration.\n(xvi) Once a ‘whole‑cell’ patch‑clamp configuration is established, record the cell in ‘current‑clamp’ mode to measure voltage deflections in response to different somatic current injections while holding it at negative membrane potential (–60 to –70 mV).\n(xvii) Use the AllenSDK ephys package (Allen SDK, 2015) for experimental protocol design and analysis (Fig. 9e).",
