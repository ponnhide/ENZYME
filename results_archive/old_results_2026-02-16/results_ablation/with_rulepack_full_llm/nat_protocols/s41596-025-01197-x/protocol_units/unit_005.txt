SNR isolation
● TIMING 1–3 d
39. Prepare the amplification medium with EGF (10 ng/mL) and FGF2 (10 ng/mL) and fill each
 well of an ultralow attachment 96‑well plate with 300 μL of medium before placement of the
 plate in the incubator.
40. Prepare a glass hook from a glass Pasteur pipette using a Bunsen burner (see ‘Equipment
 setup’). We do not usually reuse them.
41. Identify large SNRs (>200 μm in diameter) with a clearly visible single lumen for isolation
 under a stereoscope (Fig. 2e,f).
42. Carefully separate SNRs from the adjacent tissue using the glass hook and gently detach
 each one from the bottom of the dish (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Video 2).
43. Transfer isolated SNRs to 96‑well plate (one SNR per well) using a P200 filtered pipette and
 return the plate to the incubator. We usually isolate 20–100 SNRs per day for 3 d. The plates
 with isolated SNRs are kept on an orbital shaker (45 rpm) in the incubator for 14–15 d.
