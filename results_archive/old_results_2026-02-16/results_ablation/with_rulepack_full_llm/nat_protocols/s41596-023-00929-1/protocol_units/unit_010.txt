96. Collect mural and/or endothelial cells sorted in Step 54.
97. Immediately after sorting, infect the cell population of interest with AAV–CMV–GFP. Mix the cell solution thoroughly using a pipette. We use 1 µL (stock titer of 1 × 10^13 GF/mL; 200 multiplicity of infection (MOI)) for 50,000 cells. Place cells at 37 °C for 30 min.
98. To avoid viral leakage into the organoids, wash cells three times with 1× PBS, each time spinning down at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C.
99. Select organoids for transplantation. Preferred organoids should display spherical shape and clear edges without any cell debris. Organoids vary in size, so a variety of organoid sizes will be used within a given experimental condition; ensure that you distribute different sizes across conditions.
100. Using a wide-opening pipette tip, move number of desired organoids onto Millicell culture inserts in a 6-well flat-bottom plate. Transwells help prevent the organoid from moving as the vascular cells are incorporated during the transplants. We recommend three to six organoids per condition.
101. Immediately before adding cells, gently remove as much medium surrounding the organoids within the well as possible using a p1000 pipette.
102. Gently add desired amount of cells on top of the organoids and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.
103. After incubation, gently add medium to well insert until the organoid floats off of the insert, ~3 mL.
104. Maintain organoids in a 37 °C incubator. The transwell can be removed the day after transplantation. After transplantation, maintain the organoids submerged in medium.
