1. Turn on rotating oven and allow it to heat up to 37 °C while you prepare your sample.
2. Obtain a 60 mm cell culture dish containing ~7 mL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.
3. Add 150 µL of pre-aliquoted DNase (10 mg/mL) to each dish.
4. Obtain ~250 mg of human brain tissue per sample. Document case details.
5. Place in dish containing HBSS/BSA/glucose + DNase.
6. With a scalpel, cut tissue into small (~2 mm × 2 mm chunks) in HBSS/BSA/glucose + DNase solution in a sterile environment (Fig. 2).
7. Distribute tissue into three 15 mL conical tubes.
 • Aliquot the tissue–buffer solution in the dish into the tubes first
 • Use extra HBSS/BSA/glucose buffer to wash the dish and make up to 5 mL per tube
8. Add 167 µL of collagenase/dispase (100 mg/mL) to each tube. Please note, 167 µL of collagenase/dispase per 5 mL is equivalent to 33.4 µL of solution per 1 mL.
9. Digest for 30 min in rotating oven at 37 °C.
