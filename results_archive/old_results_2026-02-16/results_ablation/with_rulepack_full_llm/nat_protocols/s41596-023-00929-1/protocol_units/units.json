After every single-color control has been run, the machine can perform compensation, the method of correcting for fluorescence spill over.\n48. Once the laser levels are set and compensation performed, the user can draw gates to select sequential populations (Fig. 3a). For this strategy, we recommend first eliminating debris with side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) gates.\n49. Next, eliminate doublets also with SSC or FSC.\n50. Eliminate dead cells. We use DAPI but a number of live/dead stains exist in different fluorophores.\n51. After eliminating debris, doublets and dead cells, then the user should set up FACS plots to select their population of interests. In our studies, endothelial cells were isolated as CD45−CD31+ANPEP− and mural cells were isolated as CD45−CD31−ANPEP+.\n52. (Optional) Run additional controls to determine the true population.
