36 Collect the cryogenic vial with the cryopreserved organoids from the liquid nitrogen tank on dry ice. 37 Per cryogenic vial to be thawed, prepare a 15‑ml conical tube with 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium at room temperature. 38 To thaw the freezing medium with the organoids, incubate the cryogenic vial for 1–3 min in a water bath at 37 °C. 39 Add 1 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium dropwise into the cryogenic vial while mixing, and then transfer the entire volume with the organoids in the vial to a 15‑ml conical tube. Fill the tube with adDMEM/F12+++ medium to a total volume of 10 ml. 40 Centrifuge the organoids at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C. 41 Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. 42 Follow Steps 22–25, as described above.
