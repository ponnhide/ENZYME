43 Split organoids 2 d before the start of the screen as previously described in Steps 17–25 (Table 2). 44 Check organoids using a microscope to assess the quality of the culture and exclude the possibility of culture contamination before commencing organoid preparation. 45 Add 1 mg/ml dispase II to the culture medium in each well, and disrupt BME droplets using a P1000 pipette. Place the plate back in the incubator for 40 min. 46 After 40 min, collect the content of the wells, and pipette up and down 10 times to facilitate disintegration of the BME. Top up with 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium per 2 ml of collected organoid suspension, resuspend using the pre‑wetted 10‑ml serological pipette and centrifuge. 47 Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium. 48 Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium, and filter the organoid suspension using a 70‑µm cell strainer. Transfer the filtered solution back to a 15‑ml conical tube, and spin down. 49 Resuspend the pellet in adDMEM/F12+++ medium (1–10 ml depending on the size of the pellet), and transfer 10 µl of the organoid solution to a disposable counting chamber. Count organoids, transfer the required amount of total organoid solution to a new 15‑ml conical tube and spin down. 50 Resuspend the pellet in complete organoid medium containing 5% (vol/vol) BME. For this, first resuspend the pellet with a P200 pipette in a small volume of the 5% (vol/vol) BME/organoid medium solution to ensure that the pellet is nicely resuspended. Subsequently, top up with the remaining volume of the mixture of medium and BME.
