51 Wash the tubing of the dispenser according to the manufacturer’s instructions. When using the Thermo system, start by washing the tubes with MilliQ water, followed by a wash with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol solution. Wash once with PBS. Subsequently, wash again with PBS from a clean 50‑ml conical tube. In general, clean tubes filled with solutions should be used only once, to prevent ‘contamination’ from previous wash steps being passed on to the next washing solution. A ‘wash’ is defined as flushing a minimum of twice the tube volume of liquid per tube through the tubing. Do not let the tubing dry after priming with PBS or medium, since the salts in the solution will form crystals in the tubes. 52 Before priming with organoids, flush the tubing at least once with ice‑cold adDMEM/F12+++ medium.
