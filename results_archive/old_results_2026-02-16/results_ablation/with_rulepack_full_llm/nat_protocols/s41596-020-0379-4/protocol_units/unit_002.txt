6 Digest the tissue (from Step 3) as appropriate based on the tumor type (Table 1). Carefully monitor digestion, and for <2-h incubations, mix contents every 10–15 min by shaking vigorously and by pipetting the mixture up and down using a P1000 pipette. For overnight incubations, place the mixture on a shaker. Addition of 10 µM ROCK inhibitor during digestion can increase outgrowth efficiency. For head and neck organoids, digestion should not exceed 1 h and should be monitored regularly. 7 When the mixture becomes cloudy and the remaining tissue fragments are disrupted, further aid tissue disruption by pipetting up and down 10–20 times using a P1000 pipette. Wash once by topping up with 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium, and centrifuge at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C. 8 Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium, and filter using a 100‑µm cell strainer. 9 Centrifuge the resuspended and filtered cells at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C. 10 Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in BME or Matrigel. BME should be kept on ice to prevent it from solidifying; thus, work quickly. The amount of BME depends on the size of the pellet. Approximately 10,000 cells should be plated in 40 µl of BME. 11 Plate the BME containing organoids on the bottom of pre‑heated 24‑well suspension cell culture plates in drops of ~10 µl each. Place three to four drops into each well. 12 Place the culture plate into a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2 for 20–30 min to let the BME solidify. 13 Prepare the required amount of organoid medium (tissue‑specific growth factors are listed in Supplementary Table 1), add 10 µM ROCK inhibitor and Primocin (100 µg/ml) and place medium in the 37 °C water bath. For head and neck organoids, additionally add 0.5 µg/ml caspofungin to the human head and neck organoid medium (see Reagent setup).
