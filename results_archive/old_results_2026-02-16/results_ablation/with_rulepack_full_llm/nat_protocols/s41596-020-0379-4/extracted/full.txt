 Else Driehuis , Kai Kretzschmar and Hans Clevers
 Adult stem cell–based organoid technology is a versatile tool for the generation and long-term maintenance of near-native
 3D epithelial tissues in vitro. The generation of cancer organoids from primary patient material enables a range of
 therapeutic agents to be tested in the resulting organoid cultures. Patient-derived cancer organoids therefore hold great
 promise for personalized medicine. Here, we provide an overview of the protocols used by different groups to establish
 organoids from various epithelial tissues and cancers, plus the different protocols subsequently used to test the in vitro
 therapy sensitivity of these patient-derived organoids. We also provide an in-depth protocol for the generation of head
 and neck squamous cell carcinoma organoids and their subsequent use in semi-automated therapy screens. Establishment
 of organoids and subsequent screening can be performed within 3 months, although this timeline is highly dependent on a.
 o. starting material and the number of therapies tested. The protocol provided may serve as a reference to successfully
 establish organoids from other cancer types and perform drug screenings thereof.

 Introduction
 The development of organoid technology opens new avenues for testing and development of ther-
 apeutic approaches in a pre-clinical setting. Generated from various types of stem cells, derived from
 different tissues and even different species, organoids are 3D structures that closely recapitulate tissue
 architecture and cellular composition1. Organoid cultures can be maintained long term while
 retaining genetic stability1. Generally established from both healthy and diseased tissue, adult stem
 cell–derived organoids consist of epithelial cells and provide an opportunity to expand patient-
 derived cells in the laboratory. Adult stem cell–derived organoids are a good model to study tissue
 homeostasis and regeneration. Pluripotent stem cell–derived organoids are better suited to study
 organ development and can (depending on the differentiation protocol applied) contain cell types
 derived from all three germ layers2. As a result, and in contrast to adult stem cell–derived organoids,
 pluripotent stem cell–derived organoids can contain both epithelial and non-epithelial cells.
 A large collection of protocols to generate organoids from different tissues has been established3–29.
 Researchers have begun to investigate whether these cultures are amenable to (high-throughput)
 drug-screening procedures that would allow testing of in vitro sensitivity to various compounds.
 Often, such screens are designed to model clinically applied therapeutic regimens. To assess the
 predictive potential of these patient-derived organoids, patient responses have been compared to the
 matched patient-derived organoid response9,11,19,30,31. The results obtained to date indicate that the
 in vitro response of patient-derived organoids is, in most cases, predictive for patient response to
 therapy30,32. As such, organoid technology has the potential to predict patient response, thereby
 holding great promise for personalized medicine.
 Here, we describe a general protocol for the establishment of patient-derived organoids. This
 protocol can be applied to a range of epithelial tissues. Our guidelines are based on previously
 published protocols, used by both our research group and others. We describe how these organoids
 may be applied in therapy screens, where both the seeding of organoids into 384-well plates and the
 exposure to chemotherapeutics are performed in a semi-automated fashion (Fig. 1a). In general,
 functional tests (such as the swelling assay applied to patient-derived intestinal organoids to assess
 responsiveness to cystic ﬁbrosis drugs33) can be easily performed in organoids to assess responses to

 Although the timeline for execution of this protocol is highly dependent on the starting material, the
 number of therapies tested and other variables, the establishment of organoids and subsequent
 screening can typically be performed within 3 months.
 When in vitro drug screening is performed using different experimental methods (different
 reagents, machines, readouts or protocols) and data analysis approaches, different absolute data
 points may be obtained34–36. However, others have shown that these inconsistencies can be mini-
 mized when drug screen responses are assessed as discrete values (i.e., trends) rather than as absolute
 values such as IC50 or area under the curve (AUC)37. In general, it is believed that the robustness of
 drug-screening data will increase when both screening methods and data analysis become more
 standardized. Others have investigated the variables that contribute most to data robustness and,
 thus, are most important to control when performing in vitro drug screens34,36,37. Although touched
 upon in this protocol, as we recommend using good laboratory practice guidelines that increase data
 robustness, an in-depth discussion of these variables is beyond the scope of this paper. Regardless, we
 hope this paper will contribute to the standardization of the screening methodology, which will make
 it easier to compare screening results between experiments, organoid cultures and even laboratories
 and different researchers.


 Overview of organoid culture methods
 Generation of epithelial organoid cultures
 Adult stem cell–derived organoids were ﬁrst generated from mouse intestinal epithelial stem cells
 (marked by the expression of Lgr5)27. Shortly after, the ﬁrst patient-derived organoids were estab-
 lished from adult human intestinal epithelial cells20,27. Protocols were subsequently adapted to grow
 organoids from other epithelial tissues (both healthy and diseased)38. Adult stem cell–based organoid
 technology is now widely used as a method to culture patient-speciﬁc cells in vitro. The approach can
 be used to generate collections of patient-derived cultures, or so called ‘living biobanks’39, that
 represent the heterogeneity of the disease of interest.
 Although protocols to establish organoids from primary tissue may differ depending on the
 epithelial tissue of origin, the source of tissue (normal or tumor), and the research group that
 established the method, general principles can be deﬁned (Table 1)5,6,8,9,11,14,16,18–22,29,30,38–57. Note
 that Table 1 includes studies that demonstrated organoid establishment from patient material that
 allowed culture maintenance for >10 passages.
 Organoids can be generated from solid surgical resection material (Fig. 1b), from smaller solid
 needle or punch biopsies30,58, nasal brush samples59, transurethral resections5 or ﬂuid samples such as
 urine29, ascites50 or broncho-alveolar lavage ﬂuid48. For solid tissue, the ﬁrst step is to remove as
 much non-epithelial tissue (such as muscle or fat) as possible (Fig. 1c). Typically, primary tissue is
 subsequently cut into small fragments (e.g., 1−3 mm3) using a scalpel, followed by enzymatic
 digestion to liberate the epithelial cells from the tissue. This dissociation results in single cells or small
 clumps of cells, which are plated in a 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel such as basement
 membrane extract (BME), Matrigel or Geltrex. The ECM hydrogel serves as an artiﬁcial lamina
 propria (Fig. 1d), and its use in organoid cultures was derived from an approach pioneered by Mina
 Bissell60. After plating, these cells are provided with a culture medium consisting of a growth factor
 cocktail known to trigger a regenerative (injury) response in the stem cells of the pertinent epithelium
 (Supplementary Table 1). Key components of this cocktail are generally: (i) activators of Wnt sig-
 naling, such as the Wnt ligand and the LGR5 ligand R-spondin (RSPO)27,61,62; (ii) ligands of tyrosine
 receptor kinases such as epidermal growth factor (EGF)63,64, known to promote epithelial pro-
 liferation; and (iii) inhibitors of transforming growth factor-β/bone morphogenetic protein signaling
 such as Noggin65, as this signaling pathway is known to induce epithelial differentiation. The

 respective medium composition (and thus signaling components required to grow the organoids)
 differs by tissue of origin. This procedure results in the formation of closed epithelial structures with a
 central lumen (in the case of non-stratiﬁed epithelia such as the colon epithelium) that is lined by the
 apical surface of the organoid cells. The outside organoid surface, which is formed by the basal side of
 the cells, expresses integrins and contacts the ECM hydrogel. The kinetics of organoid formation
 depends on the tissue of origin (Fig. 1e).
 Organoids can be established from a wide range of normal and tumor epithelial cells (examples are
 given in Fig. 1f) and can subsequently be expanded and cryo-preserved. Supplementary Table 1 gives
 an overview of the components of the culture media used by different laboratories to grow organoids
 derived from different tissues5,8,9,11,14,16,18–22,29,30,38–41,43–51,55,57,66,67. Note that Supplementary
 Table 1 reports only studies that both present a novel (not previously published) medium to culture
 (human) patient-derived adult stem cell–derived organoids and show long-term culture (>10 pas-
 sages). Therefore, studies that use previously reported media compositions are not included in the
 table. Moreover, Supplementary Table 1 contains only studies that describe completely deﬁned media
 conditions and use organoid systems based on ECM hydrogels such as BME or Matrigel. A detailed
 overview of the entire isolation procedure that was just described (exempliﬁed for organoids derived
 from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)), is given in Fig. 2.

 Screening of organoid cultures for sensitivity to therapeutic agents
 Different research groups have performed drug screens on patient-derived organoids (see Table 2 for
 an overview of the drug-screening protocols used)5,6,8,9,11,12,19,30–32,39,40,42,43,47–50,52–54,56–58,66–74.
 Although differences between these protocols exist (drug exposure timing, organoid size, timing of
 treatment start relative to the seeding of the organoids and the ECM hydrogel used), the applied
 procedures are overall similar. Details of the protocols used by different groups and for organoids
 derived from different tissues are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 includes studies that report on the

 screening of patient-derived adult stem cell–based organoids using a quantitative measure to assess
 cell viability after treatment. Additional approaches such as co-cultures of organoids and additional
 (patient-derived) cell types such as immune cells75,76 to study the effect of therapies are, although
 highly relevant, beyond the scope of this paper. Generally, organoids are passaged and given time to
 recover under normal culture conditions. Subsequently, organoids are collected, ﬁltered, counted and
 plated at the desired density and then exposed to the therapy of choice. Readout is—on average—
 performed 5 or 6 d after the start of the treatment, but ranges from 1 to 24 d of exposure to therapy.
 While some groups expose organoids directly after plating in the screening wells11,30,50,52,66, others let
 organoids recover for a number of days before commencing treatment5,9,19,32,39,43,68–70,77. Usually,
 when organoids are plated as single cells, drugs are added 1 d later. Encouragingly, it has been
 reported that the response of organoids to therapy is comparable when exposed to drugs either as
 single cells or multicellular structures43. Most organoid screens have been performed using low
 percentages of BME or Matrigel (ranging from 2% to 10%). However, some have used higher
 percentages of BME or Matrigel (ranging from 50% to 100%)30,53,66,69,70. In these cases, organoids
 were plated in ECM droplets (either on the day of screening or on the day of passage preceding the
 drug exposure). Newly developed ECM hydrogel alternatives to BME or Matrigel such as piglet
 mesenchyme–derived ECM hydrogels78 or fully deﬁned growth factor–free matrices have been
 described for organoid cultures79. Although such alternatives might bring down the cost of high-
 throughput screening, their use to either generate cancer organoids or perform organoid drug screens
 has not been reported to date.

 Experimental design
 Below, we describe the general steps for organoid culture and processing for drug screening. The
 procedure that is described here is suitable for screening organoids that can be passaged at least once
 every 14 d, with a split ratio of 1:2. To make it easier to adapt this protocol to culture different types
 of organoids, we highlight the steps where differences were observed between different published
 protocols, which, for example report on the generation of organoids from a different tissue type.
 Although this protocol describes the generation of HNSCC-derived organoids and their use for drug
 screening, this procedure can be adapted for various other normal or tumor tissue–derived organoids.

 Tissue collection and processing (Steps 1–5)
 Necrotic (tumor) tissue has poor organoid-forming efﬁciency. It is therefore important to obtain
 tissue pieces from viable (tumor) tissue, which is often pink in color, whereas necrotic tissue may
 appear yellowish. During transport to the laboratory, storage of tissue pieces in ice-cold basic medium
 ideally containing 10 µM Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor compound Y-2763 or (less desired) ice-cold
 PBS is essential to minimize cell death and increase organoid outgrowth. Tissue pieces should be
 collected and stored in media as soon as possible, in either the operating room or the pathological
 laboratory. These measures will improve cell viability. Under these conditions, we have succeeded in
 generating organoids from intercontinentally shipped tissue pieces, kept up to 72 h at 4 °C. Organoids
 can be established from cryopreserved tissues, although the efﬁciency of derivation is probably lower
 than that obtained when starting with fresh material.

 Organoid generation from primary tissue (Steps 6–16)
 Protocols to generate organoids from primary patient material are typically divided into several stages
 (we found one exception that did not describe a digestion step53): (i) mechanical fragmentation of
 tissue pieces using a scalpel or razor blades; (ii) digestion of fragments into a single-cell suspension or
 clumps of cells by using enzymes such as collagenase, DNase, dispase, hyaluronidase or trypsin (or its
 replacement enzyme TrypLE), enzyme mixes such as Liberase (an off-the-shelf combination of
 collagenases I and II and thermolysin) or chemicals such as EDTA (sometimes combined with
 trypsin); (iii) plating of cell preparations into drops of an ECM hydrogel such as BME or Matrigel;
 and (iv) culture using growth medium in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2.
 However, depending on the sampled tissue (bladder, colon, head and neck, etc.), the use of normal or
 tumor tissue and the group developing the protocol, the procedures to generate organoids may differ.
 In particular, the type of enzymes or chemicals and their concentrations, the digestion time, the
 resulting cell preparation, the ECM hydrogel, the plating concentration and the medium used may be
 different. We provide an overview of these differences in Table 1. Of the 33 approaches discussed
 here, 29 protocols require collagenase or Liberase, 10 trypsin or TrypLE, 5 hyaluronidase, 3 dispase,

3388 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 15 | OCTOBER 2020 | 3380–3409 | www.nature.com/nprot

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 3 DNase and 3 EDTA (in some studies, combinations of digestion enzymes were used). It is
 important to note that different protocols specify different types of collagenases/hyaluronidase to use
 for digestion. In most cases, digestion is performed at 37 °C in a water bath or an incubator.
 Incubation time ranges from 30 min to overnight digestion. Some protocols describe a regular check
 on the progress of the digestion to avoid overdigestion, as well as frequent shaking of the sample to
 avoid clumping of the cells (DNase may also be added to further minimize the risk of clumping). In
 addition, the ECM hydrogel and growth medium may vary. Yet, in all but one case8, advanced
 DMEM/F12 is used as the basic medium to prepare the complete organoid growth medium.
 Eventual organoid outgrowth efﬁciency is dependent on the quality of the sample obtained and the
 percentage of epithelial tumor cells in the sample30,32,49. Studies showed that the chance of growing
 organoids from any particular sample is, quite intuitively, higher if that sample contains a high
 percentage of tumor cells on pathological assessment. For HNSCC organoids, the outgrowth efﬁ-
 ciency from tumors is ~70% of all fragments plated. From other carcinoma types, organoid cultures
 have been established with success rates between ~60% (breast cancer)9 and >90% (colorectal can-
 cer)39. To increase the chance of optimal organoid formation, we recommend keeping 10 µM
 Y-27632 in the culture medium for the ﬁrst two passages and refreshing the medium every 2–3 d to
 ensure sufﬁcient growth factor concentrations for the cultured cells.
 Organoid cultures should be closely monitored for the ﬁrst few days after plating for potential
 bacterial and fungal infections. If such infections occur, 5 M NaOH (or other suitable disinfectant)
 should immediately be added to the infected wells, they should be left for 1 h and the contents should
 be removed. Washing of the contaminated well after removal of the organoid material plus disin-
 fection with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol and replacing the culture plate lid should minimize the chance of
 the infection spreading to other wells. Regular tests should be performed to ensure the cultures
 remain free of Mycoplasma. Basic growth medium contains the standard cocktail of the antibiotics
 penicillin and streptomycin. For samples taken from microbiome-positive areas such as the colon or
 the oral mucosa, we recommend adding additional antibiotics such as Primocin (for most samples,
 including the colon), vancomycin and gentamicin (in addition to Primocin, when generating orga-
 noids from the colon) and/or caspofungin (in addition to Primocin, when generating organoids from
 the oral mucosa) for the ﬁrst two passages.

 Organoid splitting and passaging (Steps 17–25)
 When using TrypLE digestions for passaging (enzymatic digestion should be used only for compact
 organoids that cannot be passaged using mechanical shearing), closely monitor the digestion process
 after addition of TrypLE to avoid over-digestion. Use a P1000 pipette to aid disruption of the
 organoids during digestion, and check the progress of digestion every 5 min under the microscope.
 Stop digestion when a mixture of small clusters of cells (consisting of three to ﬁve cells) and single
 cells is observed. When working with organoid cultures with cystic or grape-like morphology,
 mechanical shearing may be used instead of TrypLE to passage cultures. Ensure proper outgrowth of
 organoids by adding 10 µM Y-27632 to the culture medium directly after passaging. When the
 medium is refreshed 2–3 d later, this is no longer required.

 Organoid freezing and thawing (Steps 26–42)
 Freezing organoids when they are highly proliferative (usually 2–3 d after passaging) will improve
 their recovery. Freezing single cells is typically associated with reduced organoid recovery after
 thawing. Freezing of large, differentiated organoids usually results in poor recovery as well. Using the
 conditions provided in the protocol below, we have consistently reached a recovery rate of >50% of
 the re-plated organoids. Of note, freezing/thawing may cause changes in organoid morphology on
 recovery and might affect drug screening49. As such, we always recommend a minimum of one
 passage after thawing before organoids are used for drug screening. Additional splits might be
 required for cultures that do not recover well from thawing to get them recovered and ready for
 screening.

 Characterization of organoid cultures (quality control (QC))
 Although validation of the predictive potential of organoids is beyond the scope of this article, this
 protocol does contain QC steps that—in our opinion—are essential before drug screening can be
 performed. These include an assessment of how well the culture at hand recapitulates the tumor
 in vivo, and a validation that samples are matched to the patient from which they were derived. In our

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 opinion, this QC is a requirement before investigating potential correlations between organoid
 responses and DNA alterations/clinical responses detected in the patient.
 Before screening, it is important to assess that the established organoids represent the tumor of the
 patient. Potential contamination with normal cells (present in the resection or biopsy material used to
 establish the culture) should be considered, since this is a notorious problem when establishing
 patient-derived organoid cultures from primary tumor tissue1. To address the tumor purity of the
 culture, the variant allele frequency of mutations detected by bulk DNA sequencing can be used as a
 proxy for the percentage of tumor cells in the culture. To decrease the chances of wild-type con-
 tamination, methods to enrich for tumor cells in culture have been described. Selection with MDM2
 agonist Nutlin-3 has been used to select for TP53 mutant tumor cells in organoids48,80. EGF with-
 drawal has been used to select for RAS mutant (and thus epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-
 signaling independent) tumor cells11,22,39,58,81,82. Lastly, removal of Wnt and/or RSPO and other
 growth factors has allowed the selection of tumor cells with speciﬁc mutations39,49,81,82 and even
 speciﬁc tumor subtypes83. Although useful, the use of such ‘minimal’ medium49 selection should be
 applied with caution, as, most of the time, the genetic background of the tumor is unknown at the
 time of selection, and culture heterogeneity is potentially lost when such selection is applied.
 When organoids are established from metastatic lesions, contamination with normal cells is less
 common. When established from, for example, lymph node biopsies, bone biopsies or ascites ﬂuid, it
 is unlikely that wild-type epithelial cells will be present in the material used to establish a culture.
 Even if organoids can be established from wild-type tissue under the applied medium49 conditions,
 the resulting organoids can likely be discriminated from the tumor organoids based on their mor-
 phology (e.g., cystic liver organoids in a metastatic colorectal cancer culture derived from a liver
 metastasis). If morphologically distinct, organoids can be either manually removed from the culture
 or separated based on their density or size. A check to conﬁrm the identity of the removed organoids
 (for example, a quantitative PCR for tissue-speciﬁc markers or DNA sequencing for the absence of
 mutations) is recommended after the separation.
 Although it has been shown that organoids can capture tumor heterogeneity12,84, we recommend
 drug screening of low passage cultures to minimize the effect of potential in vitro selection by used
 culture media or accumulation of in vitro mutations. It has been shown previously that organoid
 cultures established from different tumor clones of the same tumor respond differently to therapy12.
 Therefore, it is plausible that heterogeneous organoid cultures can show more variability in drug
 response when the screen is repeated in both earlier and later passages of the culture (assuming clonal
 selection might occur in vitro). Especially here, genetic characterization of the organoid culture at the
 time of screening is essential.
 In summary, we advise on the genetic characterization of both the obtained organoid line and
 primary tissue to conﬁrm that the screened cells (i) are a representative culture (via targeted
 sequencing or whole exome or genome sequencing) and (ii) can be matched with the primary tissue
 from which they originated, for example, via SNP/STR (single-nucleotide polymorphism/short tan-
 dem repeat) analysis if no exome or genome sequencing is performed. For this, DNA collected on the
 day of screening would be the best control.

 Preparation of organoids for drug screening (Steps 43–50)
 Depending on their origin, organoids can be split by TrypLE digestion or mechanical disruption
 using a plugged glass Pasteur pipette. After organoid disruption, cells are plated and cultured as usual,
 in drops of BME or Matrigel that are covered with organoid expansion medium (the exact media
 composition varies according to the tissue of origin; see Supplementary Table 1). Certain growth
 factors or other medium components might inﬂuence the response to or interact with the drug being
 tested. Appropriate modiﬁcations to the growth media composition should therefore be considered
 and, if required, made accordingly. For example, when screening organoids to assess their response to
 anti-EGFR antibodies, the concentration of EGF present in the culture media will directly affect the
 readout19,39,85.

 Dispensing of organoids for screening (Steps 51–57)
 On the day the screen is started (the timing depends on which organoids are used to perform the
 screening), dispase can be added to the culture to remove the BME or Matrigel. Organoids should be
 subsequently washed and ﬁltered to remove large organoids, as large organoids will introduce var-
 iation in the readout of the screen. After ﬁltering, organoids are counted and the organoid suspension
 is brought to the desired density in organoid culture media containing 5% (vol/vol) BME or Matrigel.

 The optimal number of organoids per well varies by tissue. Lastly, organoids are dispensed in
 384-well plates at the desired density; we use a ThermoFisher Multidrop dispenser. Because of the
 presence of ECM in the organoid suspension, it is important to keep the organoid suspension cold
 and prime the tubing from the dispenser with cold PBS to prevent clogging of the tubing.


 Treatment of organoids with the therapy of interest (Steps 58–74)
 Chemotherapeutic agents can easily be dispensed into 384-well plates using a drug printer such as an
 HP D300e digital dispenser. An example of a drug screen layout created using the D300e software is
 shown in Fig. 3b. To properly assess cell viability during the readout, it is important to include wells
 containing a compound that kills all cells as a positive control (e.g., staurosporin or cycloheximide),
 and wells containing the relevant drug solvent as a negative control (Fig. 3c). In addition to che-
 motherapy, the effect of radiotherapy can also be assessed (by delivering different dosages to different
 plates of organoids using a gamma irradiator). It is important to include technical replicates on the
 screening plate (at least triplicates) to correct for intra-plate variability. Radiotherapy can be applied
 both as a single agent or combined with chemotherapy. For single-agent application, radiotherapy
 should be applied in multiple dosages, to determine AUC values (similar in principle to testing
 different concentrations of chemotherapy to determine IC50 values). Optimization of the screening
 setup should be considered for each new therapy tested, both the number of concentrations

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 (a minimum of nine according to ref. 36) and the range (e.g., to obtain measurements with at least two
 concentrations in each plateau of the kill curve according to ref. 86) to obtain accurate IC50 estimates.
 For chemoradiotherapy assessments, we apply radiation 1 d after the addition of a chemotherapeutic
 drug so that chemotherapy can properly act as a radiosensitizer in vitro.

 Readout and analysis of drug screening (Steps 75–88)
 We perform a readout for chemotherapeutic agents 5 d after the start of treatment. Depending on the
 application, the best timing may require optimization. An example of HNSCC organoids that were
 exposed to a carboplatin gradient is shown in Fig. 3d. For readout, intracellular ATP levels, which
 serve as a surrogate for cell viability, are measured using CellTiter-Glo 3D Reagent. After addition of
 the cell-viability reagent using the Multidrop dispenser, the culture plate with the organoids is
 incubated to allow lysis of the cells. Readout is performed by measuring the luminescence signal from
 each individual well. For analysis, the signal obtained from the wells with the negative controls (i.e.,
 drug solvent) is set to 100%, whereas the signal obtained from the wells containing the positive
 controls (i.e., staurosporin or cycloheximide) is set at 0%. These control wells are used to calculate Z
 factors to indicate the quality of the data generated in the screening plate. Eventually, kill curves can
 be generated that describe the sensitivity of individual organoid lines (Fig. 3e). IC50, AUC values or
 normalized growth rate inhibition (GR) metrics can be extrapolated for quantitative analysis (Fig. 3f).
 While we describe the use of ATP-based assays as a readout for cell viability, alternative readouts such
 as live imaging71,87, live/dead ﬂuorescent markers40 and CellTiter-Blue30 may be used and incor-
 porated into the drug-screening pipeline. In this paper, we describe data analysis using GraphPad
 Prism. We chose to describe analysis using this software, to allow any researcher (also without
 extensive bioinformatics skills) to perform data analysis and obtain graphs that allow visualization of
 these results. Prism also allows calculation of IC50 and/or AUC values, which can serve as a sum-
 marizing metric of the drug sensitivity of the tested culture. However, when analyzing large datasets
 containing many variables (e.g., performing screening of combination treatments where both drugs
 are titrated over a gradient), other analysis programs should be considered, since GraphPad Prism
 cannot handle such complex datasets.

 Interpretation of the screening results
 Using in vitro drug screening, IC50, AUC or GR metrics can be obtained for each individual patient-
 derived organoid line and for each therapy tested, with the latter metric showing the most robust
 results independent of cell division rate36. Although these values indicate in vitro sensitivities, they
 cannot be directly translated to clinical therapy resistance or sensitivity. Characterizing the range of
 IC50/AUC/GR metrics that can be obtained in vitro in a panel of patient-derived organoid lines, and
 learning how these values correlate to in vivo responses will be essential for interpreting these
 numbers. For this, it is important to screen a panel of organoids that capture the heterogeneity of the
 disease of interest. This should be taken into consideration when establishing these assays for
 therapies not previously tested. When possible, correlation to clinical responses in this ‘training set’
 will aid in translating the obtained in vitro values toward a clinically relevant result.
 Both IC50 and AUC are inﬂuenced by the in vitro proliferation rate. To uncouple the effect of cell
 proliferation from the sensitivity of the cells for the therapy tested, GR metrics can be used as a
 measure for in vitro drug sensitivity36. This requires only minor changes in experimental setup
 (collection of control values at the start of the experiment). Although the analysis required for the
 calculation of GR metrics is beyond the scope of this protocol, we do indicate these required changes
 in experimental setup in our protocol as optional steps. GR metrics can be easily calculated using the
 online GR calculator at http://www.grcalculator.org/grcalculator/. The use of GR values will result in
 higher reproducibility of the drug-screening result. However, it must be noted that taking this factor
 out of the equation could decrease the correlation between patient and organoid response, if pro-
 liferation rate in culture reﬂects the proliferation rate in vivo. Therefore, while screening the pre-
 viously mentioned ‘training set’ to assess predictive potential of organoids in a speciﬁc setting, we
 propose calculating all metrics to determine which one gives the most-reproducible results (which
 could vary depending on the therapy tested).
 Apart from these considerations, other factors such as the in vivo tumor microenvironment,
 patient general health, drug metabolism, patient pre-treatment, mode of action of the drugs tested,
 in vitro assay duration or culture artifacts (such as contamination with normal epithelial cells) may
 inﬂuence either patient response or drug-screening results and should be considered when comparing
 organoid and patient responses88.

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 It has been shown that methods used to determine drug sensitivity in vitro directly affect the
 reproducibility of the obtained results34,37. A report that compared results of two independent studies
 on sensitivity of cell lines to a range of different agents concluded that results obtained by the
 different groups only marginally correlated34. However, when results were not compared by the
 obtained absolute metrics (IC50 or AUC), but rather by using discrete values (i.e., trends indicating
 sensitivity or resistance), the results were found to correlate37. This suggests that, although variation
 cannot be eliminated, biologically relevant drug sensitivities can be detected using different meth-
 odologies. Important conclusions can be drawn from these studies: (i) absolute metrics will differ
 when different methodologies are applied34 and (ii) technical variability can be minimized by
 adhering to good laboratory practice. These basic drug-screening ‘rules’ should include the use of a
 drug dosage range ﬁne-tuned to the drug and cultures tested and adhering to methodological
 requirements36, adherence to standardized operating procedures rather than experience-based
 laboratory work and using the same readout for cell viability (e.g., following standardized viability
 statistics such as GR metrics)35,36. However, it has been shown that, even when adhering to these
 guidelines, variation (both biological and technical) is likely to still be observed when performing
 drug screening. It should be noted that the source of such variation was found to be highly variable
 itself35 and, thus, perhaps even impossible to eliminate following a standardized protocol. Therefore,
 we encourage all researchers to ﬁrst assess assay reproducibility in their own facilities when testing
 either a novel organoid model or novel compound, in addition to adhering to the guidelines men-
 tioned here and described by others in more detail35,37.

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

Procedure
 CRITICAL STEP Steps 1–42 describe how to generate and maintain organoid cultures from primary


 c
 human tissue material. The therapy screening protocol on the preparation of organoids and
 chemotherapeutics, as well as radiation and the subsequent cell-viability readout and its analysis, is
 described in Steps 43–81 and overviewed in Fig. 3a.

 Collection and preparation of primary human tissue for organoid culture generation
 ● Timing 1–24 h
 ! CAUTION Studies involving primary human tissue material must conform to all relevant institutional
 and governmental regulations. Informed consent must be obtained from all subjects before collection of
 the primary human tissue material.
 1 Collect primary human tissue pieces, separated by biopsy site and/or tissue type (i.e., normal and
 tumor tissue) in 45 ml of ice-cold adDMEM/F12+++ medium in 50-ml conical tubes. (Optional)
 Add 10 µM ROCK inhibitor to adDMEM/F12+++ medium to increase cell survival. Keep tissue
 samples in this medium at 4 °C until the start of the isolation.
 PAUSE POINT Depending on the primary tissue of origin, tissue pieces may be kept up to 72 h at
 j


 4 °C without signiﬁcant loss of organoid outgrowth, but, ideally, one should proceed with the next
 steps as soon as possible.
 2 Assess whether obtained tissue pieces consist purely of epithelium or if they also contain fat or
 muscle tissue. If so, remove non-epithelial components as much as possible using surgical scissors
 or scalpels and forceps under a dissection microscope. If not, continue to the next step immediately.
 CRITICAL STEP Non-epithelial material may slow down the digestion to single cells or cause an
 c


 overestimation of the number of (epithelial) cells with organoid-forming capacity.
 3 Mince the tissue into small fragments of 1–3 mm3 in a 10-cm cell culture dish using surgical
 scissors or scalpels.
 4 Fix one or two representative fragments in ﬁxative (i.e., 10% (wt/vol) formalin or 4% (wt/vol)
 paraformaldehyde) for histological analysis.
 5 Snap-freeze fragments for molecular (i.e., whole exome/genome sequencing or mRNA sequencing)
 or biochemical (i.e., Western blotting or proteomics) analysis at –80 °C. Such fragments may also
 be used to isolate DNA for quality controls/validation of patient of origin via SNP/STR
 ﬁngerprinting.

 Establishment of organoids from primary tissue ● Timing 2 h
 6 Digest the tissue (from Step 3) as appropriate based on the tumor type (Table 1). Carefully monitor
 digestion, and for <2-h incubations, mix contents every 10–15 min by shaking vigorously and by
 pipetting the mixture up and down using a P1000 pipette. For overnight incubations, place the
 mixture on a shaker. Addition of 10 µM ROCK inhibitor during digestion can increase outgrowth
 efﬁciency. For head and neck organoids, digestion should not exceed 1 h and should be monitored
 regularly.
 CRITICAL Carefully monitor the digestion, as over-digestion may signiﬁcantly decrease the
 c


 outgrowth efﬁciency. As a rule of thumb, digestion is complete when a mixture of cell clusters
 (consisting of 2–10 cells) can be observed. When commencing the culture of a new tissue type,
 it is recommended to take small samples from the digest during digestion and plate them to
 determine the best average digestion time for this particular tissue.
 7 When the mixture becomes cloudy and the remaining tissue fragments are disrupted, further aid
 tissue disruption by pipetting up and down 10–20 times using a P1000 pipette. Wash once by
 topping up with 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium, and centrifuge at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C.
 8 Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium, and ﬁlter using a 100-µm
 cell strainer.
 9 Centrifuge the resuspended and ﬁltered cells at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C.
 10 Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in BME or Matrigel. BME should be kept on ice
 to prevent it from solidifying; thus, work quickly. The amount of BME depends on the size of the
 pellet. Approximately 10,000 cells should be plated in 40 µl of BME.
 CRITICAL Do not dilute BME too much (BME should be >70% (vol/vol)) to ensure formation of
 c


 solid droplets.
 11 Plate the BME containing organoids on the bottom of pre-heated 24-well suspension cell culture
 plates in drops of ~10 µl each. Place three to four drops into each well.

3396 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 15 | OCTOBER 2020 | 3380–3409 | www.nature.com/nprot

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 CRITICAL Once the organoids are resuspended in BME, proceed with plating as quickly as


 c
 possible, as the BME may solidify in the tube or pipette tip.
 CRITICAL Plates should be pre-heated overnight by placing them into a humidiﬁed incubator at


 c
 37 °C. If not properly pre-heated, BME droplets will immediately ﬂatten out on the surface of the
 culture plate and organoids can more easily attach to the bottom of the plate.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 12 Place the culture plate into a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2 for 20–30 min to
 let the BME solidify.
 13 Prepare the required amount of organoid medium (tissue-speciﬁc growth factors are listed in
 Supplementary Table 1), add 10 µM ROCK inhibitor and Primocin (100 µg/ml) and place medium
 in the 37 °C water bath. For head and neck organoids, additionally add 0.5 µg/ml caspofungin to the
 human head and neck organoid medium (see Reagent setup).
 14 Once the BME drops are solidiﬁed (30–60 min), ﬂip the plate and carefully add 500 µl of organoid
 medium to each well.
 CRITICAL Do not add medium directly on top of the BME drops, as this might disrupt
 c


 the droplets.
 15 Place the culture plate in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2.
 16 Change the medium every 2–3 d by carefully aspirating medium from the wells and
 replacing it with fresh, pre-warmed medium. Keep ROCK inhibitor and Primocin (in the
 case of head and neck organoids, also caspofungin) in the culture medium for the ﬁrst two
 passages of the culture.
 CRITICAL BME drops may detach from the suspension plates and ‘swim’ in the medium. In this
 c


 case, we recommend re-plating the organoids without TrypLE-based organoid dissociation. Closely
 monitor organoid formation. Ideally, organoids should be passaged for the ﬁrst time between
 12 and 14 d after initial plating.
 CRITICAL Do not proceed too quickly to splitting, as this might result in termination of
 c


 the culture.
 CRITICAL In the ﬁrst passages, ensure optimal density of the culture (as a general rule of thumb,
 c


 aim for 10,000 cells per 40 µl), even if this means replating material to decrease the number
 of wells.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING


 Splitting of organoids ● Timing 1 h
 17 Pipette up and down to disrupt BME or Matrigel, and transfer the organoid suspension to a 15-ml
 conical tube.
 18 To aid in the removal of BME, top the volume up with 10 ml of ice-cold adDMEM/F12+++
 medium.
 19 Centrifuge organoids at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C.
 20 Aspirate the supernatant, and split organoids using either TrypLE (for head and neck and compact
 breast, colon, pancreatic and liver organoids) or mechanical disruption (ovarian and cystic breast,
 colon, pancreatic and liver organoids). For TrypLE-based cell dissociation, resuspend the pellet in 1
 ml of TrypLE, pipette up and down and incubate at 37 °C until organoids fall apart. Pipette up and
 down with a P1000 ﬁlter tip with a (non-ﬁltered) P10 tip on top for ≥10 times every 3–5 min to aid
 disruption of the organoids. Monitor digestion closely to keep the incubation time in TrypLE to a
 minimum. In case of mechanical disruption, resuspend the pellet in 3 ml of adDMEM/F12+++
 medium. Use a P1000 ﬁlter pipette tip with a (non-ﬁltered) P10 tip on top to pipette the organoid
 suspension up and down 30 times. Use the bottom of the tube to create pressure, which will aid
 organoid disruption.
 CRITICAL Do not dissociate in TrypLE for >15 min, as this may result in poor organoid
 c


 outgrowth or even loss of the culture. As a rule of thumb, digestion is complete if a mixture of small
 clumps of cells (consisting of 2–10 cells) can be observed.
 CRITICAL In case of preparation for drug screening, incomplete digestion resulting in big clumps
 c


 of cells or pieces of organoid that are left intact will result in a small yield at the collection of
 organoids, as these will be ﬁltered out during the preparation of the organoid suspension for
 drug screening.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 21 After shearing is complete, wash with 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium.

NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 15 | OCTOBER 2020 | 3380–3409 | www.nature.com/nprot 3397

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 22 Resuspend the organoid pellet in 70% (vol/vol) BME, and plate organoids in small droplets on the
 bottom of a pre-warmed culture plate as described in Steps 10–13. After plating is complete, invert
 the plate and place it in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2 for 30–60 min.
 23 Pre-warm organoid medium containing 10 µM ROCK inhibitor at 37 °C.
 24 After BME drops have solidiﬁed (30–60 min), carefully pipette pre-warmed medium into the wells.
 CRITICAL Make sure to not pipette the medium directly onto the BME drops, as this will disrupt


 c
 the drops.
 25 Place culture plates in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2 until the organoids are
 needed for the drug screen.


 (Optional) Freezing of organoids ● Timing 30 min–1 h
 CRITICAL Organoids do not have to be frozen prior to drug screening and can be used immediately
 c


 by proceeding directly from Step 25 to Step 43.
 26 2–3 d after splitting, remove the medium, and add 500 µl of adDMEM/F12+++ medium into each
 well. Break up the BME drops using a P1000 ﬁlter tip, and transfer the material to an ice-cold 15-ml
 conical tube.
 CRITICAL To ensure removal of BME by washing, a maximum of 12 wells of a 24-well cell
 c


 culture plate should be pooled in a 15-ml conical tube. If more material is used, use multiple tubes
 per culture, which can be pooled later in the process of preparing the organoids for screening.
 27 (Optional) If you are freezing more wells or several cell culture plates, adjust the number of 15-ml
 conical tubes accordingly.
 28 (Optional) If there are large amounts of BME, ﬁll up the 15-ml conical tubes containing the
 organoids to a total volume of 12 ml with ice-cold adDMEM/F12+++ medium, pipette up and
 down with a pre-wetted (using adDMEM/F12+++) 10-ml serological pipette and put the tube on
 ice for 10 min. Pipette up and down again several times with a 10-ml serological pipette. Leaving
 the sample on ice longer will further dissolve the BME.
 29 Centrifuge the organoids at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C.
 30 Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.
 31 (Optional) If multiple 15-ml conical tubes were used to collect one organoid culture, resuspend the
 pellet of each 15-ml conical tube in 1 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium, and transfer them all into
 a 15-ml conical tube. Centrifuge the organoids again at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C, and aspirate the
 supernatant without disturbing the pellet.
 32 Add the required volume of cell-freezing medium, and pipette up and down using a P1000 pipette
 to properly resuspend the organoids.
 CRITICAL 500 μl of freezing medium should be used for four ‘original’ wells with organoids of a
 c


 24-well cell culture plate.
 33 Per sterile cryogenic vial, add 500 µl of freezing medium with the resuspended organoids.
 34 Place the cryogenic vial into a freezing container. Store the freezing container with the samples
 at –80 °C.
 35 After storage at –80 °C for 24 h, remove the vials from the freezing container, and transfer them to
 the liquid nitrogen tank (approximately –180 °C).
 PAUSE POINT Cryopreserved organoids can be stored in the liquid nitrogen tank for
 j


 several years.


 (Optional) Thawing of cryopreserved organoids ● Timing 1 h
 36 Collect the cryogenic vial with the cryopreserved organoids from the liquid nitrogen tank on
 dry ice.
 37 Per cryogenic vial to be thawed, prepare a 15-ml conical tube with 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++
 medium at room temperature.
 38 To thaw the freezing medium with the organoids, incubate the cryogenic vial for 1–3 min in a water
 bath at 37 °C.
 CRITICAL Carefully monitor the thawing, and remove the cryogenic vial from the water bath as
 c


 soon as the freezing medium has thawed. To allow for the time required to walk to the culture hood,
 taking the vial out of the waterbath when a small clump of ice is still present can be considered.
 39 Add 1 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium dropwise into the cryogenic vial while mixing, and then
 transfer the entire volume with the organoids in the vial to a 15-ml conical tube. Fill the tube with
 adDMEM/F12+++ medium to a total volume of 10 ml.

 42 Follow Steps 22–25, as described above.
 CRITICAL If, since this is dependent on the volume of thawed organoids, the freezing medium


 c
 was not diluted at least 10 times during washing, an additional wash step should be performed to
 ensure sufﬁcient dilution of the freezing medium before plating.


 Preparation of organoid solution for dispensation into screening plates ● Timing day
 3, 1.5 h
 CRITICAL Before you start screening, the tumor status of the cells should be conﬁrmed (e.g., by DNA
 c

 sequencing) to ensure that tumor cells (and not normal epithelial cells) are maintained in culture.
 43 Split organoids 2 d before the start of the screen as previously described in Steps 17–25 (Table 2).
 44 Check organoids using a microscope to assess the quality of the culture and exclude the possibility
 of culture contamination before commencing organoid preparation.
 45 Add 1 mg/ml dispase II to the culture medium in each well, and disrupt BME droplets using a
 P1000 pipette. Place the plate back in the incubator for 40 min.
 46 After 40 min, collect the content of the wells, and pipette up and down 10 times to facilitate
 disintegration of the BME. Top up with 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium per 2 ml of collected
 organoid suspension, resuspend using the pre-wetted 10-ml serological pipette and centrifuge.
 47 Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium.
 CRITICAL If a less dense, glass-like pellet is observed on top of the cell pellet, this means that the
 c


 removal of the BME was not complete. Washing with ice-cold adDMEM/F12+++ medium should
 be repeated until the BME is removed. Keep the tube on ice for 10 min between washes, and pipette
 up and down 10 times using a 10-ml serological pipette before centrifugation.
 48 Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium, and ﬁlter the organoid suspension
 using a 70-µm cell strainer. Transfer the ﬁltered solution back to a 15-ml conical tube, and
 spin down.
 49 Resuspend the pellet in adDMEM/F12+++ medium (1–10 ml depending on the size of the pellet),
 and transfer 10 µl of the organoid solution to a disposable counting chamber. Count organoids,
 transfer the required amount of total organoid solution to a new 15-ml conical tube and spin down.
 CRITICAL Before the sample for counting is taken, ensure that the organoid solution is homogenized
 c


 well and that no clumps of the pellet remain in solution. This is essential to obtain a correct estimation
 of the total orgnaoid number after counting. To ensure proper resuspension of the organoid pellet, it
 can ﬁrst be resuspended in 1 mL adDMEM/F12+++ using a P1000 pipette. Once resuspended, the
 additional volume of adDMEM/F12+++ can be added using a serological pipette.
 50 Resuspend the pellet in complete organoid medium containing 5% (vol/vol) BME. For this, ﬁrst
 resuspend the pellet with a P200 pipette in a small volume of the 5% (vol/vol) BME/organoid
 medium solution to ensure that the pellet is nicely resuspended. Subsequently, top up with the
 remaining volume of the mixture of medium and BME.


 Dispensation of organoids into 384-well drug-screening plates ● Timing day 3, 20 min
 CRITICAL To dispense organoids, we use Thermo Scientiﬁc’s Multidrop Combi reagent dispenser.
 c


 However, comparable machines can, of course, also be used.
 51 Wash the tubing of the dispenser according to the manufacturer’s instructions. When using the Thermo
 system, start by washing the tubes with MilliQ water, followed by a wash with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol
 solution. Wash once with PBS. Subsequently, wash again with PBS from a clean 50-ml conical tube. In
 general, clean tubes ﬁlled with solutions should be used only once, to prevent ‘contamination’ from
 previous wash steps being passed on to the next washing solution. A ‘wash’ is deﬁned as ﬂushing a
 minimum of twice the tube volume of liquid per tube through the tubing. Do not let the tubing dry after
 priming with PBS or medium, since the salts in the solution will form crystals in the tubes.
 CRITICAL Tubing should be calibrated before usage, according to the manufacturer’s
 c


 instructions. Calibrate at least every 3 months, although we recommend checking if calibration
 is still accurate before each screen to minimize variation in the assay plate.
 52 Before priming with organoids, ﬂush the tubing at least once with ice-cold adDMEM/F12+++
 medium.
 53 Invert Falcon tubes with organoid suspension to ensure that the organoid solution is
 homogeneously distributed (organoids will sink to the bottom of the tube if left standing still).

NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 15 | OCTOBER 2020 | 3380–3409 | www.nature.com/nprot 3399

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 After ensuring a homogeneous distribution, prime the tubing with organoids until the solution has
 completely passed through the tubing.
 54 Start the program to dispense the organoid solution into a black-/clear-bottom ultra-low
 attachment 384-well cell culture plate. Our setting is a 384-well cell culture plate format, with 40 µl
 per well.
 CRITICAL Make sure that the protocol is started as quickly as possible after priming is complete;


 c
 otherwise, organoids will sink to the bottom of the tube and will not be homogeneously dispensed
 over the culture plate. To ensure homogeneous distribution of organoids, the stock organoid
 solution can be pipetted up and down during dispensing using a serological pipette. However, be
 careful not to introduce air in the dispenser tubing if taking this approach.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 55 (Optional) If GR metrics are the viability measure of choice, cell viability of untreated cells will need
 to be determined on day 3. To set up this assay, in addition to plating in the screening plate
 (Step 54), dispense organoids (40 µl per well, a minimum of three wells) in a separate plate, and
 immediately perform a readout as described in Steps 75–79 using CellTiter-Glo 3D reagent. Store
 the raw data that are obtained, as these will be used during the data analysis once the drug screen
 has been completed.
 56 After organoids have been dispensed, conﬁrm a homogeneous distribution of organoids in the
 drug-screening plate using a microscope. We recommend taking brightﬁeld images of
 representative wells on this day of the assay. Place the screening plate in a humidiﬁed incubator
 at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2.
 57 Clean the dispenser according to the manufacturer’s instructions. When using the Thermo system,
 ﬁrst eject the remaining organoid suspension. Perform a wash with MilliQ water, followed by a
 wash with 1% Micro-90 soap solution (provided with the machine) and 10% (wt/vol) chloride
 solution. Finish cleaning by washing twice with MilliQ water. For these last two washes, use
 separate 50-ml conical tubes that are ﬁlled with water, to prevent ‘contamination’ from the previous
 washing solution being passed to the solution that is subsequently used for washing. A ‘wash’ is
 deﬁned as ﬂushing a minimum of twice the tube volume of liquid per tube through the tubing. Do
 not let the tubing dry after priming with PBS or medium, since the salts in the solution will form
 crystals in the tubes. Ensure proper cleaning, as tubes get easily clogged.


 Addition of chemotherapeutics into the culture plate ● Timing day 3, 20–30 min
 CRITICAL We use the Tecan D300e digital dispenser for the addition of drugs. However, comparable
 c


 machines can also be used. If desired, the drug distribution layout can be generated before the start of
 the experiment to decrease the time between dispensation of organoids and addition of drugs.
 58 Open a new plate layout using the provided software (if using the HP d300e, use the corresponding
 d300e software).
 59 Select the desired plate type (384-well cell culture plate), and set additional volume to 40 µl (top
 right above culture plate layout when using the HPd300e; Supplementary Fig. 1a).
 60 Add all the compounds that will be used in the drug screen to the program, with their
 corresponding concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Do not exceed 10 mM as a stock
 concentration for any of the drugs used (following the drug dispenser protocol). For drugs dissolved
 in PBS or water, add soap to the stock to ensure that they dispense correctly. Use an appropriate
 amount to give an end concentration of 0.3% (vol/vol) Tween-20 in your stock.
 61 Create the screening layout containing the drug gradients by placing concentration gradients of the
 desired drugs in the screening plate layout (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Include technical replicates (we
 recommend a minimum of three replicates per plate). For drugs that we have tested, an overview of
 the concentration ranges used for HNSCC organoids is provided as an example in Table 3.
 CRITICAL Do not use the outer edges of the plate, as evaporation might create an edge effect and
 c


 introduce bias in your plate.
 CRITICAL Optimal concentration ranges will differ per therapy tested, which should be determined
 c


 before screening. Keep in mind the guidelines regarding the number and range of concentrations36,86.
 62 Include the positive control (1–10 µM staurosporin) in at least triplicate in the plate layout
 (Supplementary Fig. 1d).
 63 When ﬁnished, select all the wells that will be included in the screen, plus the wells that will not be
 exposed to drugs but will serve as negative controls, and press ‘Normalization’ to ensure that total
 solvent volume will be equal in all wells (Supplementary Fig. 1e).

 the total well volume, as in our experience, exceeding these concentrations will result in cell death.
 Use as high a stock volume of drug as possible, to minimize the addition of solvent solution
 (Supplementary Fig. 1e).
 CRITICAL Ensure that each plate has a minimum of three wells that can serve as negative
 c


 controls. Ideally, distribute these in different places in the plate to prevent local effects inﬂuencing
 the outcome of the plate.
 CRITICAL Be aware that separate negative controls need to be established for drugs dissolved in
 c


 DMSO and for those dissolved in PBS/Tween-20. Alternatively, all wells of the entire screen can be
 normalized with both solvents. However, be aware that, depending on the volumes added, this
 might negatively affect cell viability and thus requires testing before screening.
 64 Save the program (Supplementary Fig. 1f).
 65 Switch on the drug dispenser and press ‘RUN’. The volumes of drug stocks required will be shown.
 For drugs dissolved in PBS or water, take the volume required plus 5% extra, and add Tween-20 to
 a ﬁnal concentration of 0.3%. Use immediately, and dispose of the remaining stock.
 CRITICAL Do not store a drug stock once 0.3% Tween-20 has been added, as long-term storage
 c


 in the presence of soap may interfere with drug effects (e.g., we have noticed this when using
 antibodies). Therefore, always add soap fresh to the drug stock, and use only the volume of drug
 stock that will be required for that particular screen.
 66 When all stocks are thawed and ready (and Tween-20 added where required), run the program (by
 pressing ‘START’) to dispense the drugs in the organoid plate.
 67 Once completed, place the culture plate in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2. A
 report ﬁle in .xls format will automatically be generated when a protocol is completed. This ﬁle
 contains all the information (including dispensed concentrations) of all the drugs dispensed and
 can be used during data analysis.
 68 If you wish to combine drug treatment with radiotherapy, continue to Step 69 of this protocol. If
 not, leave the plate for 5 d until readout, and move on to Step 75 of the protocol. During this
 incubation, we recommend the use of Breathe-Easy sealing membranes rather than plate lids, to
 prevent evaporation during incubation. This has been shown to decrease assay variability69.
 CRITICAL Try to avoid opening the incubator during incubation with the drugs to ensure
 c


 optimal conditions for drug-screening plates (for example, use a separate incubator for these plates
 that is not used for ‘regular’ tissue culture). Do not stack drug-screening plates; instead, keep them
 all at the bottom of a shelf and in the back of the incubator to keep conditions as constant and
 comparable between different plates as possible.


 (Optional stage) Irradiation of organoids in 384-well cell culture plate format
 ● Timing day 4, 10–20 min
 ! CAUTION Studies involving a radioactive source such as a gamma irradiator may require prior
 approval and must conform to all relevant institutional and governmental regulations.
 CRITICAL Radiotherapy is usually applied on the day after the addition of chemotherapeutic agents to
 c


 the screening plate. In chemoradiotherapy, the chemotherapy acts as a radiosensitizer and should

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 therefore enhance the effect of radiotherapy on the cells. To translate this to an in vitro test, we include a
 24-h chemotherapy incubation before application of radiotherapy. The 24-h incubation works well for
 the combination of radiotherapy with the drugs that we have tested (cisplatin, carboplatin and
 cetuximab). This window might need to be changed for other drugs of interest.
 69 Set the radiation machine to the desired radiation dose (e.g., 2 Gy when combined with
 chemotherapy).
 70 Cover the edges of the plate with Paraﬁlm to prevent water from entering the culture plate.
 Preferably, Breathe-Easy sealing membranes are used to cover the plates (see Step 68). If these are
 used, Paraﬁlm is not required.
 71 Transfer the Paraﬁlm-wrapped plate to a box ﬁlled with tap water at room temperature. The water
 level should be the highest it can be without covering the plate. For this step, the sealing membranes
 (described in Steps 68 and 70) are very convenient because they provide another barrier to keep
 water from entering the plate wells.
 72 Place the box under the radiation beam, and make sure that the beam will be aimed at the center of
 the culture plate.
 73 Leave the room, and irradiate the plate.
 CRITICAL Irradiate only one plate at a time, and do not irradiate stacks of plates, as equal
 c


 distribution of radiation cannot be ensured.
 74 Remove the Paraﬁlm, and use a paper tissue to dry the culture plate. Place the plate back in the
 incubator until the day of the readout.

 Cell-viability readout of drug-screening plates ● Timing day 7, 45 min
 75 Thaw CellTiter-Glo 3D reagent in a water bath at 37 °C for 15 min (until completely thawed). Try
 to prevent freeze–thaw cycles of CellTiter-Glo 3D reagent, for example, by preparing aliquots of the
 reagent that can be used to perform the readout on one plate.
 76 Use your dispenser (the same machine that was used for organoid dispensation is used here) to add
 40 µl of CellTiter-Glo 3D reagent to each well of the drug-screening plate.
 CRITICAL CellTiter-Glo 3D reagent will lyse the cells; thus, if image collection is part of the readout,
 c


 do this before the addition of CellTiter-Glo 3D reagent to the culture plate. We recommend taking
 brightﬁeld images of representative wells (control, drug of interest), as noted in Step 56.
 77 Shake the plate for 5 min using the dispensing machine.
 CRITICAL Shaking on a regular plate shaker will not result in mixing of the content of the 384-
 c


 well cell culture plate, because of the small area. Therefore, shakers adapted for this plate format are
 required.
 78 Incubate the assay plate for 15 min at room temperature.
 79 Perform the readout by measuring the luminescence intensity of each well. We use the Tecan Spark
 multimode microplate reader for this, but, of course, comparable machines can also be used.
 Luminescence should be measured for 500 ms per well. If the signal is low, longer detecting times
 can be used.

 Analysis of drug-screening results ● Timing day 7 or later, 45 min
 CRITICAL We describe how to use Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism. These instructions can be
 c


 adapted for use with other software.
 80 Collect both the raw luminescence detecting data and the drug screen layout in Microsoft Excel
 (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
 81 Calculate the average luminescence value of the negative and positive control wells of the drug
 screen plate (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Be aware that, when different normalization reagents are used
 for different drugs used in the same plate, separate negative controls should be used.
 82 Calculate the Z-factor of each drug-screening plate using the following formula:

 3  standard deviationðnegative controlÞ þ 3  standard deviationð positive controlÞ
 Z factor ¼ 1 
 averageðnegative controlÞ  averageð positive controlÞ


 The Z-factor expresses the technical noise in a plate to the total range of values obtained between
 positive and negative controls. Therefore, the Z-factor can be used as an indication of screening
 quality. As a rule of thumb, use data only if the obtained Z-factor is >0.4. Organoid screens often
 show Z-factors of ≥0.7 (Supplementary Fig. 2c).

 83 Set the positive control to 0% viability, and deﬁne the negative (vehicle only) control as 100% by
 calculating viability for each well as follows:

 ðwell value  average positive controlÞ
 well viability ¼  100%
 average vehicle control  average positive control

 (Supplementary Fig. 2d).
 84 To visualize the data, transfer results to software such as GraphPad Prism (Supplementary Fig. 3).
 For this, generate a new Prism ﬁle containing an XY table and graph, and select the appropriate
 number of replicates (Supplementary Fig. 3b).
 85 Load data into Prism (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Transfer the viability percentages of all individual
 wells to the newly generated Prism table. Add the log-transformed drug concentrations in the ﬁrst
 row of the table.
 86 Set graph parameters (Supplementary Fig. 3c) by selecting the appropriate graph type (XY), setting
 error bars (we use s.e.m.) and setting graph origin (we use lower left).
 87 Add a trendline to the newly generated graph (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Choose the option ‘log
 (inhibitor) vs normalized response -variable slope’ to create a kill curve.
 88 Compare different organoid lines by comparing IC50 values (Supplementary Fig. 3e) or AUC,
 depending on the shape of the kill curve. For some compounds (such as the anti-EGFR antibody
 cetuximab), kill curves do not show a sigmoid shape, which makes the calculation of IC50 values
 difﬁcult. In that case, AUC values allow comparison between different lines.
 89 To calculate AUC, select AUC calculation in the ‘Analysis’ tab (Supplementary Fig. 3f). (Optional)
 Alternatively, if a day 3 measurement is performed (see optional Step 55, measuring ATP values of
 untreated organoids at the start of therapy exposure), GR metrics can be calculated instead or in
 addition to IC50/AUC values. GR metrics correct for proliferation rate, thereby generally resulting
 in more reproducible sensitivity measurements36. Calculation of these metrics cannot be performed
 in GraphPad Prism and requires an analysis as described elsewhere36. Differences between IC50,
 AUC and GR metrics are discussed in more depth in Anticipated results and discussion.

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 from patients diagnosed with HNSCC. Before we implemented the addition of caspofungin to the
 culture medium of primary cultures, organoid cultures were regularly lost by fungal infections that
 occurred mainly in laryngeal and pharyngeal biopsies (even when cultured in medium containing
 both penicillin-streptomycin and Primocin), decreasing the outgrowth efﬁciency.
 We have not yet found an effective method for inducing organoid outgrowth from the remaining
 30% of samples. There are various possible reasons for lack of organoid outgrowth from this subset of
 samples, including suboptimal sampling, insufﬁcient monitoring of primary cultures, suboptimal
 seeding density, absence of culture medium components that might be required for a subset of tumors
 such as conditioned media (when used) or speciﬁcities of the samples (such as donating patients who
 were treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy shortly before sampling). To make sampling as
 efﬁcient as possible, a quick transfer of patient material into the collection culture medium is advised
 (see Step 1). This will prevent the tissue from drying out and will probably result in more efﬁcient
 outgrowth. Therefore, when setting up organoid cultures in a new hospital or institute, it is important
 to integrate sample collection as efﬁciently as possible into the hospital logistics. In addition, sampling
 from viable, epithelial-rich tumor areas (no necrotic or ﬁbrotic areas) will increase the chance of
 successful organoid establishment (see Step 2). After initial plating, we recommend the organoid
 culture be monitored daily. In some cases, the BME is dissolved overnight after plating primary tissue,
 resulting in release of epithelial cells/clumps of cells from the ECM. If left unattended, the epithelial
 cells will not grow out into organoids and will eventually die. In these cases, collection of material
 from the culture plate, washing, centrifuging and replating in fresh BME solved the problem.


 Linking in vitro organoid drug-screening results with clinical data
 Using the drug-screening approach described in this article, the response to a range of therapeutic
 agents can be determined for organoids derived from different donors. This has allowed us to
 compare the drug responses between cells derived from different patients. Depending on the therapy
 used, IC50 values (Fig. 3e and f), AUC values or GR metrics can be used to quantify drug responses
 and thereby allow the comparison between different lines. In the data presented here, for example, it
 was found that the organoid lines derived from donor A tissue was much more sensitive to the
 PIK3CA-inhibitor alpelisib than the organoid line derived from donor M tissue.
 Others have already shown that, in some tumor types, organoid responses in vitro can predict
 patient clinical responses. A study published in 2018 revealed a correlation between organoid and
 clinical response in colorectal cancer patients30. A more recent study conﬁrmed that organoids have
 predictive potential in this patient group. Interestingly, this study indicated that organoids could
 predict the response to irinotecan-based therapy, but not to 5-ﬂuorouracil plus oxaliplatin32. The
 authors additionally proposed that responders could still be distinguished from non-responders when
 using fewer cells than they used. This would enable screening results to be obtained in only 2 weeks,
 making such an assay suitable for clinical implementation. It will be interesting to see if the con-
 ditions deﬁned for their minimized assay can be validated in an independent data set.
 Similar results have been obtained for organoids derived from pancreatic and breast cancers,
 although with much smaller patient cohorts9,11. In our recent publication, we show that the response
 of HNSCC-derived organoids to radiotherapy was predictive of patient response to this treatment
 (although numbers were small)19. The observed correlation between organoid and patient response
 requires validation in larger patient cohorts. Nonetheless, if this holds true, patient-derived organoids
 may have application in personalized medicine to select the right drug for the right patient. Such a
 functional selection of effective therapies for the individual patient is desired, since many new
 targeted agents are currently in clinical trial. Organoids could thus serve both as a tool to identify
 responders and as a tool to identify or validate potential biomarkers, by comparing responder and
 non-responder organoid cultures, respectively.


 Challenges for the future: determining the predictive potential of organoids
 It remains to be determined whether in vitro sensitivity to a drug is actually predictive of a clinical
 response of the patient to that same drug. Recent data suggest that this might actually vary depending
 on the therapy tested32. Currently, we are awaiting more studies that investigate the predictive
 potential of organoids. It will be of interest to see how this ﬁeld develops over the coming years. As
 previously discussed, the variability in screening setup, diversity of therapies tested and variability in
 clinical parameters available to assess clinical responses complicate the comparison of different
 studies. To further characterize tumor-speciﬁc sensitivities to drugs and possible adverse effects on

 healthy tissue, one may also consider incorporating patient-matched normal organoids into the drug
 screenings19. However, normal organoid cultures may be rather heterogeneous with respect to the
 ratio of stem cells to differentiated cells and also display a high expansion rate, as most normal
 organoid growth media favor an undifferentiated and proliferative state of the cultures. Therefore, the
 response of wild-type organoids to chemotherapeutics targeting proliferating cells (i.e., not targeted
 therapies that should affect only cells carrying speciﬁc tumor-speciﬁc genetic alterations) may not
 always be indicative of the response of healthy tissues in vivo.
 If organoid drug screens are introduced in the future to guide clinical decision making, the quality
 of the drug-screening assays used for this need to be ensured. Internal controls are essential to be
 conﬁdent screening results are reproducible over time. Previous work has shown that drug responses
 in HNSCC-derived organoids were reproducible when repeated 3 months apart19. For example, a
 control organoid for which the response to the therapeutic agents tested is already known could be
 used as a control on each plate. To systematically test the quality of each individual assay plate, Z-
 factor scores should be calculated. Z-factor scores are a measure of assay quality, where a higher score
 indicates a more robust assay. Only plates with a Z-factor above a certain cutoff value would then be
 included. Generally, a cutoff value of 0.4 is used. In our previous screenings, we have obtained an
 average of Z-factor scores of 0.719, indicating that drug screening in patient-derived organoids is
 robust and could potentially be further optimized to meet clinical standards. Studies of screening
 optimization have given valuable insights for screening optimization, including the use of plate seals
 to prevent edge effects69. Such alterations might further improve assay robustness and thereby aid
 implementation of organoid therapy screens in clinical decision making. Although beyond the scope
 of this article, these questions need to be addressed in the future and will require standardization of
 assays and culture conditions for patient-derived materials that meet European Medicines
 Agency and US Food and Drug Administration standards, if organoid-based screens are introduced
 into the clinic.
