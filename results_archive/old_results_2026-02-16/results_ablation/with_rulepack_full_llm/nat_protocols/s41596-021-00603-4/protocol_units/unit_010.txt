38 Tune the Helios mass cytometer (see Equipment setup). 39 Centrifuge cells at 800g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant. 40 Wash the cells with 2 ml of of 2 mM EDTA/CSB, centrifuge at 800g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant. 41 Wash cells with 2 ml of CSB, centrifuge at 800g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant. 42 Wash cells with 2 ml of MaxPar water, centrifuge at 800g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant. 43 Resuspend cells in 1 ml of MaxPar water, ﬁlter through a 35‑µm cell strainer (70 µm when the culture contains ﬁbroblasts) and count the cells by using a Countess II automated cell counter. 44 Dilute cells to ~0.8–1.2 × 10^6/ml in MaxPar water. 45 Add EQ beads to the cell suspension at a volumetric ratio of 1:5. 46 Add EDTA to the cells to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 mM. 47 Set up the ‘Super Sampler’ (Victorian Airships) as per the manufacturer’s instructions, and set up acquisition parameters (e.g., antibody panel and experiment metadata) on the Helios mass cytometer. 48 Acquire events on the Helios mass cytometer by using the Fluidigm CyTOF software. Aim for 100–400 events/s. 49 After all events are acquired, process the raw data by using the Fluidigm CyTOF software as per Fluidigm’s recommendation (i.e., signal normalization, removal of EQ beads and concatenation of data files if needed). Export data as FCS file(s).
