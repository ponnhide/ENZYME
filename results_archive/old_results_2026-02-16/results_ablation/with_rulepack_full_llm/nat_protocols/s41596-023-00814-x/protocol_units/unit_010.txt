35 Culture neurospheres in a spinner flask (option A) or in Petri dishes (option B)
(A) Spinner flask culture
(i) Prepare fresh OVB organoid medium and fill 100 ml into a 250 ml spinner flask and transfer the spinner flask to an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for at least 30 min to pre‑warm. Do not culture more than 80 neurospheres per 100 ml.
(ii) Place the spinner flask under the sterile hood and open one of the side arms.
(iii) Cut the pipette tip of a 1,000 µl micropipette with sterile scissors and carefully transfer neurospheres from the Petri dish into the spinner flask, plunge the micropipette into the spinner flask through a side‑arm of the bottle and place neurospheres into the medium.
(iv) Close the bottle and place it on the stirring platform in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.
(v) Perform half‑medium changes weekly. Place the bottle under the sterile hood, let the organoids settle for 3 min and then carefully aspirate 50 ml of medium without disturbing the organoids. Next, add 50 ml of fresh OVB organoid medium pre‑warmed in a 37 °C water bath.
