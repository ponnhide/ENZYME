9 For dose‑dependent light sensitivity, expose each organoid to 500 ms long flashes. Start with a low intensity of 2,000 mlux (moonlight on a clear night), increase to 20,000 mlux (candle light) and then to 200,000 mlux (daylight on a cloudy day). Repeat each intensity three times at 3 min intervals, and then switch to the next higher light intensity.
10 If OVB organoids show dose‑dependent responses to different light stimulation, you can continue with the photic stress experiment. Keep the superfusion speed at 0.5 ml/min.
