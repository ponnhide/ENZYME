38 At this point, it is desirable to immunostain and image the organoids for the forebrain patterning and eye field specification markers. In our case, we used labeled FOXG1, PAX6 and SOX2 regions as the forebrain patterning molecules and RAX and VSX2 regions as the primitive eye field region.
41 (Optional) At this point, it is desirable to conduct a tracing experiment by injecting fluorescently tagged Cholera toxin followed by tissue clearing and imaging as described previously5,10,52. This will reveal the bilaterality and visual projections into the brain tissue of an organoid.
