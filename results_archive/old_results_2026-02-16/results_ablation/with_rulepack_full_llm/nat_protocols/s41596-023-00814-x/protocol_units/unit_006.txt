4 Add 2 ml of Accutase containing 0.2 U/µl DNase I (prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath), close the tube tightly and incubate at 37 °C in a water bath.
5 Check after 15 min for dissociation of organoids by shaking the tube and watching the integrity of organoids. Place the tube under a sterile hood and dissociate organoids by pipetting up and down with an uncut 1,000 µl micropipette tip.
6 Place the tube back into a water bath and incubate for another 15 min at 37 °C.
7 Repeat step 5.
8 Place tube back and incubate for another 15 min at 37 °C. Do not exceed 45 min of Accutase treatment in total, since this would lead to too high a portion of dead cells and might decrease the success of the further procedure.
