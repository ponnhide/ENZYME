78. Transfer each cell‑RNP mixture (25 μl) to each well of the Nucleocuvette strips. Click the lid tight.
79. Gently tap the strip on the benchtop to make sure that the sample covers the bottom of the cuvette and that there are no bubbles in the wells.
80. Place the Nucleocuvette strips with closed lid into the retainer of the 4D‑Nucleofector X unit. Check for proper orientation of the Nucleocuvette strips.
81. Start the nucleofection process by using the CA137 program.
▲ CRITICAL STEP Nucleofection efficiency and cell survival rate differ greatly when using different nucleofection programs. We tested multiple nucleofection programs and found that the current program resulted in high nucleofection efficiency and minimal cell death. Optimize nucleofection programs on the basis of specific cell types.
82. After run completion, carefully remove the Nucleocuvette strips from the retainer. Add 70 μl of pre‑warmed E8 supplemented with 10 μM Y‑27632 to resuspend the cells. Mix the cells by gently pipetting up and down two to three times.
83. Add 5 μl of the cell suspension to one well and the rest to another well of a six‑well plate.
▲ CRITICAL STEP Seed the desired number of cells according to your experiment. We seed 5 μl of the cell suspension into a single well of a six‑well plate, achieving confluency after 4 d of culture, allowing for passaging or hiPS cell aggregation. Any extra cells can be seeded in another well and frozen for future use.
84. Change to E8 medium without Y‑27632 the next day.
