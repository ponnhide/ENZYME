Our protocol for pooled CRISPR screening in neural organoids and assembloids can be divided into five sections (Fig. 2a,b). Section 1 begins with the transduction of hiPS cells by using lentivirus carrying sgRNAs, which also encodes mCherry to label infected cells, followed by the maintenance of transduced hiPS cells to achieve gene perturbation. This is followed by section 2, which describes the generation of hSO from genetically modified hiPS cells. We also provide details on the generation of hCO for use in the migration screen. Section 3 describes steps for isolating cells from parallel screens for interneuron generation and migration. This involves the use of engineered hiPS cells to stably express eGFP under the control of a previously validated Dlxi1/2b enhancer, which labels ganglionic eminence-derived cells5,17. Section 4 covers sequencing and data analysis to curate a list of candidate genes. Finally, section 5 details the functional validation of gene hits.
