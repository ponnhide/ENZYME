This is followed by section 2, which describes the generation of hSO from genetically modified hiPS cells. We also provide details on the generation of hCO for use in the migration screen. Section 3 describes steps for isolating cells from parallel screens for interneuron generation and migration. This involves the use of engineered hiPS cells to stably express eGFP under the control of a previously validated Dlxi1/2b enhancer, which labels ganglionic eminence-derived cells5,17.

Transfer one hCO and one hSO into the same well of a 24-well low-attachment plate by using the P1000 pipette tips with wide orifice. Fill each well with 2 ml of NM. Tilt the plate slightly to guide both organoids toward the edge of the well. Using a P20 pipette tip, gently position the hCO and hSO so that they are in contact with each other (Fig. 3f).\n41.
