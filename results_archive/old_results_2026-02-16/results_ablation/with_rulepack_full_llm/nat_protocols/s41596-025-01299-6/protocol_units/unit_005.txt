Day 45: dissociating hSO and sorting Dlxi1/2b::GFP+ and Dlxi1/2b::GFP− cells
● TIMING 8 h
30. Pool 12 organoids into one well of a six-well plate along with 3 ml of enzyme solution with papain (10 U ml−1). Incubate the plate with organoids at 37 °C for 15 min in a 5% CO2 incubator. Gently shake the plate horizontally every 5 min to evenly distribute the papain solution. Both control and genetically perturbed hSO should be dissociated at this step, because control (uninfected) cells will be needed to set the gate for FACS.
▲ CRITICAL STEP Mix the enzyme solution with the appropriate amount of papain and pre-warm the mixed solution at 37 °C for 20 min before dissociation of the organoids to activate the enzyme. The concentration of papain and incubation time are critical for the yield of the dissociation. Optimize these parameters if working with a different type of organoids or organoids at a different stage of differentiation.
▲ CRITICAL STEP The protocol described here is for dissociation of an individual sample consisting of 12 organoids. The yield does not increase linearly with more starting materials. We pool 12 organoids as one sample for this step.
