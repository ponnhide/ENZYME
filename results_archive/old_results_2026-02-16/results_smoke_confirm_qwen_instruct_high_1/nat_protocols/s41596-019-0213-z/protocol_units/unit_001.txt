1 Wash hPSCs with 0.5 mM EDTA by removing E8 medium and replacing it with 0.6 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA per well of a 6-well plate.
2 Aspirate the EDTA solution, add 0.6 mL of Accutase per well and incubate for 3–5 min at 37 °C.
Closely monitor cells under the tissue culture microscope until the cells start to round up.
3 Dissociate the cells from the plate with a P1000 pipette and pipette the cells gently up and down
(2–3×) to break up aggregates and to generate single cells.
CRITICAL STEP Do not pipette the cells more than 2–3×, because single hPSCs are sensitive to
mechanical stress.
4 Resuspend the cells in 5 mL of aggregation medium using a 5-mL serological pipette and collect the
cells in a 15-mL Falcon tube.
5 For cell counting, mix 10 μL of cell suspension and 10 μL of 0.1% Trypan blue solution (included
with the counting chamber slides) and pipette 10 μL of the mixture onto a counting chamber slide.
Mix the cell suspension thoroughly before taking the counting aliquot to achieve accurate and
consistent cell number measurements.
6 Count viable cells using an automated cell counter or under a microscope.

7 Calculate the cell suspension volume needed for the experiment (2 × 105 cells per well).
CRITICAL STEP The cell number required for aggregate formation varies by hPSC line. For cell
lines that are poor at forming aggregates, the cell number must be adjusted to between 5 × 105 and
1 × 106 cells per well.
8 Centrifuge the cells at 300g for 5 min (22–23 °C) and aspirate the medium.
9 Resuspend the cells in fresh aggregation medium (3 mL per well) containing 50 μM Y-27632.
10 Place 3 mL of cell suspension per well into a 6-well low-attachment plate and incubate for 1 d until
cell aggregates with smooth borders (>50- to 100-µm diameter) have been formed (Fig. 2b).
CRITICAL STEP Efﬁcient aggregate formation is absolutely essential for the success of the
protocol. Aggregation capacity varies between hPSC lines, and thus the incubation time may need
to be adjusted from 1 d to 2 or even 3 d.
11 One day after aggregates have formed (d0), transfer the aggregates to a 15-mL Falcon tube with a
10-mL serological pipette and wait for the aggregates to settle down by gravitation. Do not discard
the 6-well plate; save it for later aggregate replating.
CRITICAL STEP Gentle treatment of aggregates is important. Always collect aggregates by
gravitation. Centrifugation of cell aggregates is not recommended at any point in the protocol.

12 After cell aggregates have collected at the bottom of the 15-mL Falcon tube (this may take
15–20 min), carefully aspirate the medium.
13 Use a 10-mL serological pipette to gently resuspend the aggregates (3 mL per well) in N2B27
medium + 12 µM CHIR99021 + 30 ng/mL BMP-4 and transfer the aggregates back to the
low-attachment plate. Incubate the cells.
14 Use a P1000 pipette to quickly resuspend the aggregates once per day to avoid excessive fusion of
aggregates. Incubate for 3 d to induce mesodermal differentiation.

15 On day 3, transfer the aggregates to a 15-mL tube and wait for them to settle down by gravitation.
Do not discard the 6-well plate; save it for later aggregate replating.
16 After cell aggregates have collected at the bottom of the 15-mL Falcon tube, carefully aspirate the
medium.
17 Resuspend the aggregates (3 mL per well) in N2B27 medium + 100 ng/mL VEGF-A + 2 µM
forskolin and transfer the aggregates back to the low-attachment plates. Incubate for 2 more
days (Fig. 2c).
