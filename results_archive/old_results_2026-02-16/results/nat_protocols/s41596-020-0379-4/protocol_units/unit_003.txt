 screening of patient-derived adult stem cell–based organoids using a quantitative measure to assess
 cell viability after treatment. Additional approaches such as co-cultures of organoids and additional
 (patient-derived) cell types such as immune cells75,76 to study the effect of therapies are, although
 highly relevant, beyond the scope of this paper. Generally, organoids are passaged and given time to
 recover under normal culture conditions. Subsequently, organoids are collected, ﬁltered, counted and
 plated at the desired density and then exposed to the therapy of choice. Readout is—on average—
 performed 5 or 6 d after the start of the treatment, but ranges from 1 to 24 d of exposure to therapy.
 While some groups expose organoids directly after plating in the screening wells11,30,50,52,66, others let
 organoids recover for a number of days before commencing treatment5,9,19,32,39,43,68–70,77. Usually,
 when organoids are plated as single cells, drugs are added 1 d later. Encouragingly, it has been
 reported that the response of organoids to therapy is comparable when exposed to drugs either as
 single cells or multicellular structures43. Most organoid screens have been performed using low
 percentages of BME or Matrigel (ranging from 2% to 10%). However, some have used higher
 percentages of BME or Matrigel (ranging from 50% to 100%)30,53,66,69,70. In these cases, organoids
 were plated in ECM droplets (either on the day of screening or on the day of passage preceding the
 drug exposure). Newly developed ECM hydrogel alternatives to BME or Matrigel such as piglet
 mesenchyme–derived ECM hydrogels78 or fully deﬁned growth factor–free matrices have been
 described for organoid cultures79. Although such alternatives might bring down the cost of high-
 throughput screening, their use to either generate cancer organoids or perform organoid drug screens
 has not been reported to date.

 Experimental design
 Below, we describe the general steps for organoid culture and processing for drug screening. The
 procedure that is described here is suitable for screening organoids that can be passaged at least once
 every 14 d, with a split ratio of 1:2. To make it easier to adapt this protocol to culture different types
 of organoids, we highlight the steps where differences were observed between different published
 protocols, which, for example report on the generation of organoids from a different tissue type.
 Although this protocol describes the generation of HNSCC-derived organoids and their use for drug
 screening, this procedure can be adapted for various other normal or tumor tissue–derived organoids.

 Tissue collection and processing (Steps 1–5)
 Necrotic (tumor) tissue has poor organoid-forming efﬁciency. It is therefore important to obtain
 tissue pieces from viable (tumor) tissue, which is often pink in color, whereas necrotic tissue may
 appear yellowish. During transport to the laboratory, storage of tissue pieces in ice-cold basic medium
 ideally containing 10 µM Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor compound Y-2763 or (less desired) ice-cold
 PBS is essential to minimize cell death and increase organoid outgrowth. Tissue pieces should be
 collected and stored in media as soon as possible, in either the operating room or the pathological
 laboratory. These measures will improve cell viability. Under these conditions, we have succeeded in
 generating organoids from intercontinentally shipped tissue pieces, kept up to 72 h at 4 °C. Organoids
 can be established from cryopreserved tissues, although the efﬁciency of derivation is probably lower
 than that obtained when starting with fresh material.

 Organoid generation from primary tissue (Steps 6–16)
 Protocols to generate organoids from primary patient material are typically divided into several stages
 (we found one exception that did not describe a digestion step53): (i) mechanical fragmentation of
 tissue pieces using a scalpel or razor blades; (ii) digestion of fragments into a single-cell suspension or
 clumps of cells by using enzymes such as collagenase, DNase, dispase, hyaluronidase or trypsin (or its
 replacement enzyme TrypLE), enzyme mixes such as Liberase (an off-the-shelf combination of
 collagenases I and II and thermolysin) or chemicals such as EDTA (sometimes combined with
 trypsin); (iii) plating of cell preparations into drops of an ECM hydrogel such as BME or Matrigel;
 and (iv) culture using growth medium in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2.
 However, depending on the sampled tissue (bladder, colon, head and neck, etc.), the use of normal or
 tumor tissue and the group developing the protocol, the procedures to generate organoids may differ.
 In particular, the type of enzymes or chemicals and their concentrations, the digestion time, the
 resulting cell preparation, the ECM hydrogel, the plating concentration and the medium used may be
 different. We provide an overview of these differences in Table 1. Of the 33 approaches discussed
 here, 29 protocols require collagenase or Liberase, 10 trypsin or TrypLE, 5 hyaluronidase, 3 dispase,

3388 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 15 | OCTOBER 2020 | 3380–3409 | www.nature.com/nprot

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 3 DNase and 3 EDTA (in some studies, combinations of digestion enzymes were used). It is
 important to note that different protocols specify different types of collagenases/hyaluronidase to use
 for digestion. In most cases, digestion is performed at 37 °C in a water bath or an incubator.
 Incubation time ranges from 30 min to overnight digestion. Some protocols describe a regular check
 on the progress of the digestion to avoid overdigestion, as well as frequent shaking of the sample to
 avoid clumping of the cells (DNase may also be added to further minimize the risk of clumping). In
 addition, the ECM hydrogel and growth medium may vary. Yet, in all but one case8, advanced
 DMEM/F12 is used as the basic medium to prepare the complete organoid growth medium.
 Eventual organoid outgrowth efﬁciency is dependent on the quality of the sample obtained and the
 percentage of epithelial tumor cells in the sample30,32,49. Studies showed that the chance of growing
 organoids from any particular sample is, quite intuitively, higher if that sample contains a high
 percentage of tumor cells on pathological assessment. For HNSCC organoids, the outgrowth efﬁ-
 ciency from tumors is ~70% of all fragments plated. From other carcinoma types, organoid cultures
 have been established with success rates between ~60% (breast cancer)9 and >90% (colorectal can-
 cer)39. To increase the chance of optimal organoid formation, we recommend keeping 10 µM
 Y-27632 in the culture medium for the ﬁrst two passages and refreshing the medium every 2–3 d to
 ensure sufﬁcient growth factor concentrations for the cultured cells.
 Organoid cultures should be closely monitored for the ﬁrst few days after plating for potential
 bacterial and fungal infections. If such infections occur, 5 M NaOH (or other suitable disinfectant)
 should immediately be added to the infected wells, they should be left for 1 h and the contents should
 be removed. Washing of the contaminated well after removal of the organoid material plus disin-
 fection with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol and replacing the culture plate lid should minimize the chance of
 the infection spreading to other wells. Regular tests should be performed to ensure the cultures
 remain free of Mycoplasma. Basic growth medium contains the standard cocktail of the antibiotics
 penicillin and streptomycin. For samples taken from microbiome-positive areas such as the colon or
 the oral mucosa, we recommend adding additional antibiotics such as Primocin (for most samples,
 including the colon), vancomycin and gentamicin (in addition to Primocin, when generating orga-
 noids from the colon) and/or caspofungin (in addition to Primocin, when generating organoids from
 the oral mucosa) for the ﬁrst two passages.

 Organoid splitting and passaging (Steps 17–25)
 When using TrypLE digestions for passaging (enzymatic digestion should be used only for compact
 organoids that cannot be passaged using mechanical shearing), closely monitor the digestion process
 after addition of TrypLE to avoid over-digestion. Use a P1000 pipette to aid disruption of the
 organoids during digestion, and check the progress of digestion every 5 min under the microscope.
 Stop digestion when a mixture of small clusters of cells (consisting of three to ﬁve cells) and single
 cells is observed. When working with organoid cultures with cystic or grape-like morphology,
 mechanical shearing may be used instead of TrypLE to passage cultures. Ensure proper outgrowth of
 organoids by adding 10 µM Y-27632 to the culture medium directly after passaging. When the
 medium is refreshed 2–3 d later, this is no longer required.

 Organoid freezing and thawing (Steps 26–42)
 Freezing organoids when they are highly proliferative (usually 2–3 d after passaging) will improve
 their recovery. Freezing single cells is typically associated with reduced organoid recovery after
 thawing. Freezing of large, differentiated organoids usually results in poor recovery as well. Using the
 conditions provided in the protocol below, we have consistently reached a recovery rate of >50% of
 the re-plated organoids. Of note, freezing/thawing may cause changes in organoid morphology on
 recovery and might affect drug screening49. As such, we always recommend a minimum of one
 passage after thawing before organoids are used for drug screening. Additional splits might be
 required for cultures that do not recover well from thawing to get them recovered and ready for
 screening.

 Characterization of organoid cultures (quality control (QC))
 Although validation of the predictive potential of organoids is beyond the scope of this article, this
 protocol does contain QC steps that—in our opinion—are essential before drug screening can be
 performed. These include an assessment of how well the culture at hand recapitulates the tumor
 in vivo, and a validation that samples are matched to the patient from which they were derived. In our

NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 15 | OCTOBER 2020 | 3380–3409 | www.nature.com/nprot 3389

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 opinion, this QC is a requirement before investigating potential correlations between organoid
 responses and DNA alterations/clinical responses detected in the patient.
 Before screening, it is important to assess that the established organoids represent the tumor of the
 patient. Potential contamination with normal cells (present in the resection or biopsy material used to
 establish the culture) should be considered, since this is a notorious problem when establishing
 patient-derived organoid cultures from primary tumor tissue1. To address the tumor purity of the
 culture, the variant allele frequency of mutations detected by bulk DNA sequencing can be used as a
 proxy for the percentage of tumor cells in the culture. To decrease the chances of wild-type con-
 tamination, methods to enrich for tumor cells in culture have been described. Selection with MDM2
 agonist Nutlin-3 has been used to select for TP53 mutant tumor cells in organoids48,80. EGF with-
 drawal has been used to select for RAS mutant (and thus epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-
 signaling independent) tumor cells11,22,39,58,81,82. Lastly, removal of Wnt and/or RSPO and other
 growth factors has allowed the selection of tumor cells with speciﬁc mutations39,49,81,82 and even
 speciﬁc tumor subtypes83. Although useful, the use of such ‘minimal’ medium49 selection should be
 applied with caution, as, most of the time, the genetic background of the tumor is unknown at the
 time of selection, and culture heterogeneity is potentially lost when such selection is applied.
 When organoids are established from metastatic lesions, contamination with normal cells is less
 common. When established from, for example, lymph node biopsies, bone biopsies or ascites ﬂuid, it
 is unlikely that wild-type epithelial cells will be present in the material used to establish a culture.
 Even if organoids can be established from wild-type tissue under the applied medium49 conditions,
 the resulting organoids can likely be discriminated from the tumor organoids based on their mor-
 phology (e.g., cystic liver organoids in a metastatic colorectal cancer culture derived from a liver
 metastasis). If morphologically distinct, organoids can be either manually removed from the culture
 or separated based on their density or size. A check to conﬁrm the identity of the removed organoids
 (for example, a quantitative PCR for tissue-speciﬁc markers or DNA sequencing for the absence of
 mutations) is recommended after the separation.
 Although it has been shown that organoids can capture tumor heterogeneity12,84, we recommend
 drug screening of low passage cultures to minimize the effect of potential in vitro selection by used
 culture media or accumulation of in vitro mutations. It has been shown previously that organoid
 cultures established from different tumor clones of the same tumor respond differently to therapy12.
 Therefore, it is plausible that heterogeneous organoid cultures can show more variability in drug
 response when the screen is repeated in both earlier and later passages of the culture (assuming clonal
 selection might occur in vitro). Especially here, genetic characterization of the organoid culture at the
 time of screening is essential.
 In summary, we advise on the genetic characterization of both the obtained organoid line and
 primary tissue to conﬁrm that the screened cells (i) are a representative culture (via targeted
 sequencing or whole exome or genome sequencing) and (ii) can be matched with the primary tissue
 from which they originated, for example, via SNP/STR (single-nucleotide polymorphism/short tan-
 dem repeat) analysis if no exome or genome sequencing is performed. For this, DNA collected on the
 day of screening would be the best control.

 Preparation of organoids for drug screening (Steps 43–50)
 Depending on their origin, organoids can be split by TrypLE digestion or mechanical disruption
 using a plugged glass Pasteur pipette. After organoid disruption, cells are plated and cultured as usual,
 in drops of BME or Matrigel that are covered with organoid expansion medium (the exact media
 composition varies according to the tissue of origin; see Supplementary Table 1). Certain growth
 factors or other medium components might inﬂuence the response to or interact with the drug being
 tested. Appropriate modiﬁcations to the growth media composition should therefore be considered
 and, if required, made accordingly. For example, when screening organoids to assess their response to
 anti-EGFR antibodies, the concentration of EGF present in the culture media will directly affect the
 readout19,39,85.

 Dispensing of organoids for screening (Steps 51–57)
 On the day the screen is started (the timing depends on which organoids are used to perform the
 screening), dispase can be added to the culture to remove the BME or Matrigel. Organoids should be
 subsequently washed and ﬁltered to remove large organoids, as large organoids will introduce var-
 iation in the readout of the screen. After ﬁltering, organoids are counted and the organoid suspension
 is brought to the desired density in organoid culture media containing 5% (vol/vol) BME or Matrigel.

 The optimal number of organoids per well varies by tissue. Lastly, organoids are dispensed in
 384-well plates at the desired density; we use a ThermoFisher Multidrop dispenser. Because of the
 presence of ECM in the organoid suspension, it is important to keep the organoid suspension cold
 and prime the tubing from the dispenser with cold PBS to prevent clogging of the tubing.


 Treatment of organoids with the therapy of interest (Steps 58–74)
 Chemotherapeutic agents can easily be dispensed into 384-well plates using a drug printer such as an
 HP D300e digital dispenser. An example of a drug screen layout created using the D300e software is
 shown in Fig. 3b. To properly assess cell viability during the readout, it is important to include wells
 containing a compound that kills all cells as a positive control (e.g., staurosporin or cycloheximide),
 and wells containing the relevant drug solvent as a negative control (Fig. 3c). In addition to che-
 motherapy, the effect of radiotherapy can also be assessed (by delivering different dosages to different
 plates of organoids using a gamma irradiator). It is important to include technical replicates on the
 screening plate (at least triplicates) to correct for intra-plate variability. Radiotherapy can be applied
 both as a single agent or combined with chemotherapy. For single-agent application, radiotherapy
 should be applied in multiple dosages, to determine AUC values (similar in principle to testing
 different concentrations of chemotherapy to determine IC50 values). Optimization of the screening
 setup should be considered for each new therapy tested, both the number of concentrations

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 (a minimum of nine according to ref. 36) and the range (e.g., to obtain measurements with at least two
 concentrations in each plateau of the kill curve according to ref. 86) to obtain accurate IC50 estimates.
 For chemoradiotherapy assessments, we apply radiation 1 d after the addition of a chemotherapeutic
 drug so that chemotherapy can properly act as a radiosensitizer in vitro.

 Readout and analysis of drug screening (Steps 75–88)
 We perform a readout for chemotherapeutic agents 5 d after the start of treatment. Depending on the
 application, the best timing may require optimization. An example of HNSCC organoids that were
 exposed to a carboplatin gradient is shown in Fig. 3d. For readout, intracellular ATP levels, which
 serve as a surrogate for cell viability, are measured using CellTiter-Glo 3D Reagent. After addition of
 the cell-viability reagent using the Multidrop dispenser, the culture plate with the organoids is
 incubated to allow lysis of the cells. Readout is performed by measuring the luminescence signal from
 each individual well. For analysis, the signal obtained from the wells with the negative controls (i.e.,
 drug solvent) is set to 100%, whereas the signal obtained from the wells containing the positive
 controls (i.e., staurosporin or cycloheximide) is set at 0%. These control wells are used to calculate Z
 factors to indicate the quality of the data generated in the screening plate. Eventually, kill curves can
 be generated that describe the sensitivity of individual organoid lines (Fig. 3e). IC50, AUC values or
 normalized growth rate inhibition (GR) metrics can be extrapolated for quantitative analysis (Fig. 3f).
 While we describe the use of ATP-based assays as a readout for cell viability, alternative readouts such
 as live imaging71,87, live/dead ﬂuorescent markers40 and CellTiter-Blue30 may be used and incor-
 porated into the drug-screening pipeline. In this paper, we describe data analysis using GraphPad
 Prism. We chose to describe analysis using this software, to allow any researcher (also without
 extensive bioinformatics skills) to perform data analysis and obtain graphs that allow visualization of
 these results. Prism also allows calculation of IC50 and/or AUC values, which can serve as a sum-
 marizing metric of the drug sensitivity of the tested culture. However, when analyzing large datasets
 containing many variables (e.g., performing screening of combination treatments where both drugs
 are titrated over a gradient), other analysis programs should be considered, since GraphPad Prism
 cannot handle such complex datasets.

 Interpretation of the screening results
 Using in vitro drug screening, IC50, AUC or GR metrics can be obtained for each individual patient-
 derived organoid line and for each therapy tested, with the latter metric showing the most robust
 results independent of cell division rate36. Although these values indicate in vitro sensitivities, they
 cannot be directly translated to clinical therapy resistance or sensitivity. Characterizing the range of
 IC50/AUC/GR metrics that can be obtained in vitro in a panel of patient-derived organoid lines, and
 learning how these values correlate to in vivo responses will be essential for interpreting these
 numbers. For this, it is important to screen a panel of organoids that capture the heterogeneity of the
 disease of interest. This should be taken into consideration when establishing these assays for
 therapies not previously tested. When possible, correlation to clinical responses in this ‘training set’
 will aid in translating the obtained in vitro values toward a clinically relevant result.
 Both IC50 and AUC are inﬂuenced by the in vitro proliferation rate. To uncouple the effect of cell
 proliferation from the sensitivity of the cells for the therapy tested, GR metrics can be used as a
 measure for in vitro drug sensitivity36. This requires only minor changes in experimental setup
 (collection of control values at the start of the experiment). Although the analysis required for the
 calculation of GR metrics is beyond the scope of this protocol, we do indicate these required changes
 in experimental setup in our protocol as optional steps. GR metrics can be easily calculated using the
 online GR calculator at http://www.grcalculator.org/grcalculator/. The use of GR values will result in
 higher reproducibility of the drug-screening result. However, it must be noted that taking this factor
 out of the equation could decrease the correlation between patient and organoid response, if pro-
 liferation rate in culture reﬂects the proliferation rate in vivo. Therefore, while screening the pre-
 viously mentioned ‘training set’ to assess predictive potential of organoids in a speciﬁc setting, we
 propose calculating all metrics to determine which one gives the most-reproducible results (which
 could vary depending on the therapy tested).
 Apart from these considerations, other factors such as the in vivo tumor microenvironment,
 patient general health, drug metabolism, patient pre-treatment, mode of action of the drugs tested,
 in vitro assay duration or culture artifacts (such as contamination with normal epithelial cells) may
 inﬂuence either patient response or drug-screening results and should be considered when comparing
 organoid and patient responses88.

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 It has been shown that methods used to determine drug sensitivity in vitro directly affect the
 reproducibility of the obtained results34,37. A report that compared results of two independent studies
 on sensitivity of cell lines to a range of different agents concluded that results obtained by the
 different groups only marginally correlated34. However, when results were not compared by the
 obtained absolute metrics (IC50 or AUC), but rather by using discrete values (i.e., trends indicating
 sensitivity or resistance), the results were found to correlate37. This suggests that, although variation
 cannot be eliminated, biologically relevant drug sensitivities can be detected using different meth-
 odologies. Important conclusions can be drawn from these studies: (i) absolute metrics will differ
 when different methodologies are applied34 and (ii) technical variability can be minimized by
 adhering to good laboratory practice. These basic drug-screening ‘rules’ should include the use of a
 drug dosage range ﬁne-tuned to the drug and cultures tested and adhering to methodological
 requirements36, adherence to standardized operating procedures rather than experience-based
 laboratory work and using the same readout for cell viability (e.g., following standardized viability
 statistics such as GR metrics)35,36. However, it has been shown that, even when adhering to these
 guidelines, variation (both biological and technical) is likely to still be observed when performing
 drug screening. It should be noted that the source of such variation was found to be highly variable
 itself35 and, thus, perhaps even impossible to eliminate following a standardized protocol. Therefore,
 we encourage all researchers to ﬁrst assess assay reproducibility in their own facilities when testing
 either a novel organoid model or novel compound, in addition to adhering to the guidelines men-
 tioned here and described by others in more detail35,37.
