Procedure
 1 While culturing human iPSCs, prepare a sterile 24-well plate and place sterile glass coverslips (12 mm diameter) onto the bottom of each well.
 Prepare at least six wells.
 2 Add 300 µl Matrigel/DMEM/F12 solution, described in the Reagent setup, per well of the 24-well plate. Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in
 an incubator.
 3 Aspirate the Matrigel solution and add 500 µl of mTESR1 medium and 10 µM Rock inhibitor (Y-27632 2HCl) per well.
 4 Passage your iPSCs as usual and seed one drop of cell suspension with 1 ml serological pipette into each Matrigel-coated and mTeSR1 (including
 Rock inhibitor) ﬁlled well. Place the 24-well plate into the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) and do not move the plate for the next 24–48 h. Check for
 cell attachment after 2 d and then change medium daily.
 5 When iPSC colonies/patches have reached a diameter of 200–500 µm, proceed with the ﬁxation.
 6 Aspirate the medium and gently add 500 µl DMEM/F12 (prewarmed in a 37 °C warm water bath) to each well.
 7 Aspirate the DMEM/F12 and gently add 500 µl PFA (prewarmed in a 37 °C warm water bath) gently to each well without detaching the cells.
 8 Incubate the plate for 10 min at RT.
 9 Aspirate the PFA carefully and gently add 500 µl PBS-Glycine to wash out the PFA. Repeat the washing step two more times.
 CRITICAL Perform the washing steps carefully not to detach the ﬁxed adherent cells.

10 Aspirate the PBS-Glycine after the third time washing and add 500 µl of permeabilization solution. Incubate for 10 min at RT.
 11 Aspirate the permeabilzation solution and wash three times with 500 µl PBS-Glycine.
12 Aspirate the PBS-Glycine after the third time of washing and add 500 µl of blocking solution.
 PAUSE POINT Store plate at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks wrapped with Paraﬁlm to prevent evaporation and drying out of the ﬁxed cells, or

 proceed with the immunostaining after 1 h incubation at RT with blocking solution.
 13 Dilute the ﬁrst primary antibody as recommended, for example, OCT4 in blocking buffer. Recommended markers to check for pluripotency of
 human iPSCs are OCT4 (POU5F1), Nanog, SSEA4, Tra-1-60 and/or Tra-1-81.
14 Aspirate the blocking solution and add 200 µl of antibody dilution into a well. Incubate at RT for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C in a refrigerator or
 cold room.
15 Aspirate the primary antibody dilution and wash three times with 500 µl of blocking solution.
16 Aspirate the blocking solution after the third washing step and add 500 µl of secondary antibody dilution (for details, see antibody table).
 Incubate for 1 h at RT and protect from light.
 CRITICAL Keep plate in the dark from now on because secondary antibodies are light sensitive and will bleach out, resulting in signal
 c


 loss later.
17 Aspirate the secondary antibody dilution and wash three times with blocking solution.
18 Repeat steps 14–18 for the next primary and secondary antibodies. Add 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) or Hoechst 33342 dye (both Life
 technologies) at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1–0.5 µg/ml or 1–5 µg/ml, respectively, for nuclear staining to the last secondary antibody incubation.
19 Aspirate the blocking solution after the third washing step and add 500 µl distilled water to each well.
20 Remove the glass cover slip from each well carefully with tweezers and place it with the cells on top on a paper for 5 min at RT and protected
 from light.
21 Take a glass slide and add a 3 µl drop of Mowiol. Take the coverslip with tweezers without scratching the center (touch only the rim), ﬂip the
 coverslip and place it with the cell side onto the Mowiol on the glass slide. Place the coverslip slowly to prevent air bubbles. Let it dry for
 15–30 min at RT and protected from light.
22 Continue imaging with a ﬂuorescence microscope.
 PAUSE POINT Alternatively, store slides at 4 °C in refrigerator or cold room protected from light for up to 6 months until imaging.

 Finally, OVB organoids can also allow the study of complex electric circuitry development and the
 visual pathway, as they harbor light-sensitive cells (neural retina with cells expressing GAD6), cell
 types representing light signal processing nuclei (lateral geniculate nuclei expressing PCP4) and
 perhaps primitive visual cortex (cells expressing TGS2, SLC24A3, THBS2 and NNF)5.

 Drug testing and environmental effects
 Successful disease modeling with OVB organoids would enable using them as a preclinical human
 model to test the agents that can mitigate or rescue clinically relevant phenotypes without animal
 trials. These may include the application of gene delivery such as adeno-associated viral delivery of
 genes, anti-sense oligonucleotides and translational readthrough drugs. Furthermore, when generated
 from clinical patient iPSCs, the patient-speciﬁc OVB organoids could serve as a platform for per-
 sonalized therapy testing. This has an advantage of studying the effect of patient mutations and
 avoids interspecies differences if using conventional preclinical models with animals since it is from
 the patient material. Finally, OVB organoids could be used as a toolkit for analyzing environmental
 impacts on the human embryonic brain and eye development, such as neurotropic viral infections,
 pollution, chemicals, radiation and gravity.

 Tissue engineering and potential stem cell replacement therapy
 iPSCs-derived RPE cells have already been transplanted into a patient with exudative age-related
 macular degeneration and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy42. However, the quality and stability of
 cells differentiated in 2D versus 3D still need to be discovered. Moreover, in our protocol, RPE cells
