Organoids are typically\n three-dimensional (3D) cellular clusters that resemble key aspects of native tissues, including their\n cellular composition, morphology and functionality, thereby representing an intermediate between\n conventional 2D or 3D cell cultures and animal models1. Organoids have been generated for a broad\n range of tissues, including the intestine2, kidney3 and brain4, and can be used for various applications\n in basic and translational research1,5. We recently established a novel organoid model termed ‘heart-\n forming organoids’ (HFOs), which resemble early human heart, foregut and vasculature develop-\n ment, and which can, for example, be used for monitoring genetic defects in vitro6. In this protocol,\n we provide additional details of the method we used to facilitate the robust differentiation of HFOs\n from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including embryonic stem cells and induced\n PSCs (iPSCs).\n HFOs consist of a speciﬁc morphological structure, which is schematically depicted in Fig. 1: a\n dense myocardial layer (ML) composed of cardiomyocytes is lined by endocardial-like cells, which\n surround an inner core (IC). The IC comprises anterior foregut endoderm (AFE) tissue and is\n pervaded by vessel-like structures. The ML is covered by a loose outer layer (OL) consisting of\n cardiomyocytes, septum-transversum-like cells and liver progenitors (posterior foregut endoderm,\n PFE), and further enclosed by an outermost layer of mesenchymal cells6. Together, HFOs closely\n resemble patterns of early heart anlagen prior to heart tube formation, which form by an inductive\n exchange with the developing foregut endoderm in the embryo7. As the ﬁrst hPSC-derived model\n mimicking this tissue interplay, HFOs open new perspectives for investigating mechanisms of human\n embryogenesis, disease modeling and drug discovery.\n\n Development of the protocol\n In general, organoids can be derived from adult stem cells or PSCs. The basic concept of organoid\n formation relies on the stem cells’ capability to self-organize into organ-like tissue patterns upon\n proper stimulation in vitro. Cells are typically exposed to tissue-speciﬁc patterning factors inside a\n hydrogel such as Matrigel, which enables the formation of complex 3D structures1,5. For the for-\n mation of HFOs, we accordingly combined Matrigel encapsulation of hPSC aggregates with an\n established strategy for directed cardiac differentiation based on biphasic WNT pathway modulation\n\n 1\n Leibniz Research Laboratories for Biotechnology and Artiﬁcial Organs (LEBAO), Department of Cardiothoracic, Transplantation and Vascular Surgery\n (HTTG), REBIRTH—Research Center for Translational Regenerative Medicine, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hannover, Germany. 2These authors\n contributed equally: Lika Drakhlis, Santoshi Biswanath Devadas. ✉e-mail: zweigerdt.robert@mh-hannover.de\n\n 5652 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | DECEMBER 2021 | 5652–5672 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n Side view Front view\n Mesenchymal cells\n\n PFE/liver progenitors\n\n Cardiomyocytes\n\n Septum-transversum-like cells\n\n Myocardial layer\n\n AFE\n\n Vessel-like structures\n\n Endocardial-like cells\n\n Fig. 1 | Scheme of an HFO. The HFO is shown from the side and in the front view (view from the culture plate\n bottom). Figure adapted from ref. 6.\n\n using the small molecules CHIR99021 (CHIR) and IWP26,8,9. In addition to requiring Matrigel\n encapsulation and WNT pathway modulation, proper induction of the spatiotemporal patterning of\n HFOs required the exact interplay of several deﬁned cues, in particular the aggregate size, culture\n medium volume and process timing combined with a speciﬁc concentration of CHIR. In addition to\n cardiomyogenesis, CHIR treatment has been used to ‘kick-start’ the differentiation of hPSCs into\n multiple other lineages, including deﬁnitive endoderm10, hepatocytes11 and endothelial cells (ECs)12.\n Moreover, previous work has shown that changes in bulk cell density (i.e., the number of hPSCs per\n culture medium volume) in the presence of CHIR can shift the primitive streak-like priming of\n hPSCs, forming either deﬁnitive endoderm or presomitic mesoderm instead of pre-cardiac meso-\n derm. Thus, ‘simple’ WNT pathway induction results in broad developmental potential13,14.\n\n Comparison with other methods to model heart tissue formation\n A variety of studies on in vitro models of heart tissue formation have been published. However, other\n groups’ work has mainly focused on the engineering of hPSC-derived or primary cardiac cell types,\n including cardiomyocytes, ECs and ﬁbroblasts, into (adult-like) heart tissue models15–21. In contrast\n to the HFO approach, key aspects of native heart development were not mimicked by these studies.\n Models of heart development have been published by Ma et al.22 and Hoang et al.23, who generated\n ‘cardiac microchambers’ by geometric conﬁnement of hPSCs, and by Andersen et al.24, who derived\n ‘precardiac organoids’ from mouse PSCs. Although these models do mimic aspects of cardiogenesis,\n they do not reﬂect the complex spatiotemporal patterns of early heart development, which occurs in\n interplay with foregut endoderm formation. Overcoming this issue, Rossi et al.25 have recently\n described a method for inducing cardiogenesis in gastruloids derived from mouse PSCs. This type of\n organoid comprises cardiac progenitors self-organizing into a heart tube-like domain, which is\n separated from a primitive gut-like tube by an endocardial-like layer. Importantly, however, in\n contrast to any other in vitro model, our hPSC-derived HFOs show the highly organized co-\n development of heart and anterior versus PFE anlagen in combination with endocardium and\n vascular-like network formation. This structure is a result of the exact interplay of several deﬁned\n cues combined with Matrigel encapsulation and WNT pathway modulation as described above, and\n will promote novel mechanistic studies of human organogenesis in vitro.\n\n Applications of the protocol\n HFOs represent a model system of human heart, foregut and vascular network formation at early\n developmental stages. Given that HFO generation is highly robust and relatively fast and can be\n applied to different hPSC lines, HFOs represent a potent tool to investigate a broad range of basic and\n translational questions. For example, HFOs can be used to study genetic defects in vitro. We have\n demonstrated this by generating NKX2.5 knock-out HFOs, which had malformations of heart\n development similar to those observed in transgenic mice6. The co-differentiation of several cell\n lineages in HFOs, which co-develop in the embryo in a similar way, enables the simultaneous\n monitoring of effects caused by, for example, genetic mutations that differentially impact on the\n distinct lineages. We also anticipate that HFOs could serve as an advanced platform for pharma-\n cological studies, including drug screening as well as teratogenicity and toxicity assays, which should\n help to identify substances and mechanisms causing tissue- and organ-speciﬁc birth defects.\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | DECEMBER 2021 | 5652–5672 | www.nature.com/nprot 5653\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n hPSC culture HFO formation: preculture\n\n Monolayer\n hPSCs on MEFs\n frozen stock d-4 d-3 d-2\n Cell seeding (5,000 hPSCs) Aggregate Matrigel embedding\n in 96-U-well plate formation\n\n\n >2\n hPSCs on passages ~1 h\n monolayer\n\n >4\n passages\n\n E8 E8; 100 μL culture volume\n\n\n HFO formation: differentiation Analysis\n\n d0 d10 Staining/histology/microscopy\n\n\n d1 d3 d5 d7\n\n\n Flow cytometry scRNAseq\n 800\n\n\n t-SNE 2\n Imaging in the 600\n front view 400\n CHIR99021 IWP2\n 7.5 μM; 24 h 5 μM; 48 h 200\n RB–; 200 μL culture volume RB+; 200 μL culture volume\n t-SNE 1\n 0 300 600 900 1,2 k\n\nFig. 2 | Schematic illustration of the HFO differentiation from hPSCs. HFO formation is initiated on differentiation day minus 4 (d-4) from hPSCs\ngrown in 2D monolayers coming from MEF cultures (Steps 1A–9) or from a monolayer frozen stock (Steps 1B–9). On d-4, 5,000 cells are seeded per\nwell of an ultra-low attachment 96-U-well plate, followed by centrifugation to form one hPSC aggregate per well (Steps 10–13). On d-2, aggregates are\nindividually embedded in Matrigel droplets (Steps 14–21) followed by differentiation using the small molecules CHIR99021 and IWP2 (Steps 22–27).\nHFO differentiation is completed on d10 (Step 28). Before proceeding with further experiments, HFOs should be assessed under an inverted\nmicroscope (to observe the HFOs from the culture plate bottom) to ensure proper patterning. Analysis of HFOs can be performed by various methods,\nincluding staining and imaging, scRNAseq or ﬂow cytometry (Steps 31–46). t-SNE, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.\n\n\n Limitations\n As noted above, HFOs recapitulate well-established patterns of early embryogenesis. However, there\n are distinct differences compared with native heart and foregut development. In contrast to the\n embryo, HFOs do not comprise a continuous, single foregut tube but display two spatially distinct\n anterior versus posterior foregut endoderm compartments. The heart anlage in HFOs is thus located\n between these foregut-like tissues rather than ventrally to the foregut tube as in the embryo. A further\n limitation of the model is the incomplete patterning of the heart anlage, which results in detection of\n second heart ﬁeld-like cells in HFOs only, with an absence of ﬁrst heart ﬁeld-like cell patterns6.\n Moreover, it has to be considered that the modeling capabilities of HFOs are so far limited to very\n early developmental stages only. Later events such as heart tube formation, looping and cardiac\n chamber development are not recapitulated by the current model. Also, the two foregut endoderm\n compartments comprise immature tissue. Further protocol development to further maturation will\n thus be required to advance the model since HFOs seem to degenerate upon long-term cultivation\n under the current culture conditions6.\n\n\n Experimental design\n Prior to commencing the protocol, hPSCs must be derived by established monolayer culture8,26.\n HFOs are generated by seeding 5,000 hPSCs per well of an ultra-low attachment 96-U-well plate on\n ‘differentiation day minus 4’ (d-4) followed by centrifugation to form one aggregate per well. After 2 d\n of cultivation (on d-2), these aggregates are individually embedded in Matrigel droplets. Another 2 d\n later (on d0), induction of directed differentiation is initiated by CHIR supplementation until d1\n followed by IWP2 treatment (d3–d5); on d10, HFO differentiation is completed. The HFO differ-\n entiation protocol is schematically outlined in Fig. 2 and explained in detail below. Although no\n special skills or equipment are needed to implement the protocol, it requires practice and attention to\n\n5654 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | DECEMBER 2021 | 5652–5672 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n details. All steps have to be followed precisely to ensure a successful outcome. We therefore\n recommend a couple of practice runs prior to applying the protocol for investigating speciﬁc ques-\n tions. Based on our experience, we anticipate that a person with ~6–12 months of cell culture\n experience should be able to perform the protocol, including successful HFO formation and sub-\n sequent analysis.\n For protocol adaptations such as the use of other cell lines (such as novel reporter, knock-out or\n patient-speciﬁc iPSC lines) or speciﬁc compound treatment (such as growth factors, pharmacological\n compounds, etc.) during differentiation, we recommend the following:\n ● Any new cell line needs to be tested. Although HFOs have been successfully derived from human\n\n\n embryonic stem cell and iPSC lines using this protocol without modiﬁcations, it is possible that some\n cell lines may require adaptations concerning, for example, the initial cell number seeded for aggregate\n formation or modulation of the CHIR concentration used to initiate differentiation\n ● Although the protocol is robust, we recommend the induction of more HFOs than actually needed for\n\n\n the experiment. This will ensure that enough successfully formed HFO samples and relevant repeats\n will be available to enable the reliable experimental analysis and interpretation. This will also account\n for potential variation or even loss of HFOs due to experimental failure such as mechanical damaging\n of HFOs during the pipetting steps. Only successfully formed, properly patterned HFOs should be used\n for subsequent analyses\n ● It is important that appropriate controls are included within each experiment, such as untreated HFOs\n\n\n or HFOs derived from the respective nontargeted wild-type cell line, if applicable. Moreover, before\n drawing conclusions about the potential impact of an experimental treatment on HFO pattern\n formation, robust intra- and interexperimental repeats are required to substantiate novel results\n ●\n HFOs must be fully characterized. Analysis of HFOs can be performed by different methods such as\n whole-mount immunoﬂuorescence (IF) staining and microscopy, histology, gene expression studies\n and ﬂow cytometry of dissociated HFOs, for which we provide a detailed protocol below. However, it\n should be noted that every new analytical method will require establishment and thorough validation\n to comply with the speciﬁc requirements of the different tissues in HFOs, which show differential\n cell–cell adhesion properties, tissue density, etc. Thus, every method has to be critically validated\n regarding its suitability for every cell/tissue type in HFOs and with respect to the respective stage of\n HFO differentiation\n\nMaterials\n Biological materials\n ● hPSC lines: we have successfully used the following hPSC lines for HFO differentiation: the HES3\n NKX2.5-eGFP reporter cell line27,28 (sex chromosomes: XX; RRID: CVCL_A8JT), which we obtained\n from S.C.

CAUTION Cell lines should be regularly\n checked for pluripotency, karyotype integrity and lack of mycoplasma infection by applying respective\n standard methods. ! CAUTION Note that, in general, sex differences of cell lines can make a difference\n to the experimental outcome, and it is therefore important to use cells from both sexes. Notably, HFOs\n have been successfully differentiated using cell lines from both sexes.\n\n Reagents\n Culture media and supplements\n ●\n B27 supplement plus insulin (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, cat. no. 17504-044)\n ● B27 supplement minus insulin (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, cat. no.

Move the ﬂask a few times back\n and forth and left to right at the point where it is placed in the incubator to ensure that the cells are\n equally distributed (Supplementary Video 1).\n CRITICAL STEP The optimal seeding density has to be identiﬁed for every hPSC line as\n c\n\n\n previously described8,26. An appropriate seeding density is one that results in a conﬂuent\n monolayer of cells after 3–4 d of culture.\n 8 Change the medium after 2 d and then daily by aspirating the medium and adding 5 mL of fresh E8\n (Y27632 is only required for cell seeding and so is not needed).\n 9 After 3–4 d, the hPSCs will have formed a conﬂuent monolayer; passage again by repeating\n Steps 2–8.\n CRITICAL STEP For hPSCs precultured on MEFs (Step 1, option A), the cells have to be passaged\n c\n\n\n at least four times in monolayer culture on Geltrex to ensure complete depletion of MEFs before\n initiation of the HFO differentiation protocol.\n CRITICAL STEP For hPSCs inoculated from a monolayer-derived frozen stock (Step 1, option B),\n c\n\n\n we recommend at least two passages in monolayer culture before initiation of the HFO\n differentiation protocol.\n CRITICAL STEP We recommend maintaining hPSCs on MEFs and regularly starting a new\n c\n\n\n monolayer culture from there. Do not exceed eight passages in monolayer culture. We also\n recommend assessing the pluripotency of the cells regularly as previously described8.\n\n\n Generation of HFOs from hPSCs\n d-4: cell seeding and aggregate formation ● Timing 45 min\n CRITICAL HFO formation starts with a preculture period designated as day minus 4 (d-4) until\n c\n\n\n d-1; this comprises hPSC seeding, aggregate formation and Matrigel embedding, followed by the actual\n differentiation controlled by CHIR and IWP2 supplementation from d0 to d10 (Fig. 2). The timing\n listed for this and the following sections is for parallel formation of 36 HFOs (in three rows of a\n 96-U-well plate).\n 10 Detach hPSCs (from Step 9; at an appropriate passage) at 80–90% conﬂuence from a T25 by\n Accutase treatment, and count the cells as described in Steps 2–5.\n 11 Prepare a stock cell suspension at a concentration of 5,000 cells per 100 µL medium by adding an\n appropriate amount of cells from Step 10 (based on the desired number of HFOs) to E8 + 10 μM\n Y27632. Gently resuspend the cells.\n CRITICAL STEP If aiming for a certain amount of HFOs, we recommend to seed 12 wells more\n c\n\n\n than would actually be required for the respective experiment to take into account potential loss of\n aggregates during the differentiation or failed differentiation of some HFOs. For example\n calculations, see Table 1.\n CRITICAL STEP An excess of 10–20% of the stock cell suspension is also recommended, which\n c\n\n\n facilitates proper pipetting and resuspension of the cells. For example calculations, see Table 1.\n\n5660 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | DECEMBER 2021 | 5652–5672 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n a c\n\n\n d-4 Not round\n\n\n b\n d-2 Not round Not one aggregate Dust Too small\n\n\nFig. 4 | Preculture of HFOs. a, Morphology of an hPSC pellet (good, green tick, versus bad, red cross) at the bottom of the 96-U-well plate after\ncentrifugation on d-4. b, Morphology of properly formed versus failed hPSC aggregates on d-2 before embedding in Matrigel. c, Schematic of the\nembedding of an hPSC aggregate in a Matrigel droplet (Steps 14–21).

Perform the cell counting with the\n hemocytometer carefully, and ensure proper preparation of the stock cell suspension. Ensure gentle\n but thorough resuspension of the cells in the culture medium to distribute the cells evenly.\n 12 Seed 100 µL of the stock cell suspension per well of a U-shaped ultra-low attachment 96-well plate.\n Seed 12 wells (one row) more than the number of desired HFOs (Table 1).\n CRITICAL STEP After each row, pipet the remaining stock suspension up and down to\n c\n\n\n ensure homogeneous resuspension of the cells and thus the correct cell number in each well\n seeded afterward.\n 13 Centrifuge the plate at 300g and 4 °C for 3 min to bring the cells to the culture plate bottom, and\n place the plate into the incubator.\n CRITICAL STEP Ensure that, after centrifugation, the hPSCs form a round cell pellet at the\n c\n\n\n culture plate bottom as shown in Fig. 4a. Place the plate into the incubator very carefully, and do\n not move it for at least 24 h to ensure that one round aggregate will form per well overnight.\n ? TROUBLESHOOTING\n\n d-2: Matrigel embedding of hPSC aggregates ● Timing 2 h\n CRITICAL Two days after seeding (d-2), the hPSC aggregates are embedded in Matrigel droplets.\n c\n\n\n 14 Before you start, take out the required amount of Matrigel aliquots from the freezer and let them\n thaw on ice. When the Matrigel is thawed, insert the aliquots into the ice. Take out the sterile\n scissors (heated to at least 180 °C for at least 3 h), and let them cool down at room temperature.\n CRITICAL STEP Ensure the Matrigel is not growth-factor-reduced (use cat. no. 354234) and has\n c\n\n\n an appropriate protein concentration; HFO formation has been validated with a Matrigel\n concentration range of 9.7–10.7 mg/mL. Do not use Geltrex instead of Matrigel since this will result\n in a failed differentiation based on our experience6.\n 15 In the meantime, take a look at the 96-U-well plate under the microscope to check if the hPSC\n aggregates have properly formed. Mark the properly formed aggregates (these will be further\n embedded in Matrigel) and cross out the rest (not round or too small aggregates; see Fig. 4b for\n examples; these aggregates can be discarded later).\n CRITICAL STEP Embedding only properly formed aggregates (round, homogeneous,\n c\n\n\n ~550–650 µm in diameter) is important.\n ?

Take a 10–100 µL pipet (or\n equivalent) and set it to 20 µL (this pipet will be used for making the Matrigel droplets). The\n aggregates will be embedded in the Matrigel droplets one by one.\n CRITICAL STEP The timing of HFO differentiation (starting time points) on the different days is\n c\n\n\n critical. Begin with Step 16 4–5 h later than the time point at which Step 10 has been started on d-4.\n See Table 2 for details.\n CRITICAL STEP Form one Matrigel droplet and embed one aggregate at a time to prevent\n c\n\n\n premature solidiﬁcation of the Matrigel.\n 17 Pipet 20 µL of Matrigel into an empty well of the 96-U-well plate.\n CRITICAL STEP Depress the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop and discard the residual\n c\n\n\n volume to ensure that no air bubbles will be introduced into the Matrigel droplet. Bubbles within\n the droplets or the culture medium will cause the Matrigel droplets with the embedded aggregates\n to ﬂoat during the differentiation process, which will result in a failed differentiation. Make sure the\n Matrigel is pipetted very slowly.\n 18 Pick a properly formed aggregate. To do this, use the cut tip (from Step 16), hold the plate almost\n perpendicularly and aspirate the aggregate. It might be easier to see the aggregates if a background\n is created, for example by placing a pipet tip box behind the plate.\n ? TROUBLESHOOTING\n 19 Insert the aggregate into the Matrigel droplet by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst\n stop to prevent the formation of bubbles. Place the lid onto the plate, and check visually if the aggregate\n is inside the droplet by carefully tilting the plate and looking at the Matrigel droplet from the plate\n bottom. Steps 16–19 are shown in Supplementary Video 2 and are schematically depicted in Fig. 4c.\n CRITICAL STEP It is important not to transfer too much culture medium with the aggregate into\n c\n\n\n the droplet (not more than 6 µL) to prevent dilution of the Matrigel. Thus, if embedding of an\n aggregate in one speciﬁc Matrigel droplet fails twice, do not continue with this droplet but rather\n make a new one.\n 20 Repeat Steps 17–19 until all aggregates are embedded. Use a new tip for every Matrigel droplet. The\n cut tip does not necessarily have to be changed. Afterward, place the plate into the incubator for\n 50–60 min to let the Matrigel solidify.\n 21 Add 100 µL E8 per well. A multichannel pipet can be used in this step. Add the medium slowly and\n carefully, depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop to prevent damage and ﬂoating\n of the Matrigel droplets. Place the plate back into the incubator.\n\n d0, d1, d3, d5, d7: differentiation with CHIR and IWP2 ● Timing 30 min each\n CRITICAL Two days after embedding aggregates (d0), differentiation of the hPSC aggregates is initiated.\n c\n\n\n 22 Remove the culture medium from the wells without aspirating or damaging the Matrigel droplets\n with the aggregates. We have used two methods and recommend users try out both methods to\n identify the most suitable.\n CRITICAL STEP Begin this step at approximately the same time of day that you started Step 16 on\n c\n\n\n d-2 (Table 2).

Work carefully and slowly. It might be easier to see the\n Matrigel droplets with the aggregates if a background is created, for example by placing a\n pipet tip box behind the plate.\n (ii) To remove the rest of the medium around and below the Matrigel droplet, use a 20–200 µL\n pipet (or equivalent). Gently press the Matrigel droplet down to the wall of the well with\n the pipet tip.\n (iii) While aspirating the medium, move the pipet tip in a half-circle close to the well wall as\n schematically depicted in Fig. 5a and shown in Supplementary Video 3. Repeat this step, if\n the entire medium has not been removed from the well.\n (B) Removing the culture medium with stacked tips\n (i) Use a 20–200 µL pipet (or equivalent), and stack a 10 µL tip (autoclaved at 120 °C for\n 20 min) on a 200 µL tip as shown in Fig. 5b.\n (ii) Carefully aspirate the medium as described in Step 22, option A.

However, cell-line-dependent variations may occur without\n indication of differentiation failure.\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | DECEMBER 2021 | 5652–5672 | www.nature.com/nprot 5663\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n Table 3 | Expected diameter of an HFO during the differentiation\n\n Differentiation day Diameter in µm\n\n d-2 550–650\n d0 750–950\n d1 900–1,100\n d3 1,100–1,400\n d5 1,200–1,500\n d7 1,300–1,600\n d10 1,500–2,000\n\n\n CRITICAL STEP Since CHIR is light-sensitive, on d0, observe the aggregates under a microscope\n c\n\n\n before the medium change to prevent damage of the CHIR.\n 24 24 h later (d1, Fig. 5c), remove the culture medium carefully as described in Step 22 and add 200 µL\n RB− per well by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop. The medium can be\n added using a multichannel pipet. Then, place the plate back into the incubator and start\n monitoring the morphology of the Matrigel droplets from this day onward.\n CRITICAL STEP Removing the culture medium containing CHIR precisely after 24 h is very\n c\n\n\n important. Although a delay of a maximum of 30 min did not have an adverse effect in our cell lines\n (Table 2), other cell lines might react more sensitively to a prolonged CHIR incubation time.\n CRITICAL STEP Ensure the entire culture medium containing CHIR is removed from the wells.\n c\n\n\n Repeat Step 22 if necessary.\n CRITICAL STEP Damaging the Matrigel droplets during the medium changes (Fig. 5d) might\n c\n\n\n cause the aggregates to drop out of the droplets (Fig. 5e), which will result in failed differentiation.\n To prevent this, ensure careful and slow pipetting during the medium changes.\n ? TROUBLESHOOTING\n 25 Two days later (d3, Fig. 5c), prepare RB− supplemented with 5 µM IWP2. Remove the culture\n medium carefully from the plate as described in Step 22, and add 200 µL RB−/IWP2 per well by\n depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop.

A multichannel pipet\n can be used to add the medium. Place the plate back into the incubator afterward.\n CRITICAL STEP The culture medium containing IWP2 has to be removed after 48 h. Ideally, stay\n c\n\n\n on time; however, we found a delay of maximum 1 h did not have an adverse effect (Table 2).\n 27 Two days later (d7, Fig. 5c), remove the culture medium (by repeating Step 22) and add 200 µL RB\n + per well by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop.

Since\n the OL contains mainly loose tissue, it may partially fuse into dense structures (for example, note\n the tail-like extension in the OL of the iPSC-CB1RB9_WAS-GFP HFO; Fig. 6c). Rotated HFOs and\n HFOs with dense structures in the OL are still considered successfully formed as long as the three\n layers are visible.\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | DECEMBER 2021 | 5652–5672 | www.nature.com/nprot 5665\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n CRITICAL STEP Label the images and HFOs on the lid of the culture plate properly to make sure\n\n\n c\n that you know which HFO will be used for which analysis and that you can track back in the end\n which HFO has been used for what.\n ? TROUBLESHOOTING\n 29 If required, maintain the HFOs in culture in the 96-U-well plate in RB+. HFOs can be cultured for\n a maximum of another 2 weeks. Change the medium every 2–3 d by removing the old medium as\n described in Step 22 and adding 200 µL RB+ per well.\n 30 If subsequent analysis requires removal of the HFOs from the 96-U-well plate, use a 100–1,000 µL\n pipet and cut off a piece of the pipet tip with sterile scissors holding them at a ~90° angle relative to\n the tip. Hold the plate at a 45° angle, and insert the pipet tip perpendicularly into the well. Ensure\n tight attachment of the edge of the tip to the well bottom while aspirating the HFO. The transfer of\n an HFO from the 96-U-well plate to a 12-well suspension plate is shown in Supplementary Video 5\n and schematically depicted in Fig. 6d.\n\n Dissociation of HFOs for replating or further analysis\n 31 To dissociate and stain HFOs for subsequent ﬂow cytometry analysis, follow option A. A variation\n of the dissociation process is required to dissociate HFOs for subsequent single-cell RNA\n sequencing (scRNAseq) or replating of dissociated cells (for example, for subsequent patch clamp\n analysis), as described in option B.\n (A) Dissociation and staining of HFOs in a 96-well format for subsequent ﬂow cytometry\n analysis ● Timing 2 h\n (i) Set the thermomixer to 37 °C, and ensure that it is prewarmed before you start the\n dissociation of the HFOs.\n (ii) Transfer the HFOs from the 96-U-well plate to a V-shaped 96-well plate as described in\n Step 30 (one HFO per well).\n (iii) Carefully remove the rest of the culture medium as described in Step 22 (removing the\n medium from a V-shaped well requires the same procedure that is used for a\n U-shaped well).\n (iv) Wash the HFOs with 200 µL of PBS w/o per well (to wash, add PBS w/o and remove\n it again).\n (v) Thaw an aliquot of STEMdiff Cardiomyocyte Dissociation Medium at 37 °C in a water\n bath.

Avoid skin\n contact, ingestion and inhalation.\n CRITICAL STEP The incubation time with the STEMdiff Cardiomyocyte Dissociation\n c\n\n\n Medium is critical. Prolonged incubation might be harmful for the cells. Work as fast as\n possible in steps (v–ix).\n (vi) Place the plate on the prewarmed thermomixer, and stick adhesive tape on the four sides of\n the plate for ﬁxing the plate to the thermomixer. Set the thermomixer to 12 min\n and 1,000 rpm.\n (vii) At 12 min, remove the plate from the thermomixer and ensure homogeneous dissociation\n by resuspending the cells with a multichannel pipet for a maximum of 1 min.\n CRITICAL STEP Depending on the age of the HFOs, the incubation time with the\n c\n\n\n STEMdiff Cardiomyocyte Dissociation Medium may differ. 12–15 min is sufﬁcient for\n d10–d22 HFOs. If the HFOs are not dissociated after 12 min, place the plate back on the\n thermomixer for a maximum of 3 more min.\n ?

After some\n experience and accurate execution of the protocol, with established hPSC lines, ~90% of properly\n patterned HFOs should be obtained in each experiment6 (Fig. 7a). Proper patterning can be deter-\n mined by using the HES3 NKX2.5-eGFP reporter line and is identiﬁed by the formation of three\n layers in HFOs: the IC (comprising NKX2.5-eGFP-negative cells), the ML (NKX2.5-eGFP-positive\n cells) and the OL (NKX2.5-eGFP-positive and -negative cells) as shown in Fig. 6a,b. Notably, these\n layers can also be distinctly identiﬁed without the eGFP reporter contrast using conventional bright-\n ﬁeld microscopy (Fig. 6c). This assessment demonstrated that HFOs can be successfully generated for\n the established iPSC lines hHSC_Iso4_ADCF_SeV-iPS26,30 and iPSC-CB1RB9_WAS-GFP31 (Fig. 6c)\n as well as with several HES3-based (reporter) cell lines6. Figure 7a shows the HFO differentiation\n efﬁciencies for the abovementioned cell lines as well as for the HES3 MIXL1-GFP reporter line6,29,\n revealing similar efﬁciencies as for the HES3 NKX2.5-eGFP cell line.\n As noted above, only successfully formed HFOs showing the three morphologically distinct layers\n in the front view should be used for any subsequent analyses; only properly patterned HFOs com-\n prising heart and foregut anlagen as well as the vascular-like network will be informative for any\n envisioned assay. A cellular composition of ~40% cardiomyocytes (located in the ML and OL),\n ~4–5% ECs (distributed throughout the HFO but mainly found in the IC), ~20% AFE (located in the\n IC) and 10–15% liver progenitors/PFE (found in the OL, Fig. 1) is usually obtained. This can be\n identiﬁed by complementary scRNAseq and ﬂow cytometry assessment for relative cell type quan-\n tiﬁcation and morphologically observed by IF staining of numerous d13 HFOs6. The different tissues\n of HFOs can be analyzed by IF by staining with antibodies for cell-type-speciﬁc markers. Those\n include myosin heavy chain (MHC) or cardiac troponin T (cTnT) for cardiomyocytes (Fig. 7b,f,g),\n vimentin for mesenchymal cells (Fig. 7b), CD31 for endothelial and endocardial cells (Fig. 7c,d),\n SOX17 for endoderm (Fig. 7e), SOX2 for AFE (Fig. 7f) and HNF4α for liver progenitors/PFE (Fig.\n 7g). Notably, the two endodermal compartments can be easily identiﬁed by their morphology\n (aggregate-like appearance of the PFE and cavity-forming AFE) without the requirement for tissue-\n speciﬁc IF staining (Fig. 7b–g).\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | DECEMBER 2021 | 5652–5672 | www.nature.com/nprot 5669\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n Living cells Single cells\n 800 1.0 K\n 71.2 89.6\n\n 800\n 600\n\n 600\n\n 400\n 400\n\n 200\n 200\n SSC-A\n\n\n FSC-H\n 0\n 0 300 600 900 1.2 K 0 300 600 900 1.2 K\n FSC-A FSC-A\n\n\n 103\n 38.1 0.28 5.16 33.0 36.2 0.26\n 2 2\n 10 10\n\n 102\n\n 101 101\n\n 101\n\n 100 100\n NKX2.5-eGFP\n\n\n NKX2.5-eGFP\n\n\n cTnT-VioBlue\n 100\n\n 10–1 10–1\n 57.2 4.45 59.2 2.67 58.9 4.59\n 10–1\n –1 0 1 2 3 –2 –1 0 1\n 10 –2\n 10 –1 0\n 10 10 1\n 10 2\n 10 3\n 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 102 103\n CD31-APC cTnT-VioBlue CD31-APC\n\nFig. 8 | Gating strategy for a ﬂow cytometry analysis of an HFO.

SSC-A, side scatter area; FSC-\nA, forward scatter area; FSC-H, forward scatter height.\n\n The tissues of HFOs have different physiological and physical properties, requiring distinct\n methodological approaches for proper analysis. Therefore, all methods applied for HFO analysis such\n as tissue dissociation, ﬁxation, staining, imaging or RNA extraction may require adaptations of the\n respective standard protocols to ensure meaningful results (see ref. 6).\n In this protocol, we provide a procedure for the dissociation and staining of individual HFOs in a\n 96-well format followed by ﬂow cytometry, which is an excellent way to quantitatively analyze the\n tissue composition of HFOs (Steps 31–46). Figure 8 shows the gating strategy for a ﬂow cytometry\n analysis of a d13 HES3 NKX2.5-eGFP-derived HFO simultaneously stained with antibodies against\n cTnT and CD31 to mark cardiomyocytes and ECs, respectively. Following the gating of living cells\n and doublet exclusion, the analyzed HFO shows ~38% NKX2.5-eGFP-positive cells (the eGFP signal\n is preserved upon ﬁxation and staining using the Fix & Perm kit), ~36% cTnT-positive cardio-\n myocytes and ~4.5% CD31-positive ECs, consistent with our previously published results6.",
