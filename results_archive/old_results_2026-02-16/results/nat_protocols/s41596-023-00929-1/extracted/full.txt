Introduction

Initially perceived as passive conduits to deliver oxygen and nutrients, blood vessel cells are
now recognized as major contributors to brain health and disease1,2. During brain development,
genetic and environmental factors that impact brain vascular cells can evolve into long-term
neurological deficits3,4. In the adult brain, dysfunction in brain vascular cells contributes to
arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), stroke, neurodegeneration and glioblastoma5–9. These
diseases highlight the critical role of vascular cells for building and maintaining a healthy brain.
Further investigations into the role of vasculature in many brain pathologies offer an untapped
opportunity to ameliorate neurological disease.
 The primary building blocks of the vasculature are endothelial and mural cells. In the
brain, endothelial cells form the vascular lumen and exhibit special features, including tight
junctions and highly selective transcytosis, which together establish the blood–brain barrier
(BBB) to insulate the brain from potentially toxic substances in the blood10. Situated between the
endothelial cell lumen and the surrounding astrocytes, microglia and neurons, mural cells serve
as a critical signaling hub of the neurovascular unit. Mural cells, which include smooth muscle
cells, pericytes and fibroblasts, are critical components for the development of the BBB11,12.
Mural cell-secreted vitronectin is one known molecular signal that regulates barrier formation13.
Other pathways that regulate endothelial and mural cell communication in the prenatal human
brain include collagen, laminin, midkine, notch, fibronectin and vascular endothelial growth
factor14. Mural cells also control neurovascular coupling15–17 and contribute to inflammation and
immune cell influx into the brain18,19. In addition, both endothelial and mural cells have ‘angiocrine’
functions, secreting factors that promote neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation2,14.
Despite the critical importance of the vasculature for brain function and dysfunction, our
understanding of these cells is limited. This is due in part to the fact that vascular cells represent
only 5−10% of the total cell population in the brain14, and therefore enrichment is required to study
these cells in depth. Despite the critical roles of vascular cells, there is a dire need for efficient and
integrated approaches to isolate, culture and profile these cells in a reproducible fashion.

Development of the protocol
Overview
Here, we describe an integrated strategy designed to isolate, enrich and profile vascular cells
from prenatal human brain using single-cell transcriptomics and transplantation into cortical
organoids. The first stage of this protocol involves purifying endothelial, mural and perivascular
immune cells with FACS. These vascular cells can then be cultured in isolation in two- and
three-dimensional (2D and 3D) conditions to characterize their functional properties, including
bioenergetics. In parallel, these cells could be used in single-cell transcriptomics and multiomics
technology to investigate their molecular and cellular diversity. Finally, transplantation of these
primary vascular cells into cortical organoids (‘vascularizing organoids’) provides an effective
model to study the intricate interactions between angiogenesis and neurogenesis (Fig. 1).

Cell type isolation
To isolate vascular cells from prenatal human brain tissues, we adapted our previously
published protocol that was designed for the adult mouse brain20,21. First, prenatal human brain
tissue from the second trimester was minced with a scalpel and digested with collagenase/
dispase, triturated with DNase and centrifuged through 22% Percoll to remove debris (Fig. 2).
By mining the single-cell transcriptomics data from prenatal human brain22, we identified
CD31 (PECAM1), ANPEP (CD13) and CD45 (PTPRC) as an effective combination to isolate
endothelial and mural cells from the prenatal human brain, and simultaneously exclude
perivascular myeloid cells (Figs. 1 and 2). Flow cytometry confirmed the validity of these
markers to isolate distinct populations of endothelial cells (CD45−;CD31+;ANPEP−), mural
cells (CD45−;CD31−;ANPEP+) and perivascular immune cells (CD45+;CD31−;ANPEP−) (Fig. 3a).
As further confirmation, we found the cell surface marker CD146, an alternative mural cell
marker23, also colabeled with ANPEP (Fig. 3a). This protocol is also successful with purification

of fresh, adult human brain endothelial cells, but not mural cells. Probably this result is due to
changes in the expression of cell surface markers. CD31+ endothelial cells could be identified
and purified, but ANPEP expression was absent and CD146 expression was very low (Fig. 3b),
in agreement with other published data on adult human brain endothelial and mural cells6,9.
As far as we can determine, all of the prenatal endothelial and mural cells are captured using
CD31 and ANPEP, respectively. This conclusion is supported by the presence of all known
subtypes, including fibroblasts, in the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)14. In addition,
we also performed scRNA-seq of two additional populations, the perivascular immune cells
(CD45+;CD31−;ANPEP−) and CD45−;CD31−;ANPEP−;CD146+ cells (predominantly radial glia22).
These populations do not express vascular markers, including PECAM-1/CD31, CD34, TIE1 and
RGS5 (Fig. 3c). PDGFRB is highly expressed in mural cells, but also produced by radial glia in the
human brain24.

Cells in culture
Next, we developed in vitro cultures to characterize the morphological and functional
properties of the endothelial and mural cells (Fig. 4). Traditionally, primary endothelial cells are
difficult to passage as they quickly become quiescent in culture25. The commercially available
human umbilical vein endothelial cells may be used for this purpose. However, we and others
have found substantial lot-to-lot variability in these cells26,27. We therefore developed our own
prenatal human brain endothelial and mural cells as a cell source for experiments in culture.
Interestingly, prenatal human brain endothelial and mural cells isolated with FACS can then
be cultured and passaged in endothelial growth medium (EGM-2) (Fig. 4a). We have not used
other media extensively, but there are other choices for vascular cells, including smooth muscle
cell medium (PromoCell) and pericyte medium (ScienCell). More than 90% of mural cells
in 2D cultures express PDGFR-β+ (Fig. 4b). Similarly, >80% of endothelial cells express CD31
(Fig. 4c). In addition, these vascular cells can be used in the 3D Matrigel tube formation assay,
Seahorse assays and other applications14.

Organoid transplantation
Our recent study shows that nascent vasculatures are more enriched in the ventricular zone
and subventricular zone in the pallium and germinal matrix, suggesting the presence of
mutual interactions between angiogenesis and neurogenesis in these neurogenic niches in the
prenatal human brain14,28. Since induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical organoids
recapitulate early stages of human cerebral cortex development, the organoids offer a logical
model to provide more mechanistic insights into these interactions. Notably, one inherent
challenge in iPSC-derived cortical organoids is the lack of vasculature that provides sufficient
nutrients to support neural development. While there is increasing effort to complement
organoid models with vascular cells29–31, no previous studies have added brain-specific vascular
cells to the cortical organoids. To test the developmental potentials of vascular cells and their
interactions with neural progenitors, we transplanted FACS-purified endothelial and mural
cells into 7–9-week-old iPSC-derived cortical organoids, which mimic cortical development
during the second trimester32 (Figs. 1 and 5). Since the primary human brain vascular cells
are also from the second trimester, this approach to vascularize cortical organoids offers
an unique advantage to interrogate neurovascular interactions in prenatal human brain.

Nature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 606

Protocol extension


 Before transplantation, endothelial and mural cells were labeled by adeno-associated virus
 (AAV)–cytomegalovirus (CMV)–GFP, which allowed us to track the transplanted cells as they
 migrated and integrated into the organoids (Fig. 5a). Following transplantation, we maintained
 organoids for 2 weeks, and then fixed and analyzed them with immunohistochemistry and
 RNAscope14 (also Fig. 5b,c).

 Transcriptomics
 Finally, prenatal human brain endothelial and mural cells can be used in transcriptomics
 studies14. Critically, the isolation of fresh cells with FACS allows whole-cell transcriptomics,
 which can facilitate a wider possibility of bioinformatic data analysis, such as RNA velocity.

 Applications of the method
 This protocol is applicable to a wide variety of questions in neuroscience and developmental
 and vascular biology. With the increasing popularity of neuroimmunology, the microglia
 obtained through this procedure can also be employed to study vasculature–microglia
 interactions during brain development33. In addition, delivering therapeutics across the BBB
 has been a longstanding challenge for bioengineers, biologists and chemists34–36. Our protocol

offers direct investigations into the molecular and cellular properties of a diverse population of
vascular cells that will allow us to resolve the challenges to cross the BBB.
 Each of three core components in this protocol—FACS, in vitro cultures and transcriptomics—
can be used in multiple applications and iterations. First, the unique protocol for tissue
dissociation and FACS-based validations can be used to analyze the cellular composition of
vascular and perivascular immune cells in samples of interest from different developmental
ages and different pathologies. Our protocol uses only 5 fluorophores, which can be expanded
to up to 16 with conventional flow cytometry or dozens more with high-parameter flow.
With renewed interest in understanding different subtypes of vascular and perivascular
cells, inclusion of more FACS channels in this protocol will offer flexibility to select different
subpopulations. Second, this protocol provides a comprehensive approach using in vitro
cultures, including the vascular cells in isolation or their interactions with neural cells in cortical
organoids14. For instance, these cells can be grown and passaged in 2D culture for proliferation
assays or in Matrigel to examine their potential for vascular tube formation14. In these assays,
anti-angiogenic or angiogenic factors can be added or inhibited to interrogate their role on
vascular proliferation and tube formation. The vascularization of organoids is increasingly
popular29–31,37; our detailed protocol will allow widespread application of primary cells for this
purpose, which we demonstrated have important implications14. Our protocol will open new
directions for future research to improve the environmental milieu for cortical organoids
and to further elucidate mechanisms that govern the interaction between angiogenesis and
neurogenesis in prenatal human brain. Finally, our protocol can isolate diverse populations of
primary brain vascular cells, which provide critical resources for scRNA-seq to characterize the
molecular mechanisms for angiogenesis in prenatal human brain14. In addition to scRNA-seq,
these cells could alternatively be utilized with multiomics, in bulk or single cell, for proteomics
and epigenomics. This protocol can be easily adapted to profile vascular cells in brain tissues
from different brain regions, different ages and different pathologies.

Comparison with other methods
For vascular cell dissociation, the key advantages to this protocol are its simplicity and efficacy
to isolate a diverse population of vascular cells from human brain. In our experience and that

of others, vascular cell dissociation requires careful selection of enzymes, as mechanical
dissociation is especially detrimental to endothelial cells38. With relatively few steps and
inexpensive reagents, robust yields of healthy vascular and perivascular cells can be obtained
in 6 h. This protocol evolved from our previous strategy to purify vascular cells from the adult
mouse brain, focused on the cortex and ventricular/subventricular zone20,21. Surprisingly,
we found that similar endothelial and mural cell surface markers could be used in the prenatal
human brain. For embryonic mouse and adult human brain, different mural cell markers are
required since ANPEP is not highly expressed38 (also Fig. 3a,b).
 To contrast the different approaches, we compared our dissociation strategy and vascular
transcriptomics data with those obtained from three other recent studies that also characterize
human brain vascular cells5,6,9 (Table 1). Key differences include the use of fresh tissue to isolate
whole cells versus the use of frozen tissues for nuclei isolation. In the initial dissociation of
the tissue, some protocols use a refined approach with scalpels and microdissection, whereas
strategies with frozen tissue require homogenization. With respect to fresh tissues, we found

that enzymatic digestions are preferable to mechanical dissociation for vascular cells14,20,21
(Fig. 6a). However, choosing the correct enzyme that digests substrates of interest without
also cleaving important marker proteins requires optimization. We selected collagenase/
dispase for these reasons, since digestion of the basement membrane is critical14,20,21. We did
not find any dramatic improvements with the newer liberase enzymes (Fig. 6b), which are also
more expensive. Papain works well for isolation of neural cells, but fails to digest the vascular
basement membrane39. We also found very few vascular cells present after papain digestion
(Fig. 6c). Some protocols also use centrifugation and gradients to purify vascular cells.
We found that one 10 min Percoll step was sufficient to remove debris, and the vascular cells
could be identified with FACS. Further centrifugation steps were not required in our hands.
 FACS offers improved results compared with the vascular cells isolated with magnetic
beads. Beads are less efficient at capturing rare cells and therefore are more suitable for
enrichment of populations rather than purification (Fig. 6d). Finally, ANPEP is an excellent
marker for mural cells in the prenatal human brain, and does not have a magnetically conjugated
antibody at this time. Unconjugated antibodies require sequential purification steps, similar
to primary and secondary immunohistochemistry, which decrease yield further. We found that
50% of cells isolated with CD31 magnetic beads were CD31+ with flow cytometry but after three
sequential magnetic bead isolation steps, no ANPEP+ mural cells could be identified (Fig. 6d).
In addition, the vascular cells purified with our strategy are sufficiently healthy and robust to
permit long-term culture and passaging. This feature enables diverse and exciting potential
directions with primary human brain vascular cells.
 Since this protocol uses fresh tissue, postmortem interval (PMI) is critical to obtain
high-quality cells and data. On the basis of our experience, we observe that completing the
protocol within 24 h PMI is important for cell viability (Fig. 6e). Interestingly, while endothelial
cells from samples with greater than 24 h PMI are more sensitive and exhibit dramatic decreases

in yield and transcriptomic data, mural cells may be able to survive in cultures and produce
consistent transcriptomic data after this period (Fig. 6f).
 Another method to coculture acutely purified cells in a native microenvironment is
slice culture. The main advantages to the organoid approach include the ability to study
neurovascular interactions over longer periods of time and the robustness of the 3D
structure40,41. In addition, since the organoid protocol involves a stereotyped differentiation
process, the resulting neural cells are relatively homogeneous at a specific stage and provide
better experimental control32,42. In theory, like organoids in general, vascular cell transplants
can be maintained indefinitely. However, potential changes in the primary cells may occur due
to the in vitro environment.

Overview of the procedure
We present a detailed procedure covering the dissociation of prenatal brain tissue
and the isolation of cells (Steps 1–35) and the recovery of mural and endothelial cells
through FACS (Steps 46–55). This includes details on the preparation of control samples
using cells (Steps 36–40) and beads (Steps 41–45). Then, we describe how to culture
the FACS-purified cells (Steps 56–76), and characterize them with FACS (Steps 77–95).

Protocol extension


Alternatively, FACS-purified cells can be transplanted on top of organoids to study
neurovascular interactions (Steps 96–114). Finally, we offer thorough instructions on
bioinformatic pipelines to analyze scRNA-seq data (Steps 115−132).

Experimental design
To optimize these experiments, there are key considerations in regards to starting material
(brain tissue), flow cytometry, transcriptomics and organoid transplantation.

Starting material
This protocol as written is focused on fresh, nonfrozen, prenatal human brain tissue. Any brain
region may be selected; we have performed hundreds of experiments on both cortical and
subcortical regions, including the ganglionic eminences, due to our interest in angiogenic
and neurogenic interactions14. One key consideration is PMI. We have obtained high-quality
sequencing data from samples, which were procured within 24 h PMI, and were dissociated,
digested, purified with FACS, and completed the first stage of the 10x protocol (gem generation
and barcoding). In contrast, samples with more than 24 h PMI showed loss of endothelial cell
surface markers via FACS (Fig. 6e) and sequencing (Fig. 6f). Adult human brain endothelial
cells can be isolated with this protocol, but not mural cells (Fig. 3b). We have not attempted
to perform this protocol on frozen tissue, but other protocols are available for FACS-based
isolation of endothelial cell nuclei from fresh frozen tissue43.

Flow cytometry
Controls are a necessary part of any FACS experiment. Isotype controls should be included for
each fluorophore to ensure that the antibody is specific. In addition, each experiment requires
single-color controls to compensate the flow cytometry software. Fluorescence minus one
controls, in which every antibody except one is added, offer the most robust method to ensure
the population of interest is collected.

Transcriptomics
We obtained high-yield transcriptomic data starting with 1,000–10,000 cells per reaction for
the 10x Next GEM 3′ reagent kits version 3.1. More recent high-throughput kits can process
up to 20,000 starting cells. Each user should empirically determine the ‘event to cell ratio’
from their FACS machine by calculating the actual number of cells obtained after FACS and
comparing this with the event number derived from the machine. This calcuation will ensure
the transcriptomic reactions are starting with sufficient and not overwhelming amounts of RNA.
For sequencing depth, we used 50,000 reads per cell as recommended by 10x. The user could
employ sequencing saturation, based upon PCR duplicates in the 10x Cell Ranger software,
as a readout for whether more sequencing is desired. When analyzing the transcriptomic data,
there are many ways to assign cell type identities to clusters found through unsupervised
clustering. In this protocol, we employ two distinct methods: ScType and manual labeling.
ScType is a faster, more convenient and more reproducible labeling approach. This approach
is particularly useful when cell types are well characterized and have clear transcriptional
markers. Conversely, manual labeling allows for greater flexibility and control over the labeling
process. This approach is more suitable when dealing with potentially novel or rare cell types
that ScType might not detect.

Organoid transplants
For these experiments, we used a (dorsal) forebrain-directed organoid protocol to restrict the
organoids to cortex-like cells14. Unguided protocols, without manipulation of developmental
signaling molecules, lead to a mix of cells from different brain regions and are challenging to
use because they are not as reproducible/consistent44. Our transplantations were performed
at 7–9 weeks in culture because this stage corresponds to human brain development during
the second trimester32. We expect that the framework of this protocol should function well for
any time of brain organoid, but scientists who are interested in other brain regions or stages of
development may need to optimize their experiments. We used this experimental paradigm to

Nature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 612

Protocol extension


determine the effects of vascular cells on neural cells, and vice versa, after 2 weeks of coculture,
and have cultured transplanted endothelial and mural cells up to 4 weeks14. For controls, it is
important to include the transplantation of additional populations, either other FACS-purified
cells or a cell line. These controls will ensure that your results cannot be attributed to the effects
of any additional cells in the organoids. The commercially available 3T3 fibroblasts may be used
for this purpose.

Expertise needed to implement the protocol
Isolation and purification of the cells with flow cytometry requires expertise in running
the machines and setting up the software to correctly isolate the populations of interest.
Flow cytometry core facilities can often assist with these standard procedures. As written,
this protocol needs only four fluorescent markers plus DAPI or a different live/dead stain.
While additional markers can be added, this relatively simple panel serves as an achievable
foundation. The generation of cortical organoids is beyond the scope of this protocol32,45,46,
but the transplantation of primary brain vascular cells and their maintenance should be feasible
for anyone with experience in cell culture. Finally, the isolated cells can be used in infinite omics
applications depending on the current technology. We offer strategies for the initial stages of
transcriptomics data analysis based on our experience with common pitfalls, such as batch
correction.

Limitations
This protocol utilizes fresh tissues, which provides the advantage of being able to perform
whole-cell transcriptomics and culture of the cells after isolation. However, the tissues must
be processed quickly, within 24 h. We have not tested it extensively, but Miltenyi cell storage
solution has been developed to allow an optimized storage of fresh organ and tissue samples
up to 48 h (Miltenyi Biotech). This solution may be a reasonable alternative if samples cannot
be processed quickly. We have not tried our methodology on fresh frozen samples or postnatal
tissue, which may require a different approach. Although we can analyze adult human brain
endothelial cells with flow cytometry using this protocol14 (also Fig. 3b), we have not attempted
to culture or perform omics experiments on adult brain vascular cells. Our protocol requires
access to flow cytometry, although this technique is increasingly accessible9,38,47. In addition,
flow cytometry requires cell surface markers to purify and culture cells. Intracellular markers
may be feasible for analysis48, but the current staining procedures kill the cells. Finally, we
performed our experiments using 10x reagents, but there are emerging companies that also
offer transcriptomic reagents at potentially lower cost. The principles described in this protocol
should be applicable for a wide variety of omics experiments and vendor sources.


Materials

▲ Critical Downstream applications of cell dissociation/digestion/flow cytometry require
sterility. As such, we recommend all equipment and reagents be sterilized in accordance to
institutional guidelines. Specific recommendations for solutions are provided.
Biological material
 • Human brain tissue from pre- or postnatal ages. We have tested this protocol in first, second
 and third trimester tissue as well as adult human brain samples14.
 ▲ Caution Local institutional guidelines should always be followed when using human
 source materials since they can contain blood-borne pathogens. These protocols probably
 will include training, proper engineering and personal barrier protections.
 ▲ Caution Tissues should be acquired with strict adherence to local guidelines for human
 subjects protection, including institutional review board and/or Human Gamete, Embryo
 and Stem Cell Research Committee approval.
 ▲ Critical An equal number of male and female tissues should be studied to ensure
 applicability.

Nature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 613

Protocol extension


 ▲ Critical This protocol is optimized for enzymatic digestions of ~1 cm3 human
 brain tissue. If the enzyme cannot effectively digest the tissue due to an overwhelming
 amount of material, the dissociation will occur with mechanical digestion. Vascular cells
 in our experience are very sensitive to mechanical digestion and yield will be severely
 compromised. More starting material requires scaling up the reagents, number of tubes
 used for digestion and all subsequent steps (see the Troubleshooting advice for Step 54).

Procedure

● Timing ~2.5 h
Dissociation and digestion
● Timing ~1 h, add an additional 20 min per sample
1. Turn on rotating oven and allow it to heat up to 37 °C while you prepare your sample.
2. Obtain a 60 mm cell culture dish containing ~7 mL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.
3. Add 150 µL of pre-aliquoted DNase (10 mg/mL) to each dish.
4. Obtain ~250 mg of human brain tissue per sample. Document case details.
 ▲ Caution Local institutional guidelines should always be followed when using human
 source materials since they can contain blood-borne pathogens. These protocols probably
 will include training, proper engineering and personal barrier protections.
5. Place in dish containing HBSS/BSA/glucose + DNase.
 ▲ Critical step It is crucial DNase is added to the solution at this step otherwise digestion
 will be inadequate. See also the troubleshooting advice for Steps 9 and 54.
6. With a scalpel, cut tissue into small (~2 mm × 2 mm chunks) in HBSS/BSA/glucose + DNase
 solution in a sterile environment (Fig. 2).
 ▲ Critical step Ideally, dissection should occur in a cell culture biosafety cabinet. If this
 is not possible, the tissue can be dissected outside of a hood with attention paid to best
 aseptic technique.

7. Distribute tissue into three 15 mL conical tubes.
 • Aliquot the tissue–buffer solution in the dish into the tubes first
 • Use extra HBSS/BSA/glucose buffer to wash the dish and make up to
 5 mL per tube
8. Add 167 µL of collagenase/dispase (100 mg/mL) to each tube. Please note,
 167 µL of collagenase/dispase per 5 mL is equivalent to 33.4 µL of solution
 per 1 mL.
9. Digest for 30 min in rotating oven at 37 °C.
 ▲ Critical step Optimal enzymatic digestion is the most important factor
 to maximize yield. Therefore, this step may need optimizing to achieve
 sufficient but not too much digestion. See also the troubleshooting advice
 for Step 54.
 ◆ Troubleshooting
10. Spin down for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.

Percoll density gradient centrifugation
● Timing ~35 min
11. After samples have finished spinning, discard the supernatant by pouring out the liquid into
 a waste container.
 ▲ Critical step Do not aspirate the supernatant during the cell dissociation and
 digestion, as the cell pellet may be aspirated and lost.
12. Add 1 mL of HBSS/BSA/glucose and 50 µL of pre-aliquoted DNase (10 mg/mL) into each
 sample tube.
13. Gently mix/resuspend 50 times using a micropipette, taking care not to introduce bubbles,
 which may detrimentally affect the cells49.
14. Obtain two additional 15 mL conical tubes per each sample tube. For example, for three
 sample digestion tubes, obtain six tubes for Percoll filtration.
 ▲ Critical step Yield will be compromised if each digestion is not distributed into two
 Percoll tubes.
15. Dispense 4 mL of 22% Percoll into each new conical tube.
16. Carefully dispense cell suspension from each sample tube into the new conical tubes
 containing 22% Percoll in equal amounts. Use ~750 µL per tube.
 ▲ Critical step The cell suspension should be dispensed on top of
 the Percoll.
17. Spin down for 10 min at 500g, 4 °C with no deceleration.
18. Discard supernatant.
19. Reunite contents of all Percoll tubes into one tube by resuspending the cell pellet
 in the HBSS/BSA/glucose remaining after pouring out the supernatant.
20. Spin down the sample tube for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.
21. Do not discard the remaining tubes. The small amount of cells left over after combining
 the majority of cells into one tube for the master mix can be used for unstained and DAPI
 controls (Steps 36–45).

Master mix preparation
● Timing ~1–5 min
22. Add 200 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose into a fresh tube.
23. Add 2 µL of each antibody and 1 µL of DAPI into the tube containing 200 µL of HBSS/BSA/
 glucose per sample.

Immunostaining
● Timing ~30 min
24. After samples have finished spinning, discard supernatant.
25. Resuspend in ~200 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.
26. Add the master mix into the tube of resuspended cells.
27. Incubate for 15 min on ice. During this sample incubation, start preparing controls by
 following Steps 36–45.
28. Wash with 5 mL of HBSS/BSA/glucose and mix.
29. Spin down for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.
30. Discard supernatant.
 • Note the amount of supernatant remaining in the tube; 500 µL of supernatant is
 needed to resuspend
 • Add additional HBSS/BSA/glucose if below the recommended 500 µL needed to
 resuspend
31. Resuspend cells.
32. Obtain one FACS tube and a 70 µm filter.
33. With the filter over the FACS tube, dispense the resuspended cells through the filter and into
 the FACS tube.
34. Seal the tube and place on ice.
 ▲ Critical step Cells should be analyzed as soon as possible. Longer periods of
 dissociation may compromise cell viability.
35. Take samples to FACS.

Control (cell) tube preparation
● Timing ~5 min
▲ Critical A total of six controls are needed (see Step 43). We recommend only using cells for
the unstained and DAPI controls because they cannot be performed with beads. This strategy
does not waste cells on fluorescence controls and optimizes yield. However, if the user prefers
not to use beads, cells can be used for all controls. In that case, a small part of the sample should
be removed for control staining.
36. Obtain the three leftover 15 mL tubes after combining sample contents into one tube (Step 19).
37. Sequentially, rinse each tube with ~500 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose and combine into one tube.
38. Obtain six fresh FACS tubes and fresh 70 µm filters.
39. With the filters on top of the FACS tubes, dispense 250 µL of combined buffer rinse into two
 of the FACS tubes.
40. Proceed to Step 41.

Control (beads) tube preparation and immunostaining
● Timing ~5 min
41. Dispense 250 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose into each of the four remaining FACS tubes.

 tube in HBSS/BSA/glucose.
42. Add 2.5 µL of a single antibody to each single-color control tube into the FACS tubes
 containing 250 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.
43. For the live/dead stain, add 1.25 µL of DAPI into the FACS tubes containing 250 µL
 of combined buffer/cell rinse. One tube will be unstained.

44. After adding antibodies as explained in Step 43, shake the UltraComp eBead
 vial and add one drop of beads to each single-color control with the ‘Ready to Use’
 bottle. Please note, beads are designed to bind antibodies and eliminate the need
 to use cells for many controls. Therefore, do not add beads to DAPI and unstained
 controls. If cells are being used for all controls, then do not add beads to any of
 the controls.
45. Seal the tubes and place on ice.

FACS
● Timing ~2 h
▲ Critical Every flow cytometry system will have slightly different procedures. Here are
high-yield principles to execute a successful flow cytometry experiment.
46. Set the laser levels for each of your fluorophores with unstained and single-color controls.
47. Once the laser levels are set, then run the single-color controls again to record each
 fluorophore. After every single-color control has been run, the machine can perform
 compensation, the method of correcting for fluorescence spill over.
48. Once the laser levels are set and compensation performed, the user can draw gates to select
 sequential populations (Fig. 3a). For this strategy, we recommend first eliminating debris
 with side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) gates. These are size and complexity
 parameters.
49. Next, eliminate doublets also with SSC or FSC.
50. Eliminate dead cells. We use DAPI but a number of live/dead stains exist in different
 fluorophores.
51. After eliminating debris, doublets and dead cells, then the user should set up
 FACS plots to select their population of interests. In our studies, endothelial
 cells were isolated as CD45−CD31+ANPEP− and mural cells were isolated as
 CD45−CD31−ANPEP+.
52. (Optional) Run additional controls to determine the true population. These may include
 ‘fluorescence minus one’ controls and unstained controls.
53. After the population has been defined, use a 100 µm nozzle to perform cell sorting.
 ▲ Critical step A smaller filter may damage the cells.
54. Translate the ‘event number’ readout from the cell sorter into a true cell number,
 a parameter termed ‘efficiency’21. This calculation may be necessary for downstream
 applications.
 ◆ Troubleshooting
55. After sorting several downstream procedures can be performed:
 • Follow Steps 56–95 for 2D culture of purified mural and endothelial cells.
 3D culture or metabolic measurements can also be performed as described
 previously14
 • Follow Steps 96–114 for the transplantation of cells into brain organoids
 • Follow Steps 115–132 for single-cell transcriptomic analysis

Plating cells
● Timing ~1 h
Collagen coating
● Timing ~35 min
56. Obtain a 24-well plate.
57. Calculate the amount of collagen coating solution needed. We recommend 500 µL of
 collagen coating solution (0.03 mg/mL) per well.
58. Add 500 µL of collagen coating solution (0.03 mg/mL) into each well.
59. Incubate plate with collagen for 30 min at 37 °C.
60. After incubation, remove collagen coating solution from all wells.
61. Wash wells once with 1× PBS and then they are ready to use (if not using immediately,
 keep PBS in the wells and store in 37 °C incubator until the sorted cells are ready to
 be plated).

Plating
● Timing ~10 min
62. Spin down sorted mural and/or endothelial cell tubes (from Step 54) by centrifuging for
 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.
63. After spinning, remove supernatant from microcentrifuge tubes containing cells.
64. Add 500 µL of prewarmed (37 °C) growth medium into microcentrifuge tubes containing
 mural or endothelial cell pellets.
65. Resuspend.
66. Add the desired amount of cell solution into collagen-coated wells. We recommend filling
 each culture well with cell solution to approximately half volume.
67. Add additional 500 µL of growth medium into wells containing cells for 1 mL total
 per well.
68. Add 500 µL of 1× PBS to all other empty wells to keep them from drying.
69. Place in a 37 °C incubator.

Cell culture
Changing media
● Timing ~10 min
70. Determine the amount of EGM-2 medium required for passaging based on plates and/or
 wells required. Aliquot endothelial cell growth medium in a 50 mL conical tube.
71. Obtain plates with cells from 37 °C incubator.
72. Place new tip on vacuum. Aspirate the old growth medium from the plates.
73. Using a serological pipette, add 1× PBS to each plate. For a 24-well plate, we recommend
 0.5 mL per well. Swirl each plate, then vacuum off the majority of PBS.
 ◆ Troubleshooting
74. Using another serological pipette, add fresh growth medium to each plate. For a 24-well
 plate, we recommend 0.5 mL per well. Swirl each plate once.
75. Place plates back into the 37 °C incubator.
76. Repeat Steps 70–75 to change media approximately every other day. Monitor confluency
 and when confuency has reached 75–80%, proceed to passaging (Step 77).
 ◆ Troubleshooting

Passaging and FACS
● Timing ~30 min plus FACS
▲ Critical Ideal cell confluency for high-yield FACS and cell health is 75–80% plate coverage.
77. Aliquot endothelial cell growth medium in a 50 mL conical tube.
78. Obtain plates with cells from 37 °C incubator.
79. Place new tip on vacuum. Vacuum out the old growth medium from the plates.
 ◆ Troubleshooting
80. Using a serological pipette, add 1× PBS to each plate. For a 24-well plate, we recommend
 0.5 mL per well. Swirl each plate, then vacuum out the PBS.
 ◆ Troubleshooting
81. Using another serological pipette, add 0.5 mL of trypsin to each well. Swirl each plate once.
82. Place plates back into the 37 °C incubator.
83. In ~5 min, remove the plates from the incubator.
84. View the plates under the microscope. Ensure that cells are no longer adhered to the bottom
 of the plate. Tap the bottom of the plates if necessary.
 ▲ Critical step Ensure that cells are beginning to round up before attempting to dislodge
 them from the plate. If cells are over-digested, their viability will be compromised. If cells
 are not sufficiently digested, then they will not come up from the plate.
 ◆ Troubleshooting
85. Set up the appropriate number of 15 mL conical tubes (one tube per well).
86. Add 1 mL of the HBSS/BSA/glucose buffer to each 15 mL conical tube (or 6 mL to each
 50 mL tube).
87. Tap the bottom of plates once again to ensure cells are not stuck on the bottom.

88. Gently tilt each plate and remove trypsin and cells using a serological pipette. Add to the
 appropriate conical tube containing the HBSS/BSA/glucose buffer.
89. Wash the plate one more time with 1 mL HBSS/BSA/glucose buffer to catch remaining cells,
 then discard empty plates.
90. Spin down tubes for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.
91. To validate cell-surface marker expression of the vascular cells for downstream
 assays, perform FACS as in Steps 46–54 (Fig. 4b). Otherwise proceed directly to
 Step 93.

Replating
● Timing ~10 min
92. Spin down tubes containing sorted cells for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.
93. Discard supernatant and add growth medium to tubes containing the pellet of cells so the
 total tube volume is 1 mL. For one well of a 24-well plate, we recommend 20,000–30,000
 cells, which should become confluent within 5 d.
94. Add growth medium to each plate. Place into incubator.
 ◆ Troubleshooting
95. Repeat Steps 56–94 to maintain cells in 2D culture. Alternatively:
 • Follow Steps 96–114 for the transplantation of cells into brain organoids
 • Follow Steps 115–132 for single-cell transcriptomic analysis
 • The cells can also be used in Matrigel 3D angiogenesis cultures or metabolic studies
 (such as Seahorse assays)14

Organoids
Cell transplant
● Timing ~2 h
▲ Critical Grow and maintain organoids as described previously32,44,45. We perform
transplantations after the organoids have been differentiated and maintained for 7–9 weeks.
Each user will need to determine their targeted neural population for vascular cell coculture and
grow the organoids to that stage.
96. Collect mural and/or endothelial cells sorted in Step 54.
97. Immediately after sorting, infect the cell population of interest with AAV–CMV–
 GFP. Mix the cell solution thoroughly using a pipette. We use 1 µL (stock titer of
 1 × 1013 GF/mL; 200 multiplicity of infection (MOI)) for 50,000 cells. Place cells at 37 °C
 for 30 min.
98. To avoid viral leakage into the organoids, wash cells three times with 1× PBS, each time
 spinning down at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C.

Nature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 621

 99. Select organoids for transplantation. Preferred organoids should display spherical shape
 and clear edges without any cell debris. Organoids vary in size, so a variety of organoid
 sizes will be used within a given experimental condition; ensure that you distribute
 different sizes across conditions.
100. Using a wide-opening pipette tip, move number of desired organoids onto Millicell culture
 inserts in a 6-well flat-bottom plate. Transwells help prevent the organoid from moving
 as the vascular cells are incorporated during the transplants. We recommend three to six
 organoids per condition.
 ▲ Critical step Use a wide-opening p1000 µL pipette tip to maintain the organoid
 structure.
 ◆ Troubleshooting
101. Immediately before adding cells, gently remove as much medium surrounding the
 organoids within the well as possible using a p1000 pipette.
102. Gently add desired amount of cells on top of the organoids and incubate at 37 °C for
 30 min.
 ▲ Critical step Per organoid, we recommend not adding more than 50 µL to ensure that
 the cells stay on top of the organoid initially and do not float away.
103. After incubation, gently add medium to well insert until the organoid floats off of the
 insert, ~3 mL.
104. Maintain organoids in a 37 °C incubator. The transwell can be removed the day after
 transplantation. After transplantation, maintain the organoids submerged in medium.
 Change media three times a week for up to 2 weeks, or the duration of the transplantation
 experiments (Fig. 5b, day 1, stage 1). When transplantation experiments are complete, if
 samples need to be prepared for frozen sectioning proceed to Step 105.
 ◆ Troubleshooting

Freezing
● Timing ~8 h
▲ Critical For an overview of the workflow, see Fig. 5b.
105. After 2 weeks and using wide-opening pipette tips, transfer organoids to a 24-well
 flat-bottom plate and aspirate excess medium. Up to six organoids can be transferred
 per well. PBS washing before fixation is not necessary (Fig. 5b, day 1, stages 2, 3).
 ▲ Critical step Do not combine different conditions or transfer types into the
 same well.
106. Add 0.5–1 mL of 4% PFA to the organoid wells to cover organoids. Leave the organoids
 for 30 min at room temperature (Fig. 5b, day 1, stage 4).
107. Remove PFA with a pipette and wash with 0.5–1 mL 1× PBS three times for 10 min (Fig. 5b,
 day 1, stage 5).
108. Remove PBS with a pipette and resuspend in 0.5–1 mL 30% sucrose. Store overnight
 (or ~6 h) at 4 °C until organoids sink to the bottom of the well (Fig. 5b, day 1, Step 6).
 Please note that the incubation will depend on organoid size; larger organoids take
 longer to sink.
109. Remove excess sucrose from wells and replace with 0.5–1 mL 50/50 mix of 30% sucrose and
 blue OCT. Store overnight (or ~6 h) at 4 °C (Fig. 5b, day 2, stages 7 and 8).
110. Remove excess 50/50 sucrose/OCT mix and resuspend in 0.5–1 mL clear OCT.
111. Fill embedding blocks with OCT and label appropriately
112. Using wide-opening tips, gently pipette out organoids and place in embedding blocks
 (Fig. 5b, day 3, stages 9 and 10).
 ◆ Troubleshooting
113. Use a pipette tip to help them sink to the bottom of the OCT and place on dry ice (Fig. 5b,
 day 3, stage 11).
114. Store in a −80 °C freezer until time for sectioning. We use standard procedures to section
 samples and for subsequent analysis using immunofluorescence14.
 ■ Pause point Slides may be kept at −80 °C for up to 1 year without compromising
 their quality.

scRNA-seq
Single-cell library preparation
● Timing ~8 h
115. Collect mural and/or endothelial cells sorted in Step 54. Immediately after sorting, begin
 library preparation.
116. Perform library preparation using a 10x Genomics Chromium Next GEM single cell
 3′ reagent kit based on the manufacturer’s instructions. For our experiments, we used
 v3.1 10x Genomics kits.

Sequencing
● Timing varies (can be a few hours to a few days depending on the instrument).
117. Perform qPCR-based quantification, fragment analysis and sequencing (our prepared
 libraries were sent to the UCSF Institute for Human Genetics Genomics Core to do this):
 • Perform qPCR-based quantification to determine the concentration of each library
 using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina Platforms
 • Determine sequencing depth based on your desired coverage for each library.
 10x Genomics recommends sequencing a minimum of 20,000 reads/cell for most
 single-cell 3′ gene expression libraries
 • After using the 10x Genomics reagent kits to prepare your libraries, perform
 paired-end sequencing using Illumina’s constructs
118. Obtain sequenced files in FASTQ format, ready for downstream bioinformatic analysis.
 ◆ Troubleshooting

Analysis of scRNA-seq data
Aligning FASTQ files and generating feature-barcode matrices using Cell Ranger
● Timing varies depending on computing power
▲ Critical For downstream analysis, FASTQ files must be aligned to a reference transcriptome
and converted into feature–barcode matrices, also known as count matrices. 10x Genomics
provides Cell Ranger, a collection of analysis pipelines, to process its Chromium single-cell data.
Cellranger count is a pipeline within Cell Ranger that aligns sequencing reads in FASTQ files to a
reference transcriptome and generates feature–barcode matrices.
119. Using the cellranger count pipeline, align FASTQ files to the reference transcriptome of
 interest and generate count matrices for each sample.
 • We used the human reference transcriptome GRCh38 for our sequencing reads.
 Species-relevant transcriptomes are available for download from the 10x Genomics
 website or a comparable resource
 • A more detailed description of the cellranger count pipeline can be found at https://

Preprocessing of scRNA-seq data using Seurat in R
● Timing varies depending on computing power
120. Seurat is an R package that offers methods for quality control, analysis and exploration of
 scRNA-seq data50. Using the Read10x function within Seurat, import the feature–barcode
 matrices for each sample into R. A guided tutorial on clustering data with Seurat can be
 found at https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html
121. Convert each feature–barcode matrix into individual Seurat objects using the
 CreateSeuratObject function within Seurat. Note that once a seurat object is created
 for a given sample, any additional sample information (e.g., age of the collected
 sample, brain region, etc.) can be added to the metadata of that seurat object. One can
 add this information using: samplefilename@meta.data[“Columnname”] <- “sample
 information”.
122. Filter out low-quality cells. We filtered using the following criteria:
 • Greater than 200 unique genes (features) detected in each cell. Empty droplets or dead
 cells will have very few genes, while doublets will have many

Nature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 623

Protocol extension


 • Greater than 500 unique molecular identifiers detected in each cell. Empty droplets or
 dead cells will have very few unique molecular identifiers
 • Less than 10% mitochondrial reads in each cell. A high mitochondrial percentage in a
 given cell typically indicates cellular stress or damage
 Our workflow to filter out low-quality cells is adapted from guidelines provided by the
 Harvard Bioinformatics core (https://github.com/hbctraining/scRNA-seq_online/tree/
 master/lessons).
123. If necessary, combine multiple datasets using the merge function within Seurat.
124. Perform data normalization using the NormalizeData function within Seurat.
125. Identify highly variable features using the FindVariableFeatures function within
 Seurat and specify the selection method. We used the default method (vst) and default
 number of variable features (2,000) to identify 2,000 highly variable genes for this
 dataset.
126. Scale data using the ScaleData function within Seurat

Dimensionality reduction and clustering
● Timing varies depending on computing power
127. Run principal component analysis with all high variable genes found in Step 125. Selecting
 the number of principal components to add to the Uniform Manifold Approximation
 and Projection (UMAP) analysis can be done using Jackstraw plot analysis to remove any
 principal components that are negligible51.
128. If necessary, perform batch correction. We recommend Harmony, which uses an
 iterative clustering approach to account for batch effects arising from multiple
 samples. Harmony can be run within our Seurat workflow based on the standard
 integration pipeline in Harmony’s documentation. A guided tutorial on removing
 batch effects with Harmony can be found at https://github.com/immunogenomics/
 harmony.
 ◆ Troubleshooting
129. Perform unsupervised clustering using Seurat’s FindNeighbors and FindClusters
 functions. The FindClusters function allows one to control the resolution of
 clustering, where a higher resolution value leads to a larger number of smaller
 clusters, while a lower resolution value leads to a smaller number of larger clusters.
 This parameter needs to be optimized for each dataset, depending on the desired
 specificity for cell type identification. For our dataset, the optimal resolution
 was 0.5. We selected a resolution that produced well separated and biologically
 meaningful clusters.
130. Visualize clusters via UMAP using Seurat package.

Labeling clusters
● Timing ~1.5 h
131. Labeling using ScType. Run the ScType package to label clusters using a reference
 database of cell type signatures. This package offers several reference databases for
 labeling, covering various tissues and cell types; however, one can also create their own
 reference database. We created a reference database specific to our cell types of interest
 based on gene sets from the literature. A more detailed description of the ScType package
 can be found at https://github.com/IanevskiAleksandr/sc-type.
132. Alternatively, manual labeling can be used. Similar to ScType, this method involves
 identifying marker genes for each cluster and comparing them with known cell-type
 signatures. To manually label clusters using Seurat:
 • Identify marker genes using the FindAllMarkers function within Seurat
 • Using the writexl package create an excel file with your marker genes by cluster
 • Compare the marker genes from each cluster with known cell type signatures from the
 literature or reference databases
 • Assign labels to each cluster based on the best match with the known cell type
 signatures using the RenameIdents function within Seurat

 cells are digested, some of them will lyse and naked DNA will be present in
 the solution. This DNA is sticky and can damage cells with trituration if DNase
 is not present
54 Poor yields from FACS Digestion was inadequate Vascular cells are very sensitive to mechanical dissociation38 (Fig. 6a). If
 poor yields are obtained, we recommend scrutinizing the digestion for any
 problems first before pointing to other steps. If the enzymatic digestion is
 incomplete, the cells can be dissociated mechanically but the yields will
 decrease. The digestion may be suboptimal because too much tissue is
 placed in each digestion tube, because the enzyme is too old or has had
 repeated freeze–thaw cycles and is inactive, or because the tissue was not
 agitated or rotated with digestion and the enzyme was not well distributed

Timing

In our experience, tissue dissociation and digestion will take ~3 h when starting with a piece of
tissue ~1 cm3. Larger pieces of tissue will probably require more time because the procedure
must be scaled up proportionally (please see troubleshooting). FACS, including establishing
compensation with controls, requires another 3 h. The endothelial and mural cells can be placed
in culture immediately after FACS. The procedures for organoid transplants will require an
additional 2 h.

Anticipated results

When starting with ~1 cm3 of tissue, ~30,000 endothelial cell events and 100,000 mural cell
events should be obtained after FACS. Once the cells are placed in culture, they will initially
double in ~5 d (passage 1), and then decrease their doubling time (subsequent passages,
Fig. 4a). Mural cells in general are more proliferative than endothelial. In regards to the choice
of CD31 and ANPEP as cell surface markers for flow cytometry, respectively, we find that they
are suitable ‘pan’ endothelial and mural cell markers based on the following criteria: (1) all
the endothelial and mural cell subtypes are captured14 and (2) other human brain scRNA-seq
datasets do not find expression of these markers in nonvascular cells in prenatal22 or adult
human brain6,9. We also did not find vascular genes expressed in other cell populations (Fig. 3c).
Of note, we and others6,9 find that the human brain has more mural cells than endothelial, in
contrast to the adult mouse brain20. Endothelial cells also seem to be more delicate and sensitive
to PMI (Fig. 6e,f). If cells purified as endothelial cells do not express bona fide endothelial cell

markers at the transcriptomic level, consider whether your protocol is too harsh or the PMI was
too long.
 For organoid transplants, vascular cells should integrate into the organoids quickly. GFP
turns on within 24 h and can be visualized easily within 3 d. Unfortunately, we have not found
other methods of visualization to be helpful: we do not see morphological differences on
brightfield microscopy, for example. Since adenoviruses do not integrate into DNA, the GFP
expression is these experiments is not stable. If the cells divide, the signal is depleted over time.
In nondividing cells, expression is maintained for the life of the cell. We did not observe CD34 or
PDGFR-β in cells that did not express GFP in our experiments after 2 weeks14 (also Fig. 5c).
 In our experiments, the organoid environment enriched for one dominant endothelial
and mural cell subtype14, but alternative culture conditions may enrich for different subtypes.
Of note, it is important to perform experiments to determine that endothelial and mural cells
maintain their identity upon transplantation, as organoids have transcriptomic differences,
including cellular stress, that may lead to phenotypic differences in vascular cells32. This could
be determined via immunohistochemistry or RNAscope. We performed immunohistochemistry
for CD34 for endothelial cells and PDGFR-β for mural cells14 before proceeding with
experiments to determine their subtypes and their effects on neural cells (Fig. 5c). We and
others have consistently found that vascular cells influence neural cell differentiation and
proliferation in culture and in organoids2,14,20. Given the pervasiveness of these effects in
different model systems, we would anticipate these results across a variety of neurovascular
interactions. However, probing specific stages of neurovascular interactions may reveal new
discoveries. In addition, vascular cells should improve cell stress in the organoids14.
