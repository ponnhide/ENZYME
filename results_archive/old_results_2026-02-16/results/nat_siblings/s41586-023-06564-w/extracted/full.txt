 The assembly of cortical circuits involves the generation and migration of interneurons

 spectrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have been
 associated with abnormal cortical interneuron development5, but which of these NDD
 genes affect interneuron generation and migration, and how they mediate these
 effects remains unknown. We previously developed a platform to study interneuron
 development and migration in subpallial organoids and forebrain assembloids6. Here
 we integrate assembloids with CRISPR screening to investigate the involvement of 425
 NDD genes in human interneuron development. The first screen aimed at interneuron
 generation revealed 13 candidate genes, including CSDE1 and SMAD4. We subsequently
 conducted an interneuron migration screen in more than 1,000 forebrain assembloids
 that identified 33 candidate genes, including cytoskeleton-related genes and the
 endoplasmic reticulum-related gene LNPK. We discovered that, during interneuron
 migration, the endoplasmic reticulum is displaced along the leading neuronal branch
 before nuclear translocation. LNPK deletion interfered with this endoplasmic reticulum
 displacement and resulted in abnormal migration. These results highlight the power
 of this CRISPR-assembloid platform to systematically map NDD genes onto human
 development and reveal disease mechanisms.


Defects in the development and function of cortical GABAergic self-organizing organoids resembling the ventral forebrain–human
(γ-aminobutyric acid-releasing) interneurons have been implicated subpallial organoids (hSO), from human induced pluripotent stem
in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental (hiPS) cells6,16,17. These organoids can be integrated with human cortidisorders (NDDs)5. This is primarily based on the high prevalence of cal organoids (hCO) to form human forebrain assembloids (hFA) and

 Sample size Sample sizes were estimated empirically, based on previous studies (Birey et al., Nature 2017; Marton et al., Nature Neuroscience; Pasca et al,
 Nature Medicine 2019; Yoon et al., Nature Methods 2019; Miura et al., Nature Biotechnology 2020; Han et al., Nature 2019; Birey et al., Cell
 Stem Cell 2022).

 Data exclusions When analyzing the percentage of saltatory migrating cells that showed ER displacement, 4 images containing densely packed fast-moving
 cells that are different from other collected images were excluded. In addition, organoids having less than 3 migrating cells were not included.

 Replication Data shown in representative experiments was repeated with similar results in at least 3 independent experiments. All attempts at replication
 were successful. Sample sizes for other experiments were indicated in Figure legends. Data in Extended Data Fig. 10 e-h was collected from
 multiple organoids in one differentiation and part of these results verified findings in Fig. 3h and Fig. 4 f-i. NGS validation of the deletion of
 the candidate genes was performed once as it is standard practice and results were consistent with PCR genotyping experiments.

 Randomization Organoids and assembloids were randomly picked from cell culture plates for each assay. For the experiment used mouse tissues, mouse
 brain slices were randomly grouped for control and experimental treatment.

 Blinding Blinding of genotypes was used for all imaging analysis, flow cytometry analysis, and organoid size measurements. Blinding was not used or

Flow Cytometry
Plots
 Confirm that:
 The axis labels state the marker and fluorochrome used (e.g. CD4-FITC).
 The axis scales are clearly visible. Include numbers along axes only for bottom left plot of group (a 'group' is an analysis of identical markers).
 All plots are contour plots with outliers or pseudocolor plots.
 A numerical value for number of cells or percentage (with statistics) is provided.

Methodology
 Sample preparation Organoids (single organoids cultured in a 96-well plate or up to 8 organoids cultured in a 6-well plate) were incubated with an
 enzyme solution containing 10U/ml papain (Worthington, LS003127), 1x EBSS (Sigma-Aldrich, E7510-500ML), 0.36% D(+)-
 Glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), 26 mM NaHCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich), DNase (Worthington, LS002007), 6.1
 mM L-Cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich), and the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μM) at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 15 min; this solution was
 pre-warmed at 37°C for 30 minutes to activate papain, and then cells were washed with a pre-warmed protease inhibitor
 solution (1x EBSS, 0.36% D(+)-Glucose, 26 mM NaHCO3, 0.2% trypsin inhibitor (Worthington LS003086)). Organoids were
 then triturated, and the resulting single cell suspension was centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes. The pellet was
 resuspended with 3% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and then filtered.
 hiPS cells were dissociated with accutase and filtered before sorting.

 Instrument BD FACS Aria II and ACEA NovoCyte Quanteon 4205.

 Software BD FACSDiva Software for FACS, and NovoExpress software for analyzing the percentage of GFP positive cells. FlowJo was
 used for data analysis.

 Cell population abundance The purity of the sample were determined by either GFP or mCherry fluorescence.

 Gating strategy In all the sorting and analysis experiments, a similar differentiation or hiPS cells without any fluorescence were used as
 negative control to set the gate.

 Tick this box to confirm that a figure exemplifying the gating strategy is provided in the Supplementary Information.
