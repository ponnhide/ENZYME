Organoid generation and cultures. Colonic epithelial organoid lines were derived as previously described56,57. Brieﬂy, crypts of the healthy portion of the colonic epithelium (at least 10 cm away from the tumor side) were isolated by digestion of the intestinal mucosa in chelation solution (5.6 mM Na2HPO4, 8.0 mM KH2PO4, 96.2 mM NaCl, 1.6 mM KCl, 43.4 mM Sucrose, and 54.9 mM D-Sorbitol, Sigma) supplemented with dithiotreitol (0.5 mM, Sigma) and EDTA (2 mM, in-house) for 30 min at 4 °C. Colonic crypts were subsequently plated in basement membrane extract (BME; Cultrex PC BME RGF type 2, Amsbio). Organoids were grown in human intestinal stem cell medium (HISCM), which is composed of Advanced Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium/F12 supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES and Glutamax (all Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 50% Wnt3a conditioned medium (in-house), 20% R-Spondin1 conditioned medium (in-house), 10% Noggin conditioned medium (in-house), 1x B27, 1.25 mM N-acetylcysteine, 10 mM nicotinamide, 50 ng/ml human EGF, 10 nM Gastrin, 500 nM A83-01, 10 nM prostaglandin E2 and 100 µg/ml Primocin (Invivogen).
