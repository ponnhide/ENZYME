Wimmer 1*, Alexandra Leopoldi1, Martin Aichinger2,3, Dontscho Kerjaschki4 and\n Josef M. Penninger1,5*\n Blood vessels are fundamental to animal life and have critical roles in many diseases, such as stroke, myocardial infarction\n and diabetes. The vasculature is formed by endothelial cells that line the vessel and are covered with mural cells,\n speciﬁcally pericytes in smaller vessels and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) in larger-diameter vessels. Both\n endothelial cells and mural cells are essential for proper blood vessel function and can be derived from human pluripotent\n stem cells (hPSCs). Here, we describe a protocol to generate self-organizing 3D human blood vessel organoids from\n hPSCs that exhibit morphological, functional and molecular features of human microvasculature. These organoids are\n differentiated via mesoderm induction of hPSC aggregates and subsequent differentiation into endothelial networks and\n pericytes in a 3D collagen I–Matrigel matrix. Blood vessels form within 2–3 weeks and can be further grown in scalable\n suspension culture.

In the adult, blood vessel dysfunction is linked to major diseases such as\n stroke, heart attack, diabetes or cancer1. Blood vessels are composed of endothelial cells, which\n provide the inner lining and form the luminal tubes, and mural cells such as pericytes or vSMCs,\n which cover the outer endothelial wall of small and large vessels. During development, endothelial\n cells arise from mesodermal progenitors under the stimulus of ﬁbroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2),\n bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and\n organize into primitive tubular networks, a process called vasculogenesis2–4. Subsequently, during the\n process of angiogenesis, this primitive plexus remodels and new vessels sprout and branch until a\n mature circulatory network is formed5. This process requires endothelial cells to specify into tip cells,\n which are highly migratory endothelial cells leading the newly forming vessel, and stalk cells, which\n follow the tip cell, and, through proliferation, contribute to vessel growth5. Stalk cells establish the\n actual lumen for blood transport through various mechanisms such as vacuolar fusion, inverse\n membrane blebbing and cord hollowing6,7.\n Both processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are highly dependent on VEGF-A signaling,\n which has a key role in regulating endothelial cell proliferation and survival8. Depending on the\n organ, mural cells can arise from mesoderm, neural crest or epicardial cells9. In the case of meso-\n dermal pericytes (e.g., heart, lung and gut pericytes) and endothelial cells, both can arise from a\n common mesodermal, ﬂk-1 (VEGFR-2) positive progenitor cell10. During the process of angiogenesis,\n the highly invasive tip cells of newly growing vessels recruit mural cells by platelet-derived growth\n factor beta (PDGF-B) release. In a paracrine manner, PDGF-B stimulates PDGF receptor beta\n (PDGFR-β) on the surface of developing mural cells, leading to the maturation and proliferation of\n pericytes and vSMCs9,11. The interaction between endothelial cells and mural cells stimulates the\n formation of a basement membrane and vessel quiescence and is essential for vascular development\n and blood vessel homeostasis12–14.\n In this protocol we describe how to generate human blood vessel organoids, composed of\n endothelial cells and pericytes, from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)15.

The protocol is\n based on a stepwise differentiation of hPSC aggregates with sequential changing of culture media and further\n differentiation into vascular networks in a 3D matrix. After aggregate formation in the presence of Y-27632,\n differentiation is initiated using CHIR99021 and BMP-4 to induce mesoderm, followed by VEGF-A and forskolin\n treatment to trigger vascular development. Aggregates are embedded in a collagen I–Matrigel matrix and stimulated\n with 15% FBS, VEGF-A and FGF-2 for vascular network formation (see upper illustration). Single vascular networks\n are extracted from the gel to generate blood vessel organoids that can be transplanted into NSG mice. A 3D\n reconstruction of a CD31-stained vascular organoid is displayed in the lower panel (scale bar, 200 μm) alongside an\n illustration of several vascular networks.\n\n\n induction, endothelial networks are formed by vessel sprouting and mature into stable blood vessels\n covered by pericytes and enveloped by a basement membrane. We have previously demonstrated that\n when these blood vessel organoids are transplanted into mice they form a stable and functional\n human vasculature15.\n\n\n Development of the protocol\n During development, vascular progenitors, which can give rise to endothelial and mural cells, emerge\n from lateral and posterior mesoderm10. Previous protocols described highly efﬁcient differentiation of\n hPSCs into mesoderm by WNT activation and BMP-4 stimulation, as well as further differentiation\n into endothelial cells upon VEGF-A exposure or into the pericyte/vSMC lineage upon exposure to\n PDGF-B or stimulation by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling16–28. Co-culture of\n separately differentiated endothelial cells and pericytes in 2D, as well as culture of early vascular\n progenitor cells in 3D, has been used previously to generate endothelial/pericyte networks18–20.\n We recently demonstrated the direct differentiation of hPSCs into self-assembling blood vessel\n organoids15. Starting from hPSC aggregates, WNT activation (GSK3β inhibition by CHIR99021) and\n BMP-4 stimulation induced the mesodermal fate. Subsequently VEGF-A and FGF-2 were used to\n induce the vascular cell fate. Those aggregates directly differentiated and grew into a sprouting\n vasculature in 3D collagen I–Matrigel gels driven by VEGF-A and FGF-2 stimulation in the presence\n of serum. Highly branched endothelial networks were generated within 11 d, starting from self-\n renewing hPSCs. Endothelial tubes form a lumen, show tight interaction with pericytes and are\n covered by a continuous basement membrane. Furthermore, cells reminiscent of the tip cell phe-\n notype, characterized by excessive ﬁlopodia formation, can be observed at the angiogenic front of\n sprouting aggregates. We were able to further dissect the vascular networks under a stereomicroscope\n into single blood vessel organoids that could be kept in suspension culture in a 96-well format, which\n allowed for high-throughput screen approaches (Figs. 1 and 2). Differentiated blood vessel organoids\n could be transplanted as a whole into the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice. In mice,\n blood vessel organoids gained access to the mouse vasculature and formed a fully human (endothelial\n cell + mural cell) vasculature in vivo that was stable for >6 months (the end of our observation\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 14 | NOVEMBER 2019 | 3082–3100 | www.nature.com/nprot 3083\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n a Day −1 (Step 1)\n b Day 0 (Step 11)\n c Day 5 (Step 18)\n d Day 8 (Step 36)\n e Failed\n\n Survival\n\n\n f Day 10 (Step 37) g h i\n Differentiation\n\n\n j Day 10 (i) k Day 12 l Day 15 m\n Day 15\n\n\nFig. 2 | Bright-ﬁeld images of hPSC differentiation into vascular networks and blood vessel organoids. a, Typical morphology of an hPSC (NC8)\ncolony cultured on Matrigel and in E8 medium at day −1. b, hPSC aggregates on day 0 in the presence of Y-27632. c, Differentiated cell aggregates at\nday 5, before embedding of aggregates into the 3D collagen I–Matrigel matrix. d, At day 8, aggregates show extensive radial sprouting in response to\nVEGF-A, FGF-2 and FBS. e, Examples of failed differentiation.

In contrast to previous protocols26, vascular organoid transplantation does not require the\n co-transplantation of mouse mesenchymal cells to form a long-lasting vasculature. This is, to our\n knowledge, the ﬁrst detailed protocol for the generation of functional arteries, arterioles and venules\n from hPSCs.\n\n\n Alternative methods for generating vascular networks\n Several studies in which vascular networks were generated from hPSCs have been reported. For\n instance, Orlova et al.19 established 2D co-cultures of hPSC-derived endothelial cells and pericytes. In\n this setup, endothelial cells ﬁrst form islands that are surrounded by pericytes and then remodel into\n vessel-like structures, mimicking the formation of a primary vascular plexus. This co-culture\n approach allows the study of endothelial network formation and endothelial cell–pericyte interactions\n in a cell-autonomous manner. For example, if the affected vascular cell type of a disease is unknown,\n co-cultures enable the combination of healthy or patient-derived endothelial cells with pericytes\n from either healthy or affected donors. In blood vessel organoids and protocols that use common\n progenitor cells of endothelial cells and pericytes18, endothelial networks and pericytes are genetically\n identical. However, blood vessel organoids are fully 3D and recapitulate not only endothelial net-\n works and endothelial cell–pericyte interactions but also the formation of a vascular lumen and\n basement membrane deposition.\n Kusuma et al.18 used a synthetic hyaluronic acid-based matrix to differentiate early vascular cells,\n deﬁned as CD105+CD146+, into multicellular networks containing endothelial cells and pericytes.\n Those networks could be transplanted into mice, where the endothelial cells and pericytes integrated\n into the host vasculature. Although the approach of using a synthetic hydrogel holds promise for\n\n3084 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 14 | NOVEMBER 2019 | 3082–3100 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n regenerative medicine, the formation of a chimeric vasculature of human and mouse vascular cells is\n challenging when studying functional aspects of human-derived vasculature. Transplanted blood\n vessel organoids, described here, form an entire PSC-derived vascular bed that can be used to study\n effects exclusively on a human vasculature. Samuel et al.26 generated functional blood vessels in vivo\n by co-transplanting hPSC-derived endothelial cells with either mouse or hPSC-derived mesenchymal\n progenitor cells. Although the mouse stromal cells supported long-term survival of human endo-\n thelium, hPSC-derived mesenchymal cells could sustain the human endothelial networks for only\n ~28 d, which makes it difﬁcult to study long-term effects on a fully human vasculature. The protocol\n we provide here, leads to a functional vasculature in vivo that is composed of hPSC-derived endo-\n thelial cells and pericytes; we have been monitoring growth in immunocompromised mice for\n >6 months.\n\n\n Applications and limitations of the protocol\n Differentiating hPSCs as described in this protocol recapitulates key steps of blood vessel develop-\n ment. Endothelial differentiation and sprouting into vascular networks, pericyte differentiation and\n recruitment to endothelial tubes, as well as the generation of a common basement membrane, are\n all key events for successful blood vessel growth and homeostasis5 that can be assessed with this\n protocol. For instance, we have used this protocol to investigate diabetic vascular basement mem-\n brane thickening, a hallmark of diabetic vascular complications, in vitro, by culturing blood vessel\n organoids in high-glucose medium containing the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 (ref. 15).\n Blood vessel organoid cultures in 96-well plates also enable reproducible screening of pharma-\n ceuticals. For example, vascular toxicity of small molecules could be tested, and both viability and\n apoptosis of the human endothelial networks and pericytes could be measured by ﬂuorescence\n microscopy or FACS. Furthermore, endothelial cell adherens junctions or endothelial cell–pericyte\n interaction can be analyzed to assess drug potential to induce or block vascular permeability in\n various environmental settings, such as a pro-inﬂammatory state. We have tested a selection of small\n molecules for their capacity to block diabetes-mediated vascular basement membrane thickening and\n found that the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT ((N-[N-(3,5-diﬂuorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)]-S-phenylgly-\n cine t-butyl ester)) greatly inhibits basement membrane expansion15. Blood vessel organoids could\n therefore serve as a platform to validate compounds from high-throughput screening in 2D cell\n culture systems or could be used to complement pre-clinical models. The number of blood vessel\n organoids needed per drug and concentration to obtain consistent results certainly depends on the\n readout of the screen. For readouts at single-vessel resolution (e.g., vascular basement membrane\n thickness15, endothelial cell–pericyte interaction and adherens junction opening) a low number of\n organoids is sufﬁcient (n = 2–5), because one organoid allows the assessment of many individual\n vessel segments. Screening readouts that compare whole organoids (e.g., measurement of ATP\n production) will certainly require a higher number of organoids per condition (n > 5).\n Furthermore, the transplantation of human blood vessel organoids into diabetic mice (strepto-\n zotocin model for type I diabetes) could recapitulate diabetic vascular basement membrane thick-\n ening and vessel regression. Modeling of human diabetic vasculopathy in an in vivo diabetic setting\n in chimeric mice also allows the measurement of functional vessel parameters such as increased\n permeability in diabetic human vessels15. Thus, this protocol is useful in the study of metabolic\n vascular diseases. Furthermore, this humanized mouse model could be used for preclinical toxicology\n testing, because it allows the effects of drugs or antibodies on human blood vessel physiology and\n disease to be investigated in vivo, complementing other preclinical models. Assessment of functional\n parameters, such as vessel permeability or blood ﬂow, in human blood vessels in response to the\n treatment could result in drugs being moved into clinical trials with greater conﬁdence in their\n safety and efﬁcacy.\n Modeling of rare genetic vascular disease using blood vessel organoids is a further possible\n application. Blood vessel organoids could be differentiated from patient-derived iPSCs with\n inherited forms of vascular diseases29. CRISPR–Cas9 could be used to repair mutations and to\n generate isogenic iPSC control lines30. Alternatively, patient-speciﬁc mutations can be knocked into\n well-established and well-performing hPSCs using CRISPR–Cas9 technology. The speciﬁcation of\n blood vessel organoids in vivo into arteries, arterioles and venules could allow the study of vascular\n diseases originating in capillaries and bigger vessels, as well as that of vascular diseases that arise from\n errors in arterial/venous speciﬁcation, for example, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or arter-\n iovenous malformation31. Of note, our protocol appears robust, and we have now successfully\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 14 | NOVEMBER 2019 | 3082–3100 | www.nature.com/nprot 3085\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n generated blood vessel organoids from 13 different human iPSC and embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines,\n making studies with iPSCs from rare disease patients feasible.\n Besides a broad applicability, the protocol will certainly beneﬁt from further improvements in the\n future. Most importantly, perfused blood vessel organoids are currently available only after trans-\n plantation in vivo, but their establishment in vitro would be an important step forward and could\n allow the investigation of functional parameters such as permeability or immune-cell adhesion/\n extravasation under deﬁned and readily manipulated in vitro conditions. A recent study that applied\n ﬂow to poorly vascularized kidney organoids and showed enhanced vascularization and maturation\n of kidney organoids in vitro is promising32. Moreover, blood vessel organoids currently lack inter-\n action with other somatic cell types. Because blood vessels have to fulﬁll speciﬁc functions and\n are phenotypically very different in each organ33, it will be important to generate organotypic\n blood vessel organoids in the future that allow the investigation of organ-speciﬁc vessel diseases.\n Organotypic blood vessel organoids will also be important for possible tissue-regenerative applica-\n tions in the future.\n A further limitation is the use of animal products in this protocol, namely, the extracellular matrix\n (Matrigel and collagen I) and FBS. Those products show batch-to-batch variation of growth factor\n and protein content, which can impact the efﬁciency of the blood vessel organoid differentiation and\n thus negatively inﬂuence consistency between experiments. Beyond the need for batch testing, the use\n of animal products currently prevents the use of blood vessel organoids as a regenerative medicine in\n humans, an issue that needs to be resolved before moving such blood vessel organoids into human\n patients. To achieve good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliance, the following major changes\n must be applied to this protocol: (i) standardization of cell aggregate size (Steps 1–10), e.g., by\n implementing microwell culture plates34; (ii) use of serum-free media, e.g., vessel-supporting media,\n containing exclusively recombinant growth factors and deﬁned supplements35; and (iii) use of\n synthetic matrices for 3D culture36.\n\n\n Experimental design\n We have demonstrated that the protocol is reproducible with three independent hiPSC lines and\n an ESC line (H9)15. Differentiation variability in different hiPSC/hESC lines is a common problem\n with hPSC lines, which may affect the efﬁciency and timing of the protocol. Throughout we describe\n optimization steps that may be required for some hiPSC/hESC lines. In addition, we have slightly\n modiﬁed the ﬁrst steps of our previously published protocol15, and as a consequence it is now 1 week\n shorter and does not require control over oxygen levels. The improved method described here allows\n the generation of hPSC-derived blood vessel organoids over a period of ~16 d.\n Differentiation is achieved through six key steps (Figs. 1 and 2) and starts with the generation of\n cell aggregates in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. The hPSCs should exhibit optimal\n morphology and minimal background differentiation. Furthermore, the successful generation of\n stable aggregates is absolutely critical to achieving an efﬁcient blood vessel differentiation. Therefore,\n the size of the aggregates is crucial and can be inﬂuenced by both the number of cells used and the\n incubation time for aggregate formation. It is possible that both parameters must be optimized for\n each hPSC line used (see ‘Troubleshooting’ section). In this protocol, we use the iPSC line NC8 and\n use 2 × 105 cells per well (of a 6-well plate) for aggregate formation and incubate for 1 d (starting at\n day −1). When we work, for example, with H9 human ESCs, we use 5 × 105 cells per well (of a 6-well\n plate) and incubate for 3 d to obtain proper-size aggregates. Importantly, once stable aggregates with\n a size >50–100 µm in diameter (Fig. 2b) have been formed, the protocol is very robust and can be\n followed as described below without any further modiﬁcations.\n Next, we start to induce mesoderm (day 0 (d0)) by culturing the aggregates in CHIR99021 to\n activate WNT signaling and with BMP-4 for 3 d, before we switch to the vascular induction medium\n containing VEGF-A for 2 d (d3–d5). It is critical to collect the aggregates only by gravitation during\n medium change (d0, d3, d5) and to not apply additional forces by centrifugation. At day 5 (d5), the\n cell aggregates are embedded in a 3D collagen I–Matrigel matrix in 12-well plates. Here, the density of\n embedded aggregates is an important factor that will strongly inﬂuence the differentiation efﬁciency\n of the protocol. Seeding of too many aggregates per well will not provide the space required for the\n sprouting of vascular networks. Furthermore, differentiating aggregates in close proximity will result\n in them merging together into large aggregates, which generally leads to a less efﬁcient differentiation\n process. Very few aggregates, on the other hand, may not be viable and offer only a few vascular\n networks to analyze (Fig. 2e).\n\n3086 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 14 | NOVEMBER 2019 | 3082–3100 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n After 5 d of sprouting (d10), the vascular networks can be assessed for the presence of\n endothelial cells and pericytes and further separated to prepare single blood vessel organoids\n (Fig. 2f–m). Owing to the elastic nature of the collagen I–Matrigel matrix, the whole matrix of one\n well containing 50–60 blood vessel networks can be extracted from the 12-well plate, and vascular\n networks can be liberated under a stereomicroscope, without loss of vascular architecture (Supple-\n mentary Video 1). The singularized networks will self-assemble into round blood vessel organoids\n that can be kept in suspension culture, preferentially in low-attachment 96-well U-bottom plates for\n up to 1 month after generation.\n Once the vascular networks have self-assembled into round blood vessel organoids (Fig. 2l,m), they\n can be transplanted under the kidney capsule of immunocompromised NOD/SCID/IL2Rγnull (NSG)\n mice as previously described for liver organoids37. The human blood vessels stably grow in mice and\n can be identiﬁed by staining with human-speciﬁc antibodies, such as anti-human CD31. Using reporter\n hPSC lines, we showed that in our staining protocol, the anti-human CD31 antibody does indeed only\n react with human endothelial cells15. Moreover, we found that almost all mural cells (>90%), covering\n human endothelium, are also of human origin15. Thus, this protocol generates a fully human\n vasculature that is stable for >6 months and connects to the endogenous mouse circulation. These\n human vessels can be tested for blood vessel perfusion and leakiness, for example, by i.v. injection of a\n human-speciﬁc CD31 antibodies or 70 kDa dextran. At later stages of analysis (~2–3 months after\n transplantation), the formation of arteries, arterioles and venules can be observed15.\n\nMaterials\n Biological materials\n ● hiPSCs: the Procedure we describe is optimized for the hiPSC line NC8, kindly provided by M.

Brieﬂy, dissolve growth factor–reduced Matrigel in DMEM/F12 and use a\n volume containing 1.0 mg of Matrigel to coat an entire 6-well plate (1 mL of Matrigel solution per\n well) for 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. Passage feeder-free hPSCs using 0.5 mM EDTA in sterile\n PBS. After thawing, hPSCs should be passaged at least once before using the cells for this protocol.\n\n Matrigel aliquots for preparing collagen I–Matrigel gels\n Thaw a 10-mL Matrigel vial slowly on ice overnight. Thawed Matrigel should be mixed well and then\n divided into 1-mL aliquots under sterile conditions CRITICAL Matrigel should be kept constantly on\n\n\n c\n ice to avoid solidiﬁcation. Avoid creating air bubbles. Tubes for aliquots should be kept on ice. Store\n Matrigel aliquots at −20 °C for up to 2 years.\n\n 2-Mercaptoethanol dilution (1:100), 10 mL\n Aseptically add 100 µL of 2-mercaptoethanol to 10 mL of sterile PBS. Keep the solution in the dark\n and at 4 °C for up to 1 year ! CAUTION 2-Mercaptoethanol is toxic if swallowed or inhaled and fatal\n upon contact with skin. Use a fume hood and wear protective clothing.\n\n 10× DMEM solution\n Dissolve one vial of DMEM powder in 1,000 mL of deionized water by stirring and heating to 120 °C\n for 10–15 min. Sterile-ﬁlter the solution using a 0.2-µm bottle-top ﬁlter. Store at 4 °C for up to\n 2 years.\n\n Aggregation medium, 50 mL\n Mix 40 mL of KnockOut DMEM/F12, 10 mL of KnockOut Serum Replacement, 0.5 mL of Glutamax,\n 0.5 mL of NEAAs, 35 µL of β-mercaptoethanol dilution and 0.5 mL of penicillin–streptomycin.\n Prepare fresh and store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\n\n N2B27-medium, 50 mL\n Mix 25 mL of DMEM/F12, 25 mL of neurobasal medium, 1 mL of B27 supplement, 0.5 mL of\n N2 supplement, 0.25 mL of Glutamax, 35 µL of β-mercaptoethanol dilution (1:100) and 0.5 mL of\n penicillin–streptomycin. Prepare fresh and store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\n\n StemPro-34 nutrient supplement\n Thaw StemPro-34 nutrient supplement overnight at 4 °C and divide aseptically into 1.3-mL aliquots.\n Store at −20 °C for up to 1 year.\n\n StemPro-34 SFM complete medium, 50 mL\n Mix 50 mL of StemPro-34 SFM medium, a 1.3-mL aliquot of StemPro-34 nutrient supplement, 0.5 mL\n of Glutamax and 0.5 mL of penicillin–streptomycin. Prepare fresh and store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\n\n Collagen I solution (for embedding of cell aggregates)\n To prepare 5 mL of 2.0 mg/mL collagen I solution (enough for one 12-well plate), mix 750 µL of\n 0.1 N NaOH, 313 µL of 10× DMEM, 63 µL of HEPES, 49 µL of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate, 31 µL of\n Glutamax, 460 µL of Ham’s F-12 and 3.33 mL of PureCol. Quickly use pH indicator strips to measure\n the pH of the collagen I solution, which should be ~7.4 CRITICAL To avoid premature poly-\n c\n\n\n merization, pipette PureCol into the solution last. Add PureCol and mix the solution gently. Avoid\n rigorous shaking CRITICAL Always prepare collagen solution fresh at the time of cell aggregate\n c\n\n\n embedding (d5; Step 18).\n\n Collagen I–Matrigel solution (4:1 dilution factor) (for embedding of cell aggregates)\n To prepare 6 mL of collagen I–Matrigel solution (enough for one 12-well plate), thaw Matrigel\n aliquots on ice. Pipette 4.5 mL of collagen I solution (2.0 mg/mL) into a fresh 15-mL Falcon tube and\n\n3090 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 14 | NOVEMBER 2019 | 3082–3100 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n place on ice. Add 1.5 mL of growth factor–reduced Matrigel on ice and mix gently. Keep solution on\n ice until used for the embedding process CRITICAL Always prepare collagen I–Matrigel solution\n\n\n c\n fresh at the time of cell aggregate embedding (d5; Step18).\n\n Blocking buffer\n To make 50 mL of buffer, dissolve 1.5 mL of FBS, 0.5 g of BSA, 250 μL of Triton X-100, 250 μL of\n Tween 20 and 500 µL of 1% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate solution in 47.5 mL of PBS. Sterile-ﬁlter\n blocking buffer using a 0.2-μm ﬁlter and store at 4 °C for up to 2 months.\n\n Sodium deoxycholate solution, 1% (wt/vol)\n To make 100 mL of this solution, dissolve 1 g of sodium deoxycholate in 100 mL of deionized water\n and store at room temperature (22–23 °C) for up to 2 years.\n\n DAPI solution\n To make 1 mL of 1 mg/mL DAPI solution, dissolve 1 mg of DAPI in 1 mL of deionized water.\n Prepare aliquots and store at −20 °C for up to 2 years.\n\n PBS-T solution (0.05%)\n To make 1 L of PBS-T solution, dissolve 0.5 mL of Tween 20 in 1 L of PBS.
