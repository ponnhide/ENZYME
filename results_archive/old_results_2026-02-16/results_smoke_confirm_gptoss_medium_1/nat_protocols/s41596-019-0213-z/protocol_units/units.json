Closely monitor cells under the tissue culture microscope until the cells start to round up.\n3 Dissociate the cells from the plate with a P1000 pipette and pipette the cells gently up and down (2–3×) to break up aggregates and to generate single cells.\n4 Resuspend the cells in 5 mL of aggregation medium using a 5-mL serological pipette and collect the cells in a 15-mL Falcon tube.",
