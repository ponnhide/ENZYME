 Reagent setup
 Maintenance of feeder-free hPSCs
 We maintain feeder-free hPSCs in E8 medium and culture them on Matrigel-coated plates as
 described previously38. Brieﬂy, dissolve growth factor–reduced Matrigel in DMEM/F12 and use a
 volume containing 1.0 mg of Matrigel to coat an entire 6-well plate (1 mL of Matrigel solution per
 well) for 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. Passage feeder-free hPSCs using 0.5 mM EDTA in sterile
 PBS. After thawing, hPSCs should be passaged at least once before using the cells for this protocol.

 Matrigel aliquots for preparing collagen I–Matrigel gels
 Thaw a 10-mL Matrigel vial slowly on ice overnight. Thawed Matrigel should be mixed well and then
 divided into 1-mL aliquots under sterile conditions CRITICAL Matrigel should be kept constantly on


 c
 ice to avoid solidiﬁcation. Avoid creating air bubbles. Tubes for aliquots should be kept on ice. Store
 Matrigel aliquots at −20 °C for up to 2 years.

 2-Mercaptoethanol dilution (1:100), 10 mL
 Aseptically add 100 µL of 2-mercaptoethanol to 10 mL of sterile PBS. Keep the solution in the dark
 and at 4 °C for up to 1 year ! CAUTION 2-Mercaptoethanol is toxic if swallowed or inhaled and fatal
 upon contact with skin. Use a fume hood and wear protective clothing.

 10× DMEM solution
 Dissolve one vial of DMEM powder in 1,000 mL of deionized water by stirring and heating to 120 °C
 for 10–15 min. Sterile-ﬁlter the solution using a 0.2-µm bottle-top ﬁlter. Store at 4 °C for up to
 2 years.

 Aggregation medium, 50 mL
 Mix 40 mL of KnockOut DMEM/F12, 10 mL of KnockOut Serum Replacement, 0.5 mL of Glutamax,
 0.5 mL of NEAAs, 35 µL of β-mercaptoethanol dilution and 0.5 mL of penicillin–streptomycin.
 Prepare fresh and store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.

 N2B27-medium, 50 mL
 Mix 25 mL of DMEM/F12, 25 mL of neurobasal medium, 1 mL of B27 supplement, 0.5 mL of
 N2 supplement, 0.25 mL of Glutamax, 35 µL of β-mercaptoethanol dilution (1:100) and 0.5 mL of
 penicillin–streptomycin. Prepare fresh and store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.

 StemPro-34 nutrient supplement
 Thaw StemPro-34 nutrient supplement overnight at 4 °C and divide aseptically into 1.3-mL aliquots.
 Store at −20 °C for up to 1 year.

 StemPro-34 SFM complete medium, 50 mL
 Mix 50 mL of StemPro-34 SFM medium, a 1.3-mL aliquot of StemPro-34 nutrient supplement, 0.5 mL
 of Glutamax and 0.5 mL of penicillin–streptomycin. Prepare fresh and store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.

 Collagen I solution (for embedding of cell aggregates)
 To prepare 5 mL of 2.0 mg/mL collagen I solution (enough for one 12-well plate), mix 750 µL of
 0.1 N NaOH, 313 µL of 10× DMEM, 63 µL of HEPES, 49 µL of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate, 31 µL of
 Glutamax, 460 µL of Ham’s F-12 and 3.33 mL of PureCol. Quickly use pH indicator strips to measure
 the pH of the collagen I solution, which should be ~7.4 CRITICAL To avoid premature poly-

 merization, pipette PureCol into the solution last. Add PureCol and mix the solution gently. Avoid
 rigorous shaking CRITICAL Always prepare collagen solution fresh at the time of cell aggregate

 embedding (d5; Step 18).

 Collagen I–Matrigel solution (4:1 dilution factor) (for embedding of cell aggregates)
 To prepare 6 mL of collagen I–Matrigel solution (enough for one 12-well plate), thaw Matrigel
 aliquots on ice. Pipette 4.5 mL of collagen I solution (2.0 mg/mL) into a fresh 15-mL Falcon tube and

 Blocking buffer
 To make 50 mL of buffer, dissolve 1.5 mL of FBS, 0.5 g of BSA, 250 μL of Triton X-100, 250 μL of
 Tween 20 and 500 µL of 1% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate solution in 47.5 mL of PBS. Sterile-ﬁlter
 blocking buffer using a 0.2-μm ﬁlter and store at 4 °C for up to 2 months.

 Sodium deoxycholate solution, 1% (wt/vol)
 To make 100 mL of this solution, dissolve 1 g of sodium deoxycholate in 100 mL of deionized water
 and store at room temperature (22–23 °C) for up to 2 years.

 DAPI solution
 To make 1 mL of 1 mg/mL DAPI solution, dissolve 1 mg of DAPI in 1 mL of deionized water.
 Prepare aliquots and store at −20 °C for up to 2 years.

 PBS-T solution (0.05%)
 To make 1 L of PBS-T solution, dissolve 0.5 mL of Tween 20 in 1 L of PBS. Store at room temperature
