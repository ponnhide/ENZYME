Single-cell transcriptome profiling of cerebral organoids at 4 months revealed a large diversity of dorsal and ventral telencephalon cell populations (Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. 6a–j) (14 independent pools of organoids, 3–7 organoids each pool, 65 organoids in total, three independent batches).
