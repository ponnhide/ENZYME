          "note": "An unresolved issue is how the initial, proteostasis-related changes in astroglia contribute to neuronal pathology in C9 ALI-COs. Despite recent evidence of neurotoxicity induced by a similar astroglial phenotype with UPR activation, and the well-described contribution of astrocytes to neuropathology in ALS or ALS/FTD, the functional consequences of C9 ALI-CO astrocytes have yet to be explored. This is pertinent to our organoid model as the transcriptomic data also point to secondary reactive astroglial responses, which can be associated with protective effects. Thus, teasing apart the primary and secondary astrocyte pathology and their functional consequences on neurons through perturbation experiments in C9 ALI-COs would be a therapeutically relevant goal."
