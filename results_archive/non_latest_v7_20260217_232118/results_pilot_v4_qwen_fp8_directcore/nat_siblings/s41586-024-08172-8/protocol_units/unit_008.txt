Snapseed is a scalable auto-annotation strategy, which annotates cells on the basis of a provided hierarchy of cell types and the corresponding cell type markers. It is based on enrichment of marker gene expression in cell clusters (high-resolution clustering is preferred), and data integration is not necessarily required. For all cell type marker genes on a given level in the hierarchy, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) as well as the detection rate across clusters. For each cell type, a score was computed by multiplying the maximum AUROC with the maximum detection rate among its marker genes. Each cluster was then assigned to the cell type with the highest score. This procedure was performed recursively for all levels of the hierarchy.
