 The intestinal epithelium plays a critical role in health and disease, yet the
 impact of microenvironmental cues in diseased contexts, such as inﬂamma-
 tory bowel disease (IBD), remains poorly deﬁned. To address this gap, we ﬁrst
 benchmarked human colonic organoid injury models against IBD tissue and
 established a disease-relevant model of inﬂammation using inﬂammatory
 cytokines. Using this system, we built a dictionary of epithelial responses to 79
 secreted niche factors at single cell resolution via donor-pooled, multiplexed
 single cell RNA-sequencing. The comprehensive nature of our atlas allowed us
 to map relationships between perturbations, infer the function of less char-
 acterized ligands, and identify cell type-speciﬁc perturbed pathways. Finally,
 we established the relevance of organoid-derived gene programs by mapping
 them to single cell and spatial atlases of human IBD tissue. Our resource offers
 a global view of epithelial responses to microenvironmental cues, offering
 insights into epithelial homeostasis and repair mechanisms in IBD.


 The colonic epithelium is a highly regenerative tissue composed of suffer from species-speciﬁc differences8,9, immortalized cell lines or
