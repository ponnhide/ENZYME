The tissue was then resuspended in 25 mL of 2.5 mM EDTA in PBS and placed in an end-over-end rotator at 37 °C until crypts were visible, around 12 min. Following digestion, the EDTA digestion solution was topped up with 20 mL of DMEM++, filtered through sterile gauze, and centrifuged for 3 min at 4 °C, 500 × g.
