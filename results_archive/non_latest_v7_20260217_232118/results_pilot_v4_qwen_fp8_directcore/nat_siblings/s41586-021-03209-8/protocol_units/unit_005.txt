Cortical organoids were cultured using a forebrain-directed differentiation protocol47,58. In brief, two genetically normal human iPS cell lines (H28126 (Gilad Laboratory, University of Chicago) and 1323-4 (Conklin Laboratory, Gladstone Institutes)), which were previously authenticated47, and the embryonic stem cell line H1 (WiCell, authenticated at source), were expanded and dissociated into single cells using accutase. Cells tested negative for mycoplasma. After dissociation, cells were pelleted at 600g in a swinging bucket rotor centrifuge and washed twice in 200 μl CUT&Tag wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Nuclei were isolated by resuspending cell pellets in 200 μl dig-wash buffer (CUT&Tag wash buffer supplemented with 0.05% digitonin and 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630). Nucleus pellets were washed twice in 200 μl dig-wash buffer before resuspension in 100 μl dig-wash buffer supplemented with 2 mM EDTA and a 1:50 dilution of H3K27ac primary antibody (Cell Signaling 8173), and incubated overnight at 4 °C on an overhead rotator. Excess primary antibody was removed by pelleting the nuclei at 600g and washing twice in 200 μl dig-wash buffer. Secondary antibody (Novex A16031) was added at a dilution of 1:50 in 100 μl dig-wash buffer and nuclei were incubated at room temperature for 30 min while rotating. Excess secondary antibody was removed by pelleting the nuclei at 600g and washing twice in 200 μl dig-wash buffer. pA-Tn5 was added at a dilution of 1:100 in 100 μl dig-med buffer (0.05% digitonin, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail), and nuclei were incubated at room temperature for 1 h while rotating. Unbound pA-Tn5 was removed by pelleting the nuclei at 300g and washing twice in 200 μl dig-med buffer. Nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl tagmentation buffer (10 mM MgCl2 in dig-med buffer) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After tagmentation, nuclei were lysed with the addition of 100 μl DNA binding buffer (Zymo Research), and tagmented DNA was purified with a 1.5:1 ratio of AMPure XP beads (Beckman) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified DNA was eluted in 21 μl buffer EB (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) and mixed with 2 μl each 10 μM indexed i5 and i7 primers and 25 μl NEBNext HiFi 2 × PCR Master mix. Libraries were amplified with the cycling conditions: 72 °C for 5 min; 98 °C for 30 s; 12 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s and 63 °C for 30 s; final extension at 72 °C for 1 min and hold at 4 °C. Libraries were purified with a 1:1 ratio of AMPure XP beads and eluted in 15 μl EB.
