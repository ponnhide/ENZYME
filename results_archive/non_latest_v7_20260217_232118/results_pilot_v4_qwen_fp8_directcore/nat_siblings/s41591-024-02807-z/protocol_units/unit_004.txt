Immunostaining confirmed cell proliferation (Ki67) and lack of apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3) within AFOs (Fig. 2f). We confirmed the AFO’s epithelial identity by staining for pan-epithelial markers (EpCAM, E-CAD and pan-cytokeratin) and showing absence of the mesenchymal marker platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα). Notably, AFO’s epithelium is polarized as demonstrated by basolateral integrin β4 (ITGβ4), apical F-actin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1)-positive luminal tight junctions (Fig. 2g).
