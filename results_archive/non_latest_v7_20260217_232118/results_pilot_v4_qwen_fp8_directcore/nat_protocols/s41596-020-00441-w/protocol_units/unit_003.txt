20 Check the conﬂuency of the cells by using an inverted microscope. Cells should have reached
80–90% conﬂuence (Fig. 2b).
CRITICAL STEP It is imperative that the cell conﬂuence is as close to 80–90% as possible. If the
c
cell density is too high or low, this can result in overgrowth of mesoderm, cell death after activin A
treatment and/or incomplete differentiation. Before beginning differentiation, titrate the cell
number for each line to ensure 80–90% conﬂuence on day 0. It is possible to wait an additional 24 h
until this conﬂuency is reached; aspirate the mTeSR1 and add 500 μl of fresh mTeSR1 to each well.
21 Warm an aliquot of day 0 medium to room temperature.
c CRITICAL Pre-warming the medium on this day helps to increase cell survival.
22 Aspirate the mTeSR1 medium. Add 0.5 ml/well of day 0 medium to the 24-well plate. Place the
plate back in the incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.
