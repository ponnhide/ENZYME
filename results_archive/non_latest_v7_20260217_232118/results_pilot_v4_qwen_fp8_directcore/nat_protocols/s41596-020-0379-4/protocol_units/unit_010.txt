Add the required volume of cell-freezing medium, and pipette up and down using a P1000 pipette to properly resuspend the organoids. 500 μl of freezing medium should be used for four ‘original’ wells with organoids of a 24-well cell culture plate. Per sterile cryogenic vial, add 500 µl of freezing medium with the resuspended organoids.
