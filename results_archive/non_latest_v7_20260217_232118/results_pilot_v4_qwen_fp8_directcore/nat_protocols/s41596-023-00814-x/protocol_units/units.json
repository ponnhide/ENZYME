To conduct the protocol, experience in sterile cell culture and\n maintenance of human induced pluripotent stem cells is essential; theoretical knowledge of brain development is\n advantageous. Furthermore, specialized expertise in 3D organoid culture and imaging for the analysis is needed.\n\n\n Introduction\n Pluripotent stem cell-derived 3D human brain organoids serve as a novel type of ‘neural epithelial\n tissue mimetic’ to help dissect the complexity of how neural stem cells self-organize to form the\n human embryonic brain1–7. Besides uncovering the critical events of early brain development, these\n organoids have helped decode cellular diversities, complex interactions, neuronal networks and\n disease modeling of brain development, including microcephaly4,5,8–11. During development, the\n human embryonic nervous system typically emerges from the neural tube. With the inﬂuence of\n speciﬁc and accurate signaling events, the neural tube is ﬁrst segregated into the fore-, mid- and\n hindbrain, and the spinal cord. In vivo, the diencephalon then develops from the forebrain, from\n which the optic cups invaginate laterally. The optic cups will later form the eye12–14. Recent tissue\n engineering studies have elegantly exploited the signaling networks and generated various region-\n speciﬁc brain organoids, including retinal organoids containing photosensitive rods and cones15–22.\n However, although retinal organoids do recapitulate many features of retinal development, they\n cannot model projections of the human visual system, as they lack the downstream targets to which\n retinal ganglionic cell (RGC) axons connect. Indeed, recent work has attempted to dissect whether\n RGC axons can target cortical and thalamic organoids using an experimental system that fused both\n retinal and cortical organoids23. Notably, during brain development, the connectivity of the eye\n primordium with the brain intensiﬁes in a highly coordinated manner. Thus, the formation of\n primitive sensory structures (such as optic cups or vesicles), the development of the visual system and\n\n 1\n Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf, Germany. 2Institute for Neurophysiology, University of\n Cologne, Cologne, Germany. 3Department of Neurosurgery, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany. 4Department of Ophthalmology, Medical\n Faculty, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany. 5Institute of Pathology, University Medicine Göttingen, Georg-August University Göttingen, Göttingen,\n Germany. 6Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. 7Department of Life Sciences and Medical\n Biotechnology University of Siena, Siena, Italy. 8Department of Psychiatry, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA. 9Institut de la\n Vision, Sorbonne Université, INSERM, CNRS, Paris, France. ✉e-mail: jay.gopalakrishnan@hhu.de\n\n NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JUNE 2023 | 1893–1929 | www.nature.com/nprot 1893\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n the organization of various cell types, including the connectivity of axons from RGCs to post-synaptic\n targets in the brain, have not been demonstrated within a single organoid.\n A possible limiting factor is that the optic compartment constitutes both neuronal cell types of\n photosensitive rods and cones, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and non-neuronal cell types of\n lenses and cornea24. Human eye development is a complex process involving interactions between\n neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. The optic vesicle (OV), the primordium of the eye, protrudes\n outward from the diencephalon (caudal part of the forebrain)12–14,25,26. Its position on the rostro\n caudal/dorso-ventral axis of the anterior neural tube is orchestrated by developmental signaling cues\n of BMP, WNT and SHH27. With numerous transcription factors, the OV undergoes extensive\n structural remodeling to form a layered structure named the optic cup27,28. While the outer layer\n includes the RPE, the inner layer comprises a neural retina. Other non-neuronal cell types of corneas\n and lenses originate from the surface ectoderm.\n As a sensory organ, the human eye serves/enables light perception. The light signals received and\n passed through this path are detected by photoreceptors, post-processed by retinal cells, and inte-\n grated by retinal ganglion cells whose axons are connected to the brain. The signal is transmitted via\n the optic chiasm and ultimately to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the visual cortex25.\n Overall, precisely orchestrated signaling networks integrate various diverse cell types that eventually\n build this light processing path. The sensed light is then processed to form images and memories. An\n in vitro experimental system that can deconstruct some of these aspects has not been developed.\n It has been postulated that the formation of the eye results from the inherent property of the OV to\n invaginate29. We, therefore, attempted to mimic human embryogenesis and engineer brain organoids\n that assemble functionally integrated OVs. Here, we describe our protocol, on the basis of seeding\n cells at a low density in a deﬁned but undirected differentiation with a culture medium, to generate\n brain organoids with forebrain entities5. These forebrain organoids constitute dorsal and ventral brain\n progenitors, OVs functionally integrated within the forebrain via axon-like projections. Furthermore,\n the timeline to generate these OV-containing brain (OVB) organoids yielding a wide variety of cell\n types similar to the prenatal eye within 60 days correlates with human embryo development30,31. This\n protocol is versatile as we could generate OVB organoids from ﬁve different induced pluripotent stem\n cell (iPSC) donors. Thus, we hope this protocol offers an easy-to-follow method for experts wishing\n to study the developmental complexity of the human forebrain and brain-associated primitive sen-\n sory structures. In addition, we believe these next-generation brain organoids can help dissect how\n genetic mutations affect the forebrain and primitive eye development within a single organoid.\n\n\n Development of the protocol\n Numerous protocols are available to generate brain organoids from iPSCs1–7. Our group has pre-\n viously described a protocol to induce direct differentiation of iPSCs into the neural epithelium,\n omitting the embryoid body formation4,32. Brain organoids generated via this method have con-\n sistently displayed typical cytoarchitecture containing polarized radial glia, intermediate progenitors\n and ventral/cortical progenitors organized in a spatially restricted manner similar to apico-basally\n polarized ventricular zone (VZ) of the mammalian neocortex cortex4,5,32. Importantly, organoids\n generated with this method did not contain an aberrant distribution of regions such as intermixing of\n neurons in the VZ, which is a critical aspect of microcephaly that primarily arises due to premature\n differentiation of neural progenitor cells located in the VZ33,34. We found the organoids generated via\n this method are robust as we could use them to model microcephaly, neurotropic viral infections and\n glioma invasion assays4,32–34. Furthermore, gene expression studies on brain organoids generated\n with this method showed indications for the presence of retinal cell types.\n On several occasions, these organoids showed pigmented dots placed randomly across the surface\n of the organoids. We also believe that every laboratory has observed the occurrence of pigments in\n their brain organoids. This ﬁnding suggested the presence of a microenvironmental signaling cue\n within brain organoids that allows the simultaneous differentiation of retinal cell types. Indeed,\n several organoids culturing methods use a medium that contains retinoic acid that functions as a\n paracrine inhibitor of the mesenchyme during eye development35–37. Furthermore, altering the\n balance of BMP and TGFβ signaling with respective inhibitors such as dorsomorphin and SB431542\n is sufﬁcient to shift the mesodermal and endodermal signaling cues toward the ectodermal lineages38.\n From these, we also reasoned that retinoic acid or inhibiting BMP signaling from the early stages of\n neuroectoderm differentiation might allow the differentiation of pure neural types, perhaps abol-\n ishing the patterning of the eye ﬁeld and then the generation of retinal cell types. We, therefore,\n\n1894 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JUNE 2023 | 1893–1929 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n titrated the concentrations of retinoic acid and its timing of addition for its ability to induce pig-\n mented dots in our organoids reliably. An addition of 60 nM of retinol acetate around day 7, when\n neuroectoderm expands, reproducibly induced the formation of pigmented regions at around day 30.\n The primordial eye ﬁeld bulges out from the diencephalon as OVs5. Correlating this information\n with our pigmented 30-d-old organoids, we deduced that our protocol-generating brain organoids\n with eye primordium tempted us to develop them further. Upon further culturing, we observed the\n growth of pigmented areas in the organoid. When we dissected the 60-d-old OVB organoid, we found\n a rounded structure inside the pigmented region, which we could later recognize as the lens-like\n structure by immunostaining for αA/αB crystallin. We also isolated the pigmented areas and when\n cultured, we noticed that these were RPE cells.\n Consequently, we were curious whether these OVB organoids are photosensitive, and so we\n performed electroretinogram (ERG) experiments. ERG is a conventional, noninvasive diagnostic test\n to measure the electrical activity of the retina in response to light. Indeed, we detected a response\n when we stimulated OVB organoids with various light intensities5.\n\n\n Overview of the procedure\n The procedure consists of culturing and seeding iPSCs (Stage 0, Steps 1–12), and the differentiation\n (day 0) starts with the formation of neurospheres directly from iPSCs (Stage 1, Steps 13–27). At day 5,\n harvesting and further maturing the neurospheres to primitive organoids (Stage 2, Steps 28–34)\n follows. Finally, the formation of forebrain organoids with a primordial eye ﬁeld (Stage 3, Steps 35–38)\n and, lastly, the generation of OVB organoids with OVs (Stage 4, Steps 39–43) will happen.\n We also provide a protocol for quality checks of human iPSCs by immunoﬂuorescent staining (IF)\n (Box 1), and describe a step-by-step method for immunostaining (Box 2), signal transduction tracing\n experiments (Box 3), isolating and culturing RPEs (Box 4), preparing OVB organoids for single-cell and\n bulk RNA transcriptomics (Boxes 5 and 6), electron microscopy (Box 7) and electroretinography (Box 8).\n\n\n Applications of the method\n To study the human brain and eye development and disease modeling\n Primarily, our method of generating OVB organoids opens new avenues for in vitro studies of the human\n embryonic brain and eye development within a single organoid. The presence of both domains (brain and\n the eye primordium) within a single organoid enables studying the developmentally regulated interorgan\n interactions in unprecedented detail. Examples are analyzing the axonal projections emerging from the\n RGCs into the forebrain region and applying tracers in axonal pathﬁnding.\n Another outstanding advantage of these OVB organoids is that they exhibit immature photo-\n receptors and RPE cells, enabling the study of the visual cycle. For example, for light perception,\n photoreceptors transform 11-cis-retinaldehyde to all-trans-retinaldehyde. This biochemical process\n depends on the adjacent RPE cells, which can recycle all-trans-retinaldehyde and provide\n 11-cis-retinaldehyde to photoreceptors again39,40. As ERG recordings of the photic stress experiment5\n (Box 8, steps 10–15) show the regeneration potential of the retina after photobleaching, the com-\n munication between the immature photoreceptor cells and the RPE cells is already established.\n Therefore, visual cycle-related diseases such as cone–rod dystrophy or Leber congenital amaurosis\n could be modeled with OVB organoids already at this stage. Further maturation of photoreceptors\n would improve the studies of these visual cycle-related diseases.\n OVB organoids are also suitable for studying the pigmentation defects of oculocutaneous albinism.\n This group of genetically inherited congenital early retinal disorders affects ~150 live births every\n year41; thus, there is an urgent need to treat early onset congenital blindness, which is often pro-\n gressive, leading to complete vision loss. Understanding the defective cellular mechanisms that trigger\n disease development in a disease-relevant experimental system is a prerequisite to designing ther-\n apeutic strategies. While pure retinal organoids have immensely helped us understand human reti-\n nogenesis and disorders, they lack in vivo-like OVs containing neuronal and non-neuronal cell types\n and layered RPEs, making them unsuitable for studying retina–forebrain interactions. On the other\n hand, OVB organoids could be helpful since the OVs are the primordium of the eye, the proximal end\n of which is attached to the forebrain. This unique aspect could also greatly beneﬁt dissecting\n developmental disorders that affect both brain and eye primordia, such as coloboma of the eye, heart\n defects, atresia of the choanae, restriction of growth and development, and ear abnormalities\n (CHARGE) syndrome, septo-optic dysplasia, holoprosencephaly and cyclopia due to defects in signal\n segregations.\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JUNE 2023 | 1893–1929 | www.nature.com/nprot 1895\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n Box 1 | IF of human iPSCs for pluripotency ● Timing: ~7 d",

These may include the application of gene delivery such as adeno-associated viral delivery of\n genes, anti-sense oligonucleotides and translational readthrough drugs. Furthermore, when generated\n from clinical patient iPSCs, the patient-speciﬁc OVB organoids could serve as a platform for per-\n sonalized therapy testing.

      "text": "Procedure\n CRITICAL Perform all steps under a clean bench.\n c\n\n\n 1 Clean the micromanipulator with 70% ethanol (eEtOH) and place it under the clean bench.\n 2 Prepare ﬁne glass capillary pipettes (e.g., with DMZ Universal Electrode Puller). Check if the opening is still accessible by sucking and releasing\n DMEM/F12. Prepare at least four thin capillaries for each organoid since they break easily, and each dye requires a fresh, unused capillary.\n 3 Prepare 1:1 (vol/vol) dilutions CTB-488 or CTB-647 in DMEM/F12 in sterile 1.5 ml microtubes and protect them from light.\n 4 Place a 10 µl drop of Matrigel near an edge of a sterile glass slide and let the Matrigel solidify.\n 5 Collect OVB organoids of day 60 and place them on the Matrigel drop on the sterile glass slide. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for\n transferring organoids.\n 6 Remove excess medium carefully. Leave a thin ﬁlm or small drop of liquid around the organoid to ensure it does not dry out.\n 7 Place glass slide with organoids on the stage holder of a stereomicroscope under the clean bench.\n 8 Move the microinjector close to the organoids on the microscope stage holder.\n 9 Fill glass capillary tip with 3 µl of CTB-488 dilution (front ﬁll) and move the needle tip forward in front of the ﬁrst pigmented area. Inject the\n solution into the ﬁrst OV carefully, using a microscope. Try not to injure the OV or the surrounding tissue and avoid making air bubbles.\n10 Move the microinjector tip backward and replace the tip with a new thin glass tip.\n CRITICAL STEP Add one drop of OVB medium on the organoid to prevent it from drying out.\n c\n\n\n 11 Fill glass pipette tip with 3 µl of CTB-647 dilution and repeat step 8 with the second pigmented area.\n12 Transfer the injected organoids into a well of a 24-well plate for suspension culture and expose the plate to normal room light for 10 min.\n 13 After light exposure, culture the plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.\n14 After 24 h incubation, collect CTB-injected OVB organoids in a sterile 1 ml tube. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for transferring organoids.\n15 Carefully remove any carried-over medium with a 200 µl micropipette tip without disturbing the organoids.\n16 Wash organoids once with 1 ml of prewarmed DMEM/F12 for 3 min and remove the DMEM/F12.\n CRITICAL STEP Protect organoids from light in all of the following steps.\n c\n\n\n17 Add 1 ml of 4% PFA, prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath, and incubate the tube at RT for 30–60 min.\n CRITICAL STEP Do not exceed the time of PFA ﬁxation above 1 h because this will lead to high autoﬂuorescence.\n c\n\n\n18 Clear the tissue as described previously10. First, dehydrate the PFA-ﬁxed organoid sequentially in graded EtOH series of 30% (vol/vol) EtOH,\n 50% (vol/vol) EtOH, 75% (vol/vol) EtOH and 100% (vol/vol) EtOH. For each step, gently shake organoids in a 1 ml tube for 30 min at 4 °C,\n always protected from light.\n19 Clear the organoids with ethyl cinnamate (ECI) for 30 min at RT, protected from light. After successful clearing, organoids will display only the\n pigmented areas, and the brain part will be transparent.\n CRITICAL STEP Without tissue clearing, it is impossible to detect clear signals from the ﬂuorescent-tagged CTBs inside the organoid and get\n c\n\n\n satisfying 3D images.\n20 Place organoid in ECI with a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip into coverslip bottom µ-slides protected from light.\n PAUSE POINT Organoids can be stored in the ECI at 4 °C protected from light until 3D imaging. Do not exceed storing for more than\n j\n\n\n 2 weeks including step 22.\n21 Perform additional staining using the blue (405) or the red channel (594), e.g., for DAPI staining (405) and/or IF (594).\n PAUSE POINT Store CTB-injected, tissue cleared and stained organoids for no longer than 2 weeks in total at 4 °C protected from light,\n j\n\n\n since ﬂuorophore signals might fade after this time.\n22 Perform 3D imaging of an OVB organoid using a confocal microscope. We use a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with EC Plan-Neoﬂuor\n 10×/0.3 and Plan-Apochromat 20×/0.8 M27 objectives. Place organoid into the center of the µ-slide chamber and orient the OVB organoid so\n that the pigmented areas are facing to the side of the µ-slide chamber. Start following trajectories from OVs into the inside of the organoid.\n23 Export raw ﬁles to software Imaris x64 version 7.7.1 to perform surface and volume rendering. For details, see the manufacturer´s instructions.\n24 Process obtained ﬁles further using Image J, Adobe photoshop CC 2017, and Adobe Illustrator CC 2017.\n\n\n Box 4 | Isolation of RPEs from OVB organoids and culturing ● Timing ~2 weeks",

However, if you are interested in cell death, cell survival, apoptosis, etc., in your scRNA-seq analysis,\n Rock inhibitor treatment will interfere with the naturally occurring apoptosis pathways and lead to compound-induced aberrant signaling.\n 5 Check after 15 min for dissociation of organoids by shaking the tube and watching the integrity of organoids.

Although some brain organoid\n culturing methods have allowed pigmented areas to form, these mainly were randomly placed or\n scattered across brain organoid surfaces9. This ﬁnding has contributed to the assumption that brain\n organoids are chaotic tissues lacking the self-patterning rules that in vivo systems have43. On\n the other hand, pure retinal organoids assemble pigment-rich OV-like structures protruding from the\n primary tissue. These structures are excised and cultured under a deﬁned condition for several weeks.\n Remarkably, these organoids lack forebrain tissues and do not form in vivo-like OVs, layered RPEs or\n properly positioned photoreceptors16. Thus, so far, no brain organoid culturing method has been\n described to develop bilaterally symmetric optical vesicles or cups. Table 1 compares several different\n methods for generating human optic cup and vesicle-like structures in 3D (including various retinal\n organoids and OVB organoids), detailing which kind of assays/experiments have been used to test\n their characteristics, while Table 2 compares OVB organoids with some of the selected aspects of the\n retinal organoids.\n Below, we summarize the pros and cons of OVB organoids compared with other methods for\n generating organoids containing retina-like structures.\n\n1900 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JUNE 2023 | 1893–1929 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n Box 8 | Preparation of OVB organoids for ERGs ● Timing 2 d",

      "text": "Procedure\n 1 Transfer 60-d-old organoids each to one well of a suspension culture 12-well plate. Add 2 ml of OVB-organoid medium per well.\n 2 Keep the plate in absolute darkness at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h before ERG experiments.\n 3 On the day of the ERG experiment, prepare fresh OVB organoid medium in 50 ml centrifuge tubes. Oxygenate the OVB organoid medium by\n pumping air onto the bottom of the centrifuge tube with a sterile 10 ml serological pipette for 2 min under the clean bench.\n 4 Keep the room where you handle OVB organoids and perform the ERG experiment absolutely dark. Use a red light (e.g., from the western blot\n developing room) as the sole light source. If required, use an opaque box to transport OVB organoids from one dark room to another.\n 5 Set up the ERG aperture and ﬁll the superfusion system with an oxygenated OVB medium81.\n 6 Place organoids under red light in an electrode chamber.\n 7 Place electrode chamber into the dark chamber of the ERG aperture and connect it to the superfusion system containing oxygenated OVB\n medium.\n 8 Set up the speed of superfusion to 0.5 ml/min.\n Dose-dependent light sensitivity\n 9 For dose-dependent light sensitivity, expose each organoid to 500 ms long ﬂashes. Start with a low intensity of 2,000 mlux (moonlight on a\n clear night), increase to 20,000 mlux (candle light) and then to 200,000 mlux (daylight on a cloudy day). Repeat each intensity three times at\n 3 min intervals, and then switch to the next higher light intensity. Record all responses.\n Photic stress experiment\n 10 If OVB organoids show dose-dependent responses to different light stimulation, you can continue with the photic stress experiment. Keep the\n superfusion speed at 0.5 ml/min. Continue immediately after Step 9 with the same organoids. Alternatively, start with new organoids and\n adjust the system by exposing the organoids to 500 ms ﬂashes of 200,000 mlux every 3 min for 15 min (‘pre-bright’ light) until you get a stably\n repeated light response.\n 11 Desensitize the organoid in the electrode chamber by bright light exposure with a light intensity of 4,600 lux for 10 min continuously. A 150 W\n white light bulb could be used as a bright light source.\n 12 Place an infrared ﬁlter between the bulb and electrode chamber to subtract the thermal impact of the bright light source.\n 13 Let the organoids regenerate for 30 s in a dark chamber without light exposure after the 10 min of bright light in Step 11.\n 14 Start light ﬂashes of 500 ms and 200,000 mlux every 3 min and record the responses.\n 15 After 30 min of ﬂashing and recording, using the same organoids under the same conditions to repeat Step 11, but do not use bright light\n exposure, instead replacing it with 0 mlux (darkness). This can be used as a negative control for the bright light exposure procedure.\n Isolation of A-wave\n 16 Set up the superfusion system containing the OVB organoid medium to a higher speed of 2 ml/min.\n 17 Let organoids adjust for 36 min of equilibration time to this higher superfusion speed until they show a stable electrical signal of −200 mV as a\n response to ﬂashes of 200,000 mlux and 500 ms. Record the electric response continuously every 3 min.\n 18 Add 10 mM aspartate to the medium after equilibration time is completed. Record electric response continuously. Aspartate will block the\n signal transduction from photoreceptors to the subsequent retinal cell layers (‘A-wave’).\n 19 Wash out aspartate by adding OVB organoid medium without aspartate into the system. Continuously record the electric signals as responses\n to light ﬂashes.\n\n\n Pros:\n ● A shorter duration of 50–60 d compared with the majority of other protocols, which is more\n\n\n comparable to in vivo development of human embryos and makes it more feasible to conduct\n experiments in a short period\n ● A robust method to reproducibly generate brain organoids with a forebrain entity to model brain\n\n\n development and disorders from a wide variety of iPSC donors (‘Anticipated results’ section)\n ● Closer to an in vivo-like organization\n\n ● Easy handling protocol (no cutting, only four-stage protocol)\n\n ● Easy quality control check for the occurrence of dark dots/RPE\n\n ● Two distinct organ types (brain and eye primordium) in a single organoid\n\n ● Layered RPE cells\n\n ● Immature photoreceptors capped by RPE cells\n\n ● Possibility to isolate RPEs and other cell types of interest and reculture them in 2D\n\n ●\n Generates wide cell diversity of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types (cornea, lens, microglia)\n ●\n OVB organoids harbor the pigmented areas at one pole.

It is noteworthy that even if an iPSC\n line generates neural progenitor cells4,6,32 (as veriﬁed by the expression of Nestin, for example), it\n does not guarantee that the same cell line could generate all other mature cell types of the neuronal\n lineages such as photoreceptors or RPE cells. Testing the standard three germ layers indicates that\n the iPSC line is pluripotent and can form the progenitor cells of each germ layer. This could be a\n likely scenario if one uses a transgenic iPSC line reprogrammed by a lentiviral-based system.\n Lentiviral transduction can introduce transgenes at multiple random sites into the genome. By\n chance, a transgene could be inserted into a coding sequence or a regulatory element critical for\n RPE cells’ development or function. Thus, it is advisable to consider the possibility of random\n integration.\n\n Designing strategies\n Before the researcher starts designing the experiments, certain aspects have to be taken into\n consideration:\n 1 For modeling genetic diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, oculocutaneous\n albinism, and so on, it is necessary to access patient-derived iPSC lines from stem cell biobanks or\n to reprogram patient materials in the laboratory. If no patient iPSCs are available, the disease-\n causing mutation can be introduced in isogenic iPSCs by genetic engineering methods such as\n clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated protein 9 (CRISPR–Cas9)\n technology.\n 2 For developmental studies and live imaging, transgenic iPSC lines with ﬂuorescent reporters, for\n example, under a tissue-speciﬁc promoter such as retinal progenitors or eye ﬁeld, can be used.\n 3 For cell lineage tracing during development, barcoding methods for cells have been described44.\n Before starting the differentiation, this has to be done on the iPSC level in advance.\n\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JUNE 2023 | 1893–1929 | www.nature.com/nprot 1903\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n Control cell lines\n 1 As a control line for patient iPSCs, using iPSCs from at least two different healthy donors of the\n same gender, cell origin and age group is recommended.\n 2 For the CRISPR–Cas9-engineered iPSCs, use the parental cell line used for the CRISPR–Cas9\n (‘isogenic control’).\n 3 For the ectopic expression of a mutant transgene, use the original cell line expressing the wild-type\n gene as a control.\n\n Possible variations in the cell line\n We have generated OVB organoids from ﬁve human iPS cell lines, and the percentage of organoids\n containing one or two pigmented areas changes signiﬁcantly among the different cell lines\n (‘Anticipated results’).\n Several studies report that the cell type from which your selected iPSCs originate might inﬂuence\n the differentiation efﬁciency45,46. We have experienced this ‘somatic memory effect’ when using the\n CRX-iPSC that were reprogrammed from Müller ganglion cells, for which we observed an earlier RPE\n cell occurrence than other lines.\n\n Protocol modiﬁcations\n The protocol we describe here not only allows the study of OV development but can also be utilized\n for studying forebrain development, axis formation, cyclopia, ganglionic eminence, optic stalk or\n optic tract development. However, this protocol could be modiﬁed to obtain organoids emphasizing\n these structures. For example, adding media supplements that support neuronal maturation and\n function (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, BrainPhys\n medium47) to the OVB medium could improve the neuronal activity in the OVB organoids. Notably,\n continued organoid growth beyond 60 d with other neuron-supporting media or inducing vascu-\n latures could enhance the neuronal circuitry and further development of the RGCs, optic tract, LGN\n and visual cortex area.\n\n Statistical requirements\n In all cases, we recommend setting up at least three independent experiments (N = 3 batches) of\n organoid cultures to accomplish statistically meaningful results. For a single batch (N = 1), start from\n the thawing of the iPSC line and proceed with differentiation until the required day of OVB organoid\n protocol. Repeat this procedure twice for batches two and three (N = 3). In each batch, at least three\n individual organoids (n = 3; technical replicates) per timepoint, treatment or condition must be\n analyzed to get statistically meaningful results. For example, to perform four different analyses such\n as IF, western blot, ERGs, and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction\n (qRT–PCR), one should use n = 12 organoids for each test method (n = 12; 3× IF, 3× western blot,\n 3× ERGs and 3× qRT–PCR). The exact number of replicates should be used for respective control\n experiments.\n\n Limitations\n This protocol produces organoids within 50–60 d, which comprise a wide diversity of immature\n neuronal, non-neuronal and retinal cell types, matching Capowski stage 2–3 (ref. 16). However, as the\n protocol described here consumes ~50–60 d across multiple stages, it is prone to the accumulation of\n mistakes. These can further be magniﬁed, eventually leading to an unsuccessful generation of OVB\n organoids. Although we provide a step-by-step protocol, the problems and troubleshooting can be\n frustratingly delayed due to the different steps involved. Furthermore, having tested the method’s\n robustness with ﬁve different iPSC donors, we expect success rates to vary signiﬁcantly among the\n donor lines.\n Even though the described protocol allows the generation of OVB organoids exhibiting a wide\n diversity of various neuronal, non-neuronal and retinal cell types, the nature of cell types is mostly\n immature and matched to Capowski stages 2–3 (ref. 16). This could be because the viability of\n organoids is limited beyond day 60. This poor viability is one of the important limitations, as it does\n not favor the maturation of the cells. As a result, the OVB organoids, at this stage of development, do\n not show mature retinal cell types and retina–cortex connectivity as seen in vivo. We still need to\n attempt to optimize the conditions that allow the generation of healthy organoids beyond 60 d of\n culture. However, the increased accessibility of this protocol may enable researchers to accelerate the\n\n1904 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JUNE 2023 | 1893–1929 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n further development of strategies that can allow culturing them for a longer time. Another limitation\n in this methodology is its scalability to generate many organoids per batch. As most steps strictly\n require manual processing and culturing, there is a limitation on how many organoids one can\n generate per batch. Generation of ~40 OVB organoids per batch is realistic, and this is a sufﬁcient\n number for the analysis of three different timepoints, for example.\n OVB organoids generated with this protocol consistently developed OVs across iPSCs from several\n donors (‘Anticipated results’). We hope further optimizations and ﬁne tuning by a wide range\n of researchers can improve the proposed protocol’s robustness. Finally, due to a substantial portion of\n the brain tissue, the number of retinal and non-neuronal cell types covered for bulk or scRNA\n sequencing (scRNA-seq) is often limited. This poses a risk of using many organoids for sequencing\n purposes, which is not cost-effective. Otherwise, the results of correlating OVB organoids with\n the in vivo counterparts are not satisfactory. However, despite these limitations, we believe that the\n accessibility of the current protocol will develop measures to overcome the limitations described here.\n\nMaterials\n Biological materials\n Cell lines\n ●\n High-quality human iPSCs. We have successfully generated OVB organoids using a variety of genetic\n backgrounds of iPSC origin. In total, we used ﬁve donors (extended details of the cell lines and\n respective publications are given in the key resource table of the main supporting paper5):\n ● IMR90-1 was purchased from WiCell Research Institute, USA; RRID: CVCL_C434\n\n ● Crx-iPS was obtained from the laboratory of Olivier Goureau\n 48\n\n ● F13535.1 was obtained from and generated by the Celeste Karch laboratory\n 49\n\n ● GM25256 was purchased from Allen Cell Collection at Coriell Institute for Medical Research, USA;\n\n\n RRID: CVCL_Y803\n ● F14536.2 was obtained from and generated by the Celeste Karch laboratory\n 49\n !

Patient consent must be obtained before acquiring and working with\n any patient-derived cells. ! CAUTION Human cell work was conducted under the approval by the\n Washington University School of Medicine and the University of California San Francisco Institutional\n Review Board and Ethics Committee (IRB 201104178, 201306108 and 10-03946) regarding lines\n F13535.1 and F14536.2; Crx-iPS in accordance with the French bioethics law. The cell lines IMR90-1\n and GM25256 are freely and publicly available at WiCell or Coriell, respectively. ! CAUTION The cell\n lines used in experiments should be checked regularly to ensure that they are free from mycoplasma\n and other microbial contamination. CRITICAL It is critical to use high-quality iPSC cultures for this\n c\n\n\n protocol. This can substantially affect the differentiation procedure. For example, suppose your iPSC\n culture does not display a typical morphology of homogeneous stem cell colonies but instead contains\n large, ﬂat cells or cells with neurites. In that case, this is a sign of differentiation under stem cell\n conditions. For ‘cleaning up’ in cases where there are up to 20% of differentiated cell areas, remove any\n differentiated cells from the dishes before passaging. If more than 20% of the cells are differentiated, we\n recommend manually picking the ‘good’ iPSC colonies and transferring them to new dishes.\n\n Reagents\n Stem cell culture, medium, differentiation factors and reagents CRITICAL We have listed the\n c\n\n\n components used in the main supporting paper5.
