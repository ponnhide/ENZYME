DAPT (25 mM stock)
Add 462 µL of DMSO to lyophilized stock to make a 25 mM stock solution. Make 50 μL aliquots in
microcentrifuge tubes and store at −20 °C for up to 12 months.

TeSR-E6 Medium (E6)
Thaw a 25 mL 20× Supplement at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Mix the Supplement
thoroughly and add to 475 mL of basal medium. Mix thoroughly again before use and store at
4 °C for up to 2 weeks.

E8 Medium
Thaw the 10 mL E8 Supplement (50×) at room temperature for ~1 h or overnight at 4 °C. Combine
the Supplement with 490 mL of E8 basal medium. Mix thoroughly before use. Store at 4 °C for up
to 2 weeks.

EDTA, 0.5mM
Add 186.1 g of EDTA powder to 800 mL of 1× PBS. Stir vigorously on a magnetic stirrer. Adjust
the pH to 8.0 with NaOH (~20 g of NaOH pellets). Filter sterilize and dilute 1,000× with 1× PBS to
obtain a working concentration of 0.5 mM. Store at room temperature for up to 12 months.

FGF9
Centrifuge the tube of lyophilized FGF9 at 1,000–3,000g for 10 s at room temperature before
opening. Reconstitute to 100 μg/mL using filtered DPBS containing 0.1% (wt/vol) human serum
albumin and aliquot into microcentrifuge tubes. Store at −80 °C for up to 6 months, or at 4 °C for
up to 2 weeks once thawed.

Heparin (1 mg/mL stock)
Reconstitute heparin powder with ultrapure water and filter sterilize using a PES 0.22 µm
syringe-driven filter unit. Aliquot into microcentrifuge tubes and store at 4 °C for up to 2 years.

Hydrocortisone
Add 1 mL of absolute ethanol to 1 mg of hydrocortisone powder. Gently swirl to dissolve. Prepare
small 10 µL aliquots and store at −20 °C for up to 12 months.

iPSCs in culture
Commence the protocol with a minimum of one well of 80% confluent iPSCs (~5–6 ×105 cells),
cultured in E8 medium within a Matrigel-coated six-well plate. The iPSCs can be maintained in
culture with daily refreshing of E8 medium (2 mL per well) and passaging once the cells reach
80% confluency (every 2–3 d) at a 1:6 split ratio for expansion (Fig. 2a), or 1:3 ratio at D2 before
seeding at Step 6 (Fig. 2b).
▲ CRITICAL We have experienced reduced reproducibility of the protocol when hPSCs are
obtained from cultures that have been highly manipulated, poorly maintained, contain high
levels of spontaneous differentiation or have been continuously cultured for long periods of
time (~40 passages and beyond). For optimal results, we suggest performing this protocol with
hPSCs maintained according to Steps 1–9 that have been derived from low passage frozen stocks
to enable seeding for differentiation before the cells have undergone 30 passages (inclusive of
passaging pre- and post-thaw) (Fig. 2a,b). Patches of spontaneous differentiation either outside
or within hPSC colonies (Fig. 2c, top) should be removed via aspiration with a glass pipette and
