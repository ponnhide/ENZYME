          "note": "Rationale for generating organoids from SNRs: During early human embryonic development (18–19 d post-conception), gastrulation forms ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Ectodermal cells form neural plate (20–21 d), neural folds (22–23 d), and neural tube (25–26 d). Neural rosettes (SNRs) form spontaneously from PS cells in vitro during neural differentiation. Hypothesis: Isolated SNRs can generate predictably organized brain organoids with singular neural tube-like structure. Neural rosette-like structures are observed in brain tumors and may affect neuronal differentiation, migration, and maturation."

No Wnt inhibitors are used. FGF2 (10 ng/mL) and EGF (10 ng/mL) are added to stimulate neuroectodermal proliferation and radial glial identity."
