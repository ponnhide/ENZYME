11 Prepare a stock cell suspension at a concentration of 5,000 cells per 100 µL medium by adding an appropriate amount of cells from Step 10 (based on the desired number of HFOs) to E8 + 10 μM Y27632. Gently resuspend the cells.
CRITICAL STEP Seeding an appropriate cell number is critical. For all tested cell lines, 5,000 cells per well resulted in the successful formation of HFOs.
