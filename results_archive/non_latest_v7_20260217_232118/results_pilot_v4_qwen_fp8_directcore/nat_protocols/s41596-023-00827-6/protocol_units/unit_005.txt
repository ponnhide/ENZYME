 2 Dissociate two wells of hPSCs (from a six-well plate, 90–95% conﬂuent, corresponding to 5–7 × 106
 cells; see ‘Reagent setup’) by aspirating the hPSC maintenance medium from the wells, followed by
 adding 1 ml per well Accutase and incubate in a normoxic incubator for 2–3 min.
 3 Verify under a microscope that MEFs have detached from the plate, then aspirate the Accutase.
 4 Neutralize the enzyme by adding 2 ml Stop medium to each well.
 5 Gently ﬂush the cells off the well by pipetting up and down.
 6 Transfer the cell mixture to a 15 ml conical tube.
 7 Pellet the dissociated cells by centrifugation at 400g for 4 min.
 8 Aspirate as much of the supernatant containing enzyme and Stop medium as possible.
 9 Resuspend the cells with 10–12 ml hPSC maintenance medium.
 10 Aspirate the Matrigel-coating solution from the dish (from Step 1).
 11 Plate the cells in the Matrigel-coated dish.
 12 Gently rock the dish with a side-to-side motion a few times to ensure the cells are evenly
 distributed.
 13 Incubate the cells in a normoxic incubator overnight.

 Embryoid body formation/primitive streak induction (d0) ● Timing 12–16 h
 (hands on, 15 min)
 14 On d0, prepare the EB/PS medium as described in ‘Reagent setup’.
 CRITICAL STEP Prepare the medium fresh on the day of use.
 c


 15 Remove the hPSC maintenance medium from the Matrigel-coated dish.
 16 Add 3 ml of cold (4 °C) trypsin/EDTA to the dish.
 17 Incubate the dish for 1–1.5 min in a normoxic incubator.

 21 Transfer the cell mixture to a 15 ml conical tube.
 22 Pellet the dissociated cells by centrifugation at 400g for 4 min.
 23 Aspirate as much of the supernatant containing enzyme and Stop medium as possible.
 24 Resuspend the cells with 12.5 ml EB/PS medium.
 25 Distribute 2 ml per well of the cell mixture to a six-well ultralow-attachment plate.
 26 Gently rock the plate with a side-to-side motion a few times to ensure even distribution of cells and
 avoid aggregation of cells before placing the plate back in an incubator.
 27 Place the ultralow-attachment plate in a hypoxic incubator for 12–16 h to allow EB formation.

 Endoderm induction (d1–4) ● Timing ~3 d (hands on, 20 min)
 28 Prepare the endoderm induction medium as described in ‘Reagent setup’.
 CRITICAL STEP Prepare the medium fresh on the day of use.
 c


 29 After 12–16 h of EB formation, gently collect all EBs from the ultralow-attachment plate to a 15 ml
 conical tube.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 30 After EB collection, add 1 ml per well of the endoderm induction medium to the ultralow-
 attachment plate that previously contained the EBs.
 CRITICAL STEP Endoderm induction medium is added to the empty wells to prevent them from
 c


 drying out, which promotes cellular attachment.
 31 Allow the EBs to settle down for 5 min or centrifuge the conical tube at 130g for 1 min to pellet
 down the EBs.
 32 Aspirate the EB/PS medium.
 33 Gently resuspend the EBs with 6.5 ml endoderm induction medium using a 5 ml serological pipet.
 34 Distribute them 1 ml per well of the EB mixture equally back to the low-attachment plate.
 CRITICAL STEP Only take 1ml of the EB mixture each time. Gently resuspend the EBs each time
 c


 before taking the EB mixture for each well to ensure similar EB numbers are distributed to
 each well.
 35 Rock the plate with a side-to-side motion to ensure that EBs are evenly distributed.
 36 Return the plate to a 5% CO2/5% O2 incubator.

 cytometric analysis of CXCR4 and cKIT expression. Always verify the DE yield is >90% before
 continuing to the anteriorization stage. Different hPSC lines might have different optimal DE
 induction times.
 43 Prepare 25 ml of complete SFD medium as described in the ‘Reagent setup’.
 44 Swirl the plate slowly to make the EBs concentrate in the middle of the wells.
 45 Gently collect half of a single well of EBs (EBs are typically concentrated in the middle of the well)
 to a 15 ml conical tube by a P1000 pipette. Return the plates (containing 5.5 wells of EBs) back to a
 hypoxic incubator until later use.

 66 Low endoderm yield Some hPSC lines do not generated Try multiple lines and use lines that generally yield DE of
 endoderm efﬁciently >90% purity as determined by CXCR4/cKIT/EPCAM
 staining. Alternatively, CXCR4 microbeads can be used
 to enrich the endodermal population on d4. DE cells do
 not survive well after sorting
 Vigorous pipetting during We noticed that pipetting during dissociation of EBs for
 dissociation ﬂow cytometric analysis can lead for loss of CXCR4
 expression
 Suboptimal reagents Critical reagents for DE induction are MEFs used for
 maintenance of hPSCs, N2/B27 and Activin A. These
 need to be batch-tested for DE induction using a line
 that reliably generates DE
 Inadequate hPSC maintenance DE is the most problematic germ layer to generate.
 Verify pluripotency of hPSCs by staining for OCT4 and
 SOX2 (~100% of the cells should be positive). Even if
 the cells express proper pluripotency markers, the
 optimal density matters. We typically plate RUES2 cells
 at a density of 7,000–9,000 cells/cm2 and hiPSCs at
 10,000-15,000 cells/cm2. If excessive cell death is
 observed, 10 μM Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor) to hPSC
 maintenance media for the ﬁrst 24 h following plating
 can be tried. MEFs for hPSC maintenance are plated at a
 density of 17,000–23,000 cells/cm2. However, optimal
 density can vary from batch to batch and needs to be
 tested using DE induction as the end point

 epithelial cells. For examples, see
 Fig. 1b (d15) and Fig. 3b Defective anteriorization or This can be veriﬁed by IF (for illustration, see Fig. 5 and
 ventralization Anticipated Results for description), and by the
 morphology of the cultures at d8–10 (Fig. 9). In addition
 to defective DE, this can be caused by the cell density in
 Step 83. The optimal seeding density for this step is
 7.5 × 105 cells per well (Fig. 9a, left). If the initial cell
 seeding density is lower than 7.5 × 105 cells per well,
 smaller and fewer organoids will be observed on d8.
 These small organoids tend to become hollow spheres
 faster in culture. If the culture is initiated with many
 more than 7.5 × 105 cells per well, organoid formation
 might be less obvious on d8. In this case, the organoids
 can still be resuspended and proceed to Ventralization
 and LBO formation (Fig. 9a, right). These densities may
 have to be adjusted for different hPSCs lines
 Small LBOs at d10 (Step 99) Organoids might be small on d10. If they do not sink to
 the bottom, add 1 ml of fresh media directly to the well
 and wait for two more days before replacing the media
 Exhaustion of the culture media LBOs are highly proliferative between d8 and d20

 branching organoids in Matrigel generation
 Timing of LBO plating in Matrigel The optimal timing to embed organoid is between d20
 and d25. When culturing organoids in suspension for
 too long, they will become hollow spheroids and
 eventually burst and reform smaller cell clumps
 (Fig. 9c). These small cell clumps will not generate
 branching organoids
 Picking of LBOs Although no clear correlation could be found between LBO
 morphology and subsequent quality of Matrigel organoid
 generation, it is best to avoid picking very dense LBOs that
 lack the folding structures, or LBOs with cysts
 Rapid polymerization of Matrigel We suggest embedding organoids one insert at a time
 to avoid Matrigel solidiﬁcation in U-bottom 96-well
 plate before transferring to 24-well inserts
 (Steps 107–112)
 Exhaustion of the culture media With multiple organoids in one insert, more
 ventralization media/branching media can be fed to
 each insert, especially in later-stage organoid cultures


Anticipated results
 Brightﬁeld images of the sequential stages of differentiation are shown in Fig. 1b. Using this dif-
 ferentiation protocol, self-organizing cell clumps will form in 2 d after switching to the ventralization
 medium/branching medium (Fig. 1b, iv). Some of the organoids will detach from the monolayer but
 most of them will remain loosely attached to the plate. The number of organoids formed in each well
 varies from hundreds to thousands. The cell clumps might look damaged right after suspension, but
 they will self-organize/repair themselves the next day. Cell clumps appear homogeneous at the
 beginning and folding structures (Fig. 1b, v) will appear 2–3 d after suspension. Folding structures
 will become more complex with time (Fig. 1b, vi). Budding of organoids happens within 1 week after
 embedding in Matrigel and obvious branching can be observed after 2–3 weeks (Fig. 1b, vii). For-
 mation of self-organizing cell clumps might not be obvious in some iPS lines. However, they will form
 self-organizing cell clumps after suspension and branch out after embedding in Matrigel. These
 organoids can be maintained for more than 6 months and will ﬁll the entire well they are cultured in.
 Organoids can be analyzed using standard approaches, including RT–qPCR (Box 1), IF (Box 1),
 ﬂow cytometry and RNAseq as published20, as well as scRNAseq (Boxes 2 and 3). We use mRNA

 expression predominantly to compare organoids of different genotypes or grown in different con-
 ditions to each other. We prefer to benchmark development by morphology and IF, as published20,28
 rather than mRNA expression by RT–qPCR or bulk RNAseq. mRNA determination typically uses a
 baseline control and reports fold changes compared with this control. In the developmental trajectory
 of the organoids, these would be LBOs or hPSCs. However, the latter do not express mature dif-
 ferentiation markers, leading to large and highly variable fold changes. For example, Fig. 3a shows the
 mRNA fold changes of ABCA3 and surfactant genes when comparing more mature organoids (d170)
 with immature organoids (d15 and d25)20. Since immature organoids do not express or express very
 little mature markers, the fold changes of these markers are high and very variable due to the
 inﬁnitesimally small denominator.
 Examples of IF studies and anticipated results at consecutive stages, using d20 and d60 as
 representative examples, are shown in Fig. 5. During the AFE stage, cells grow in islands containing
 mostly SOX2+ cells, although clusters of cells expressing the hindgut markers CDX2+ are present
 within these islands (Fig. 5a, d8, left). The islands of epithelial cells are interspersed with ZEB1+
 mesenchymal cells (Fig. 5a, d8, right). In the suspension stage at d20, LBOs consist of folding and
 invaginating epithelial cells surrounded by mesenchymal cells (ZEB1+), while large sections of most

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 LBOs express NKX2.1 (Fig. 5b, d20). After development in Matrigel, NKX2.1 and EPCAM are
 expressed in the entire periphery of the organoids from ~d40 on (Fig. 5c), indicating nearly full
 commitment to the lung lineage. We also discovered at this stage (images shown are d60) small
 hollow tubular structures in the dense centers of the organoids that expressed EPCAM but not
 NKX2.1 (Fig. 5c). These cells express FOXA1 indicating that they are endodermal (Fig. 5d). Most
 proliferating cells, as detected by staining for Ki67 are in the periphery (Fig. 5d, inset 1), although rare
 proliferating cells were also observed in the central endodermal tubules (Fig. 5d, inset 2, arrow).
 Surrounding these structures in the center are cells, identiﬁed by the presence of 4′,6-diamidino-
 2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Fig. 5e), that did not stain with any lung or airway markers, or with
 mesenchymal markers (CD90, ZEB1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB) (not shown). However, staining for
 cleaved CASPASE3 (cCASP3) reveals that, whereas apoptotic cells are rare to absent in the tips
 (Fig. 5e, inset 1), the cells in the center outside the tubules were largely apoptotic (Fig. 5e, inset 2).
 These may be remnants of the mesenchymal cells present in the LBOs.
 As scRNAseq is now a standard analysis method, we provide scRNAseq data of 25-, 40-, 60- and
 80-d-old organoids that conﬁrm the IF data, and also provide a more granular view of differentiation.
 This analysis revealed ten clusters (Fig. 7a), with, as expected, a progressive gain of distal lung markers
 and disappearance of mesenchymal and other endodermal markers (Fig. 7b). While many clusters
 could not be assigned to speciﬁc cell types and probably represent transitional states, as is to be
 expected in differentiating, fetal-stage organoids, some clusters could be identiﬁed (Fig. 7c). Cluster 8
 consisted of only proliferating cells. However, we note that Ki67+ cells were also present throughout,
 and their frequency decreased over time. All clusters except cluster 9 expressed FOXA1 (Fig. 7c) and
 EPCAM (not shown), and are therefore endodermal, consistent with our published IF studies. Cluster
 9 are mesenchymal cells whose abundance and proliferation (as evaluated by Ki67 expression) declines
 over time, again consistent with our previously published studies using ﬂow cytometry20. These
 expressed, in addition to classical mesenchymal markers such as THY1, ACTA2, ZEB1 and COL1A2,
 also TBX4 and WNT2B. TBX4 is expressed in pulmonary mesenchyme53, whereas WNT2B is
 expressed in the endoderm surrounding ventral AFE and essential for induction of a pulmonary fate in
 this area52. The mesenchyme is therefore consistent with pulmonary or anterior foregut mesenchyme.
 We identiﬁed mesenchyme expressing these markers previously in RNAseq studies of LBOs20. The
 lung marker NKX2.1 (also known as TTF1) and the lung progenitor marker, CPM24, are ﬁrst only
 observed in clusters 0 and 1, and then progressively spread to the other clusters such that at d80 the
 organoids are entirely NKX2.1+CPM+. The widespread expression of NKX2.1 conﬁrms our IF studies
 (Fig. 5c and ref. 20). Furthermore, at d60 and d80, progressive induction of the distal, predominantly
 AT2-associated markers (NAPSA, SFTPB, SFTA3, LPCAT1, ABCA3) is observed (Fig. 7c). Low levels
 of expression of these markers are already evident in cluster 1 at d40 as well (Fig. 7c). However, no
 SFTPC was detected, consistent with the fact that full AT2 maturation occurs late in the development
 of the organoids and is highly variable20, indicative of slowly progressive development. This is con-
 sistent with the reanalysis of our published RNAseq data in Fig. 3a, where even at d170 expression of
 SFTPC was not present in all organoids, and was lower than that of the other surfactant proteins and
 of ABCA3 (ref. 20). We note that cells in cluster 1 also expressed the club cell marker, SCGB3A2, at d25,
 with expression becoming more diffuse later on. We previously identiﬁed small populations of
 SCGB3A2 in the organoids by IF20. It is possible that the SCGB3A2+ cells are precursors of the recently
 identiﬁed SCGB3A2+ cells in the most distal airways that may function as transitional intermediates
 between AT1 and AT2 cells6–8. Basal cells, deﬁned by expression of p63 and NGFR and mucin-
 producing cells were not detected (not shown). When a merged (as opposed to integrated)62 analysis of
 the data was performed, each timepoint formed a separate major cluster, at least in part due to batch
 effects. Nevertheless, the decrease in endodermal markers and the increase in distal markers with time
 was evident (Fig. 8). scVelo trajectory analysis63 at each timepoint indicated trajectories that ended in
 the population expressing distal lung markers (NAPSA, SFTPB, SFTA3, LPCAT1, ABCA3) (Fig. 8b).
 Taken together, the data show progressive acquisition of a distal lung at the expense of alternative
 endodermal fates and attrition of mesoderm throughout the development of the organoids.
 In alveolospheres, stomach and intestinal markers were identiﬁed by scRNAseq56. Furthermore,
 from our own previous analysis of RNAseq data, a variable and modest match with human intestine
 was observed20. These data suggest that other endodermal cells may be present during directed
 differentiation into lung. We therefore veriﬁed the scRNAseq data from the organoids for such
 markers. Indeed, the small clusters 4 and 5 expressed mid- and hindgut markers, such as CDX2 and
 GATA4 (ref. 64), the expression of which progressively wanes at later stages. However, intestinal and
 stomach markers could not be detected by IF. To verify whether the NKX2.1−FOXA1+ cells in the

 centers of the organoids might expressed other endodermal RNAs but not protein, we punched out
 the centers of the organoids with a 1,000 μl pipette tip and compared the expression of select
 endodermal genes in centers and tips by RT–qPCR (Fig. 6). The centers of the organoids were indeed
 consistently enriched for mRNAs encoding endodermal markers such as CDX2 (midgut and hindgut)
 and PDX1 (pancreas), whereas some other markers, such as MUC13 and GATA4 (stomach) were
 more variably enriched. Small populations of cells with other endodermal potentials may therefore be
 present in the centers of the organoids, at least initially.
