4 Fix the samples in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, wash two times for 5 min in 50 mM glycine to inactivate the PFA, followed by washing in PBS.
5 Permeabilize samples for 10 min in 0.2% PBST (PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100) and block by incubating in PBS containing 5% donkey serum for 1 h, then incubate overnight in primary antibody in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% donkey serum (for primary antibodies and suggested dilutions, see Table 1).
6 The next day, wash the samples three times in PBS and 1% donkey serum and incubate with secondary antibody (1:200) for 1 h at the room temperature (for secondary antibodies, see Table 1). Stain nuclei with DAPI (1:500).
7 Mount sections with Mounting Reagent and coverslip. Slides are ready for the imaging when the mounting reagent dries properly.
