14 On d0, prepare the EB/PS medium as described in ‘Reagent setup’. CRITICAL STEP Prepare the medium fresh on the day of use.
15 Remove the hPSC maintenance medium from the Matrigel-coated dish.
16 Add 3 ml of cold (4 °C) trypsin/EDTA to the dish.
17 Incubate the dish for 1–1.5 min in a normoxic incubator.
18 Aspirate the trypsin/EDTA solution.
19 Neutralize the enzymes by adding 10 ml wash medium.
20 Gently ﬂush the cells off the dish by pipetting up and down using a 10 ml serological pipet.
21 Transfer the cell mixture to a 15 ml conical tube.
22 Pellet the dissociated cells by centrifugation at 400g for 4 min.
23 Aspirate as much of the supernatant containing enzyme and Stop medium as possible.
24 Resuspend the cells with 12.5 ml EB/PS medium.
25 Distribute 2 ml per well of the cell mixture to a six-well ultralow-attachment plate.
26 Gently rock the plate with a side-to-side motion a few times to ensure even distribution of cells and avoid aggregation of cells before placing the plate back in an incubator.
27 Place the ultralow-attachment plate in a hypoxic incubator for 12–16 h to allow EB formation.
