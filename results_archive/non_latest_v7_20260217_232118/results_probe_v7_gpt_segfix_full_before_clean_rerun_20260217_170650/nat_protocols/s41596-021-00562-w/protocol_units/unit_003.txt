25 Centrifuge at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, there should be a noticeable organoid pellet, ~200 µl volume of organoid, depending on the density of the original culture. During centrifugation, prepare the material for the subsequent steps: sterilize a glass dish with PREempt disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol. Add ice to 50–70% capacity of the glass dish, spray with 70% ethanol again and place the dish into the biosafety cabinet. Put Matrigel aliquots into the aluminum cooling block. Spray thoroughly with 70% ethanol, and place it into the glass dish containing the ice.
CRITICAL Ice is not sterile; use with extra caution in the biosafety cabinet.
26 Aspirate CRS using vacuum and a sterile Pasteur pipette. After aspiration, place the conical tube into the glass dish containing ice.
CRITICAL Remove the CRS as much as possible, as remaining CRS could decrease the cell viability and compromise the integrity of the Matrigel matrix.
27 Calculate the volume needed for the desired splitting ratio allowing 50 µl of Matrigel per well (i.e., 1.2 ml Matrigel per 24‑well plate). A typical splitting ratio is 1:3 to 1:5, but this varies and depends on the density of the original culture, length of culture since original thaw, and donor intrinsic growth behavior.
28 Keep the tube on ice, and resuspend the organoid pellet in a maximum of 1 ml of Matrigel. If the total volume required is <1 ml, add the required volume; for example, if 900 µl is needed to achieve the desired splitting ratio, add 900 µl.
CRITICAL Initially, 1 ml is added since a larger volume makes it harder to dissociate the organoids and leads to a more diverse organoid fragment size.
