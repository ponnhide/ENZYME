2 Add 500 µl of the 1× EdU in base medium solution onto the apical side of the monolayer, and 1.5 ml of the 1× EdU in colon monolayer differentiation medium onto the basolateral side of the monolayer.
3 Return monolayers to the incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C), and incubate overnight (16 h).
CRITICAL The incubation time can be increased or decreased depending on the proliferative state of the donor/cells being used, but it needs to be kept consistent across all time points and samples in any given experiment.
4 Once incubation period is complete, remove the medium from both sides of the monolayer, and replace it with ﬁxative solution (4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS−/−), with 500 µl on both the apical and basolateral sides of the monolayer. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.
5 Aspirate the ﬁxative solution, and wash the monolayers at least twice with 3% BSA in DPBS−/− (1 ml on the apical side, 2 ml on the basolateral side of the monolayer).
6 Add 500 µl of the permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton X-100 in DPBS−/−) to both apical and basolateral sides of the monolayer. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min.
7 Prepare the Click-iT reaction cocktail containing 1× Click-iT reaction buffer, CuSO4, Alexa Fluor azide and reaction buffer additive, according to the manufacturer’s procedure.
8 Aspirate permeabilization solution, and wash the monolayers at least twice with 3% BSA in DPBS−/−. Add 500 µl of the Click-iT reaction cocktail to the apical side of the monolayer. Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.
CRITICAL Incubation step must be performed protected from light.
9 Aspirate the Click-iT reaction cocktail, and wash at least twice with 3% BSA in DPBS−/−.
10 If additional staining is desired, follow Steps 106–112 of the main procedure described in the section ‘Sample preparation for immunoﬂuorescent imaging’.
