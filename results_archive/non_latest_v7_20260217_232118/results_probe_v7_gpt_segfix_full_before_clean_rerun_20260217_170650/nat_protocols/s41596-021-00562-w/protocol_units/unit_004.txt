30 Once organoids have been fragmented, add the remaining Matrigel needed (calculated in Step 27) to achieve the desired passaging ratio. Mix the Matrigel–organoid fragment suspension well before proceeding to the next step.
31 Seed 50 µl droplets of the fragment suspension into each well of an Olympus 24‑well, tissue culture treated plate.
CRITICAL It is important to use Olympus 24‑well, tissue culture treated plates as they maintain spherical Matrigel droplets, which are critical for 3D organoid growth. Using Falcon tissue culture treated plates results in the spreading and flattening of the Matrigel droplet. Alternatively, Falcon non‑tissue culture treated plates may be used, but as these do not allow adhesion of the droplets, there is a high risk of the Matrigel droplets dislodging from the well and being aspirated when changing media.
32 Carefully transfer the plate(s) containing Matrigel droplets to the CO2 incubator. Incubate the plates for 15–20 min to allow Matrigel gelation. After 15–20 min, check the Matrigel gelation by tilting the plates. If the Matrigel holds ﬁrm, they should be ready.
33 Place the plate(s) in the biosafety cabinet. Add 600 µl of colon organoid medium to each well by carefully loading into the side of the well to avoid disturbing the Matrigel droplet.
