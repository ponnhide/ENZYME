45 Collect organoids as described in Steps 20–23.
46 After resuspending in CRS, incubate on ice for 45–60 min, or until Matrigel is dissolved. Resuspend the Matrigel via gentle inversion every 10–15 min, and proceed to the next step 15 min before the end of incubation.
CRITICAL Do not exceed 60 min incubation time in CRS as this can decrease cell viability. The trypsin/EDTA used in following steps will degrade most of an...
50 After centrifugation, place the 15 ml conical tube containing the organoids inside the biosafety cabinet, and aspirate the CRS using vacuum and a sterile Pasteur pipette.
CRITICAL While aspirating the CRS, slowly tip the 15 mL tube and avoid placing the Pasteur pipette too close to the organoid pellet.
51 Resuspend the organoid pellet in 1 ml prewarmed trypsin/EDTA via short and quick repeat pipetting. Incubate the organoid pellet in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min.
CRITICAL Avoid completely drawing up the organoid suspension/pellet when adding trypsin/EDTA. Organoids are very ‘sticky’.
