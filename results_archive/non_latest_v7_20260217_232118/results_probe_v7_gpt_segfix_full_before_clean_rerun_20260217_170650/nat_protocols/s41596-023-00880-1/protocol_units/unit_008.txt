72. Retrieve the PFA‑fixed organoids from Step 53 stored in PBS.
73. If the organoids have not yet been removed from the Transwell inserts, prepare a 48‑well plate with 0.5 mL PBS per well.
74. Lift each Transwell insert from the six‑well Transwell plate and use a sharp scalpel blade to cut the Transwell surrounding each organoid in a small square.
75. Using fine‑tipped forceps, grip the edge of the Transwell square and remove it from the surrounding membrane.
76. Place an organoid attached to one of the small squares of Transwell membrane face‑up into a well of PBS within the 48‑well plate.
77. Repeat this for all remaining organoids, then circle the wells to undergo staining via immunofluorescence.
78. Using a P1000 pipette, tilt the 48‑well plate at an angle and aspirate the PBS from the very edge of each well. If the organoids have remained attached to the small square of Transwell membrane, they will not be aspirated by the pipette during staining. However, if the organoids have become detached, we recommend placing the 48‑well plate on a blue background to improve visibility of the organoids and keep the plate flat whilst slowly aspirating the PBS (or subsequent staining solutions) to avoid aspirating the organoid into the tip.
79. Replace the PBS with 200 µL per well of blocking solution and incubate on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 3–5 h.
80. While blocking, prepare the primary and secondary antibody solutions in 0.1% phosphate‑buffered Triton‑X‑100 (PBTX) according to the dilutions listed in Tables 1 and 2, allowing 150 µL per well with an additional 150 µL to account for pipetting error.
81. Following the blocking incubation, aspirate the blocking solution and add 150 µL of primary antibody solution to each well.
82. Incubate the plate overnight (~16 h) on a rocking platform at 4 °C.
83. The following day, aspirate the primary antibody and wash for a minimum of 3 h in three changes of PBS (1 mL volumes), returning to the rocking platform at 4 °C between washes.
84. After the final wash, aspirate the PBS and add 150 µL of secondary antibody solution to each well and cover the plate with layers of aluminium foil or another opaque material to prevent light exposure.
85. Incubate the plate overnight (~16 h) on a rocking platform at 4 °C (preferably in the dark to further prevent light exposure).
86. The following day, aspirate the secondary antibody and wash for a minimum of 3 h in three changes of PBS (1 mL volumes), returning to the rocking platform at 4 °C between washes and keeping it protected from light.
