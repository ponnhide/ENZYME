The PT‑enhanced protocol typically generates 5 × 10^6 cells/well of a 12‑well plate after 13 d of differentiation. The procedure shown here generates 45 organoids, enabling assays for albumin uptake and organic cation transport to be performed, as well as immunofluorescence of PT markers. For the generation of 45 organoids of 250,000 cells each, 11.25 × 10^6 cells are required. Therefore, we recommend preparing four Laminin‑521‑coated wells for hPSC differentiation (minimum three wells).\n11. Aspirate E8 from hPSCs, wash well with 1 mL of room temperature TrypLE Select, then aspirate and replace with a fresh 1 mL of TrypLE Select.\n12.
