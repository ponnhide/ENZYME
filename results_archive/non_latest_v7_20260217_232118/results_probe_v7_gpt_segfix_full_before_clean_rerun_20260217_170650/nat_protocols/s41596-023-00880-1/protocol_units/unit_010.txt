10. Day −1: prepare a Laminin‑521‑coated 12‑well plate before passaging and warm to 37 °C in the CO2 incubator (see ‘Reagent setup’). Determine the number of wells to be seeded according to the number of organoids required. The PT‑enhanced protocol typically generates 5 × 10^6 cells/well of a 12‑well plate after 13 d of differentiation. The procedure shown here generates 45 organoids, enabling assays for albumin uptake and organic cation transport to be performed, as well as immunofluorescence of PT markers. For the generation of 45 organoids of 250,000 cells each, 11.25 × 10^6 cells are required. Therefore, we recommend preparing four Laminin‑521‑coated wells for hPSC differentiation (minimum three wells).
11. Aspirate E8 from hPSCs, wash well with 1 mL of room temperature TrypLE Select, then aspirate and replace with a fresh 1 mL of TrypLE Select.
12. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 3 min, monitoring for rounding of the cells (Step 3).
13. While incubating, dispense 3 mL of room temperature E8 into a 15 mL conical tube.
14. Following incubation, use a P1000 pipette to gently pipette the cells up and down three times to dissociate them into small clusters.
15. Transfer the suspension of small cell clusters to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, invert three or four times to evenly distribute cells and immediately remove 10 µL for cell counting using a hemocytometer.
16. After determining cell density, prepare a cell seeding mastermix in a conical tube according to the number of Laminin‑521‑coated wells to be seeded for differentiation, allowing for 25,000 cells/well and 1 mL/well medium volume (plus one additional well for pipetting error).
