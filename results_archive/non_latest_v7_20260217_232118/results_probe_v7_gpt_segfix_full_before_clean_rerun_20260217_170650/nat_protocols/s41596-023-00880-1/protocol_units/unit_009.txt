87. After the final wash, working one well at a time to prevent the organoids drying, aspirate the PBS from the well and use fine‑tipped forceps to grip the edge of the small square of Transwell membrane with attached organoid. If an organoid has detached from the membrane and folded during the staining process, do not attempt to unfold the organoid with a pipette tip or forceps. Instead, gently agitate the well in a low volume of PBS or add drops of PBS directly on top of the organoid from above the well to encourage unfolding. Once the organoid is flat, slowly aspirate the remaining PBS from the well, while keeping the organoid suspended above the square of Transwell membrane from which it detached.
88. Lift each membrane with attached organoid out of the wells and place face‑down on a glass‑bottomed imaging dish. Add a small drop (~20 µL) of glycerol to just cover the organoid.
89. Image using a confocal microscope with 405, 488, 594 and 640 nm lasers to identify PT‑specific markers within nephrons stained with EPCAM (Fig. 4a,b).
