29. Day 13: on day 13 of monolayer differentiation, label the required number of six-well Transwell plates for organoid generation. If performing PT functionality assays and immunofluorescence outlined below, 2.5 Transwell plates will be required.
30. Aspirate the CDBLY2 medium from each well of differentiated hPSC, wash with 1 mL/well of room temperature TrypLE Select, then aspirate and replace with a fresh 1 mL of TrypLE Select.
31. Incubate plate at 37 °C for 3 min.
32. While the cells are incubating, place 1 mL of room temperature E6 containing 2% FBS into a 15 mL conical tube (one tube for every three or four wells of a 12-well plate).
33. Gently detach the cells from the well surface by pipetting up and down a maximum of six times using a P1000 pipette, dissociating to a single‑cell suspension.
