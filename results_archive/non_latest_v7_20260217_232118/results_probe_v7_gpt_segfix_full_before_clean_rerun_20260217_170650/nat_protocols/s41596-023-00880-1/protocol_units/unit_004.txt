47. Culture the organoids for 5 d (to day 18), replacing the E6/FGF9/heparin medium once on day 3 post‑organoid generation (day 16).
48. Day 18: on day 5 post‑organoid generation (day 18), change the culture medium to E6 (without FGF9 or heparin).
49. Culture the organoids for a further 9 d after FGF9/heparin removal, refreshing the E6 medium every second day, to day 27 (equivalent to D13 + 14 in the original related research6).
