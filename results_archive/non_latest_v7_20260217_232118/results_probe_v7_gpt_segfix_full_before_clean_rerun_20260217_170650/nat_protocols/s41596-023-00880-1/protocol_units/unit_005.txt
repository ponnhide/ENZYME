51. For fixation, aspirate medium from the base of the transwell and replace with 1 mL per well of cold 4% PFA, also adding one drop of PFA on top of each organoid. Incubate the plate for 30 min at 4 °C, then remove PFA using a P1000 pipette and discard in the appropriate PFA waste container. Wash three times with PBS, 10 min per wash in the same manner as fixation, adding 1 mL of PBS to the basolateral Transwell compartment and one drop on top of each organoid.
After the final wash, add 1 mL of sterile PBS to the Transwell basolateral compartment and seal the plate with parafilm for short‑term storage. For longer‑term storage, proceed to Steps 73–77 and store the 48‑well plate of organoids sealed with parafilm at 4 °C for up to 1 year.
