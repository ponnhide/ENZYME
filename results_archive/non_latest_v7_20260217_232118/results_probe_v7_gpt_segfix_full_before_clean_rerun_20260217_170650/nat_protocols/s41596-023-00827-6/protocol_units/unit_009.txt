90 On d6, 24 h (± 2 h) after adding the Anteriorization medium-2, prepare an appropriate amount of the ventralization medium/branching medium (2 ml per well) as described in ‘Reagent setup’.
CRITICAL STEP Prepare the medium fresh on the day of use.
91 Replace the Anteriorization medium-2 with ventralization medium/branching medium (2 ml per well).
92 Return the plates to a normoxic incubator.
93 On d8, 48 h later, prepare an appropriate amount of the ventralization medium/branching medium (2 ml per well) as described in ‘Reagent setup’.
94 Aspirate all the old ventralization medium/branching medium and add 2 ml fresh ventralization medium/branching medium to each well.
95 Suspend the organoids by gently pipetting up and down with P1000 tips.
96 Transfer the suspended organoids to six-well ultralow-attachment plates (one well to one well).
97 Rock the plate with a side-to-side motion to ensure that cells are evenly distributed.
98 Return the plate to a normoxic incubator.
99 On d10, feed the organoids by tilting the plate and allowing the organoids to sink to the bottom edge. Remove the old medium while avoiding touching the organoids. Add 2 ml freshly prepared ventralization medium/branching medium to each well. Feed the organoids with freshly prepared medium on the day of use every other day.
