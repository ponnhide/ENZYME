5 Add 400 μl Direct-zol RNA PreWash to the column and centrifuge. Discard the ﬂow through and repeat this step.
6 Add 700 μl RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 1 min to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Transfer the column carefully into an RNase-free tube.
7 To elute RNA, add 15 μl of DNase-/RNase-free water directly to the column matrix and centrifuge.
