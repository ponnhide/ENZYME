8 Aspirate the wash medium and cell recovery reagent and add 1 ml of Accutase to the organoid and incubate at 37 °C.
CRITICAL STEP Avoid using trypsin to dissociate the organoid as it is too harsh and the chances of losing fragile cell types is higher.
9 Gently shake the tube to disturb/dissociate the organoid every 5 min and replace the tube at 37 °C for 10–12 min. Time varies depending on the organoid size and density.
10 When the organoid is dissociated add 10 ml wash medium and centrifuge at 400g for 4 min.
