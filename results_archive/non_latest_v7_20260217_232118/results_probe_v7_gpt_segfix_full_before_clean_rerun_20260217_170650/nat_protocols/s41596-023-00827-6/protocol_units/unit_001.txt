1 Aspirate the medium from the insert with lung organoid and add 300 μl of Trizol to the insert using a P1000. Pipette up and down several times to break the Matrigel and collect the content of the insert. Transfer the organoid in trizol into a 1.5 ml tube and vortex until homogenized.
2 Centrifuge the sample at 16,000g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the residual Matrigel. Take the supernatant and mix with equal amount of 100% ethanol and vortex thoroughly.
3 Transfer the mixture into a Zymo-Spin IC Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30 s at 16,000g. Transfer the column into a new collection tube and discard the ﬂow through.
