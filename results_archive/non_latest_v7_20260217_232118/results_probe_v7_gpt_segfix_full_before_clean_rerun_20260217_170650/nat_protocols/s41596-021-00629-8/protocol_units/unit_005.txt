Two days after seeding (d-2), the hPSC aggregates are embedded in Matrigel droplets. Before you start, take out the required amount of Matrigel aliquots from the freezer and let them thaw on ice. When the Matrigel is thawed, insert the aliquots into the ice. Take out the sterile scissors (heated to at least 180 °C for at least 3 h), and let them cool down at room temperature. ... Afterward, place the plate into the incubator for 50–60 min to let the Matrigel solidify. Add 100 µL E8 per well. A multichannel pipet can be used in this step. Add the medium slowly and carefully, depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the first stop to prevent damage and floating of the Matrigel droplets. Place the plate back into the incubator.
