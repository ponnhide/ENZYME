Seed 100 µL of the stock cell suspension per well of a U-shaped ultra-low attachment 96-well plate. Seed 12 wells (one row) more than the number of desired HFOs (Table 1). Centrifuge the plate at 300g and 4 °C for 3 min to bring the cells to the culture plate bottom, and place the plate into the incubator.
