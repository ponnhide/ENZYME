Obtain a six-well plate of high-quality hPSCs grown on MEFs (~80% conﬂuency) in standard hPSC culture medium containing 20% KnockOut Serum Replacement (Fig. 3a). Aspirate the medium and wash with 3 mL of PBS w/o. Add 500 μL of Accutase, and place the plate into a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C for 3 min. Add 3 mL of DMEM/F12, and disperse the colonies into single cells by pipetting until all cells are detached. Transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube, and centrifuge at 300g for 3 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant, and gently resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of E8 + 10 μM Y27632. Take a prepared Geltrex-coated T25 ﬂask, aspirate the medium and add 4 mL E8 + 10 μM Y27632. Transfer the cell suspension from step (v) to the T25 ﬂask, and place the ﬂask into the incubator. Move the ﬂask a few times back and forth and left to right at the point where it is placed in the incubator to ensure that the cells are equally distributed (Supplementary Video 1). Change the medium after 2 d and then daily by aspirating the medium and adding 5 mL of fresh E8. When the cells are conﬂuent, proceed to the next step.
