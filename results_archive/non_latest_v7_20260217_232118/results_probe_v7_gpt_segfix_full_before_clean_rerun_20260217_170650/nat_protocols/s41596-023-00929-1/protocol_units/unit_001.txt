1. Turn on rotating oven and allow it to heat up to 37 °C while you prepare your sample.
2. Obtain a 60 mm cell culture dish containing ~7 mL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.
3. Add 150 µL of pre-aliquoted DNase (10 mg/mL) to each dish.
4. Obtain ~250 mg of human brain tissue per sample. Document case details.
▲ Caution Local institutional guidelines should always be followed when using human source materials since they can contain blood-borne pathogens. These protocols probably will include training, proper engineering and personal barrier protections.
5. Place in dish containing HBSS/BSA/glucose + DNase.
▲ Critical step It is crucial DNase is added to the solution at this step otherwise digestion will be inadequate. See also the troubleshooting advice for Steps 9 and 54.
6. With a scalpel, cut tissue into small (~2 mm × 2 mm chunks) in HBSS/BSA/glucose + DNase solution in a sterile environment (Fig. 2).
▲ Critical step Ideally, dissection should occur in a cell culture biosafety cabinet. If this is not possible, the tissue can be dissected outside of a hood with attention paid to best aseptic technique.
7. Distribute tissue into three 15 mL conical tubes.
 • Aliquot the tissue–buffer solution in the dish into the tubes first
 • Use extra HBSS/BSA/glucose buffer to wash the dish and make up to 5 mL per tube
8. Add 167 µL of collagenase/dispase (100 mg/mL) to each tube. Please note, 167 µL of collagenase/dispase per 5 mL is equivalent to 33.4 µL of solution per 1 mL.
9. Digest for 30 min in rotating oven at 37 °C.
▲ Critical step Optimal enzymatic digestion is the most important factor to maximize yield. Therefore, this step may need optimizing to achieve sufficient but not too much digestion. See also the troubleshooting advice for Step 54.
