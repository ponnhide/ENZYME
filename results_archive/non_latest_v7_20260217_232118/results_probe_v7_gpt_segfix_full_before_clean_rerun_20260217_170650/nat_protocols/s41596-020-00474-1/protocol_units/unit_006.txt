33 Centrifuge the cells and aspirate the medium as described in Step 30.
PAUSE POINT At this point, cells can be frozen with Recovery Cell Freezing Medium by adding 1 ml, resuspending the cell pellet and transferring to a cryovial. Preserving part of the isolation yield will ensure a backup of the sample in case the culture is lost at an early passage before cryopreservation (e.g., due to bacterial or fungal contamination or improper handling by an inexperienced user).
34 Resuspend the pellet in an appropriate amount of BME. As a guideline, 200 µl is sufficient for a pellet of ~50 µl. The amount of BME to add scales linearly with the pellet volume.
