27 Centrifuge the ﬂow-through from Steps 22–26 at 450g for 5 min at 8 °C.
28 Aspirate the supernatant, leaving the last 4 ml to avoid disturbing the pellet. Resuspend the tissue pellet in the remaining 4 ml with a sterile serological pipette and transfer it to a 15-ml Falcon tube pre-wetted with D-BSA.
29 Add 10 ml of D-BSA with a sterile serological pipette and homogenize by pipetting up and down several times.
30 Centrifuge the 15-ml Falcon tube at 450g for 5 min at 8 °C. Aspirate the supernatant very carefully with a vacuum system and clean tip until 1 ml is left. Let the tube rest for 1 min to allow the D-BSA from the side of the tube to settle at the bottom and remove the residual D-BSA with a P1000 pipette.
31 (Optional) If the pellet is partially red, add 1–2 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer with a P1000 pipette, resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down several times and incubate for 2 min at RT before continuing with Step 32.
