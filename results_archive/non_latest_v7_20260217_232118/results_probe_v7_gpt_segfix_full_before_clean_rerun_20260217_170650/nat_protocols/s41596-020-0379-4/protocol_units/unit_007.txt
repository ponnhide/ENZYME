7 When the mixture becomes cloudy and the remaining tissue fragments are disrupted, further aid tissue disruption by pipetting up and down 10–20 times using a P1000 pipette. Wash once by topping up with 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium, and centrifuge at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C. 8 Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium, and ﬁlter using a 100-µm cell strainer. 9 Centrifuge the resuspended and ﬁltered cells at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C.
