14 Once the BME drops are solidiﬁed (30–60 min), ﬂip the plate and carefully add 500 µl of organoid medium to each well. 15 Place the culture plate in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2. 16 Change the medium every 2–3 d by carefully aspirating medium from the wells and replacing it with fresh, pre‑warmed medium. Keep ROCK inhibitor and Primocin (in the case of head and neck organoids, also caspofungin) in the culture medium for the ﬁrst two passages of the culture.
