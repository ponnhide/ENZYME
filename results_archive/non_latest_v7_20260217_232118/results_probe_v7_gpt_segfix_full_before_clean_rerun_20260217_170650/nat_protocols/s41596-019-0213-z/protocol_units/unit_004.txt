26 Pipette the aggregates into 15‑mL tubes with a 10‑mL serological pipette. Collect aggregates by gravitation.
27 Wash the aggregates by aspirating the supernatant and adding 1 mL of StemPro‑34 SFM complete medium. Repeat the wash once.
28 Use a P200 pipette to aspirate the medium; remove all remaining medium carefully.
29 For the second layer, add PureCol to prepare complete collagen I solution.
30 Prepare the collagen I–Matrigel solution and keep on ice.
31 Resuspend the aggregates in collagen I–Matrigel solution and keep on ice.
32 Remove the 12‑well plate containing the ﬁrst layer of collagen I–Matrigel from the incubator and carefully add 0.5 mL of cell aggregate–collagen I–Matrigel solution to each well of the 12‑well plate.
33 Distribute the aggregates in the wells by rocking the plate back and forth. Once the aggregates are well distributed, slowly move the plate to the incubator.
34 Incubate the 12‑well plate for 2 h at 37 °C for gel solidiﬁcation.
35 Add prewarmed (37 °C) StemPro‑34 SFM complete medium including 15 % FBS, 100 ng/mL VEGF‑A and 100 ng/mL FGF‑2 to induce blood vessel differentiation. Sprouting vessels should appear after 1–3 d after embedding.
