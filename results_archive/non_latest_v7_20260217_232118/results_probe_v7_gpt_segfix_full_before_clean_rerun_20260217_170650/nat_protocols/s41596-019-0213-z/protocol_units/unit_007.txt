40 Remove the blocking buffer and add 50–100 µL of primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (Table 1). Incubate vessel networks/organoids in an upright position on a rocking shaker at 4 °C overnight. For sections, incubate in a wet chamber at 4 °C overnight.
41 On the next day, wash the samples three times for 10–15 min in PBS‑T solution. For vessel networks/organoids, place the tube rack vertically on an orbital shaker for washing.
42 Add secondary fluorescent antibody (Table 1) in blocking buffer and incubate for 2 h at room temperature.
43 Wash the samples two times for 10–15 min in PBS‑T solution.
44 Add DAPI solution (1:1,000 in PBS) and incubate for 10–15 min.
45 Wash samples in PBS for 10–15 min.
