Differentiation of PSCs into anterior/posterior gut cells (days 3–6) ● Timing 0.5–1 h
every day
30 (Optional) If anterior or posterior gut cells cannot be differentiated successfully, conﬁrm that PSCs
are induced to deﬁnite endoderm on day 3 by immunostaining5. Endoderm markers, such as
GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), SRY-Box transcription factor 17 (SOX17) and Forkhead box
A2 (FOXA2), can be used to determine the efﬁciency of the deﬁnite endoderm differentiation.
Over 70% of cells should express these markers. An example of optimal results is shown in Fig. 2c.
31 Each day on days 3–6, warm anterior day 3–6 medium and posterior day 3–6 medium at room
temperature and then aspirate the media and replace with 500 μl/well of the prewarmed anterior
day 3–6 medium (for anterior gut cells) and prewarmed posterior day 3–6 medium (for posterior
gut cells). Owing to the high number of live cells in each well, the phenol red in the medium will
turn yellow by 24 h. Conﬁrm the presence of 3D structures forming from the monolayer of cells,
including attached and ﬂoating spheroids (Fig. 2d–f).
32 (Optional) If anterior or posterior gut spheroids cannot be formed successfully, conﬁrm that PSCs
are induced to anterior/posterior gut cells by ﬂow cytometry analysis. The epithelial marker
EpCAM can be used to determine the efﬁciency of the gut differentiation. 60–90% of cells in both
the anterior and posterior structures should express EpCAM on day 7. An example of optimal
results is shown in Fig. 2g.
