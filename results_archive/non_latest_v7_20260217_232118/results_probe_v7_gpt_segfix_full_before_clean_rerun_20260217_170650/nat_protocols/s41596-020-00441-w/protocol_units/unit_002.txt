Change mTeSR medium (day −1) ● Timing 0.5 h
16 Warm mTeSR1 at room temperature (15–25 °C).
17 Conﬁrm that the plated cells are healthy and are growing at a uniformly high density.
18 Aspirate old mTeSR1 with 10 μM Y-27632 to change the medium. Add fresh mTeSR1 without
Y-27632 (Step 16), 500 μl/well for a 24-well plate.
19 Place the 24-well plate back in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.
