Anterior/posterior gut spheroid formation (day 7) ● Timing 2–3 h
33 On day 7, dissociate the anterior or posterior gut cells to single cells by incubation with TrypLE
Express at 37 °C for 5 min (Fig. 3a).
34 Add 500 μl of warm DMEM/F12 to each well to sufﬁciently dilute the TrypLE.
35 Centrifuge the cells at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min and, after removing the supernatant, resuspend the
pellet in day 7 medium.
36 Plate the anterior or posterior gut cell suspensions in 96-well round-bottom ultra-low
attachment plates at a density of 10,000 cells with 100 µl day 7 medium per well and
incubate at 37 °C overnight to form spheroids. Prepare the same number of anterior and posterior
spheroids.
