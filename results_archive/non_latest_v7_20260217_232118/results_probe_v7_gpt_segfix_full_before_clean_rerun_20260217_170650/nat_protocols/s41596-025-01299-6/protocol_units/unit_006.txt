Days 3–6: neural induction
● TIMING 4 d, ~0.5–3 h per d
25. From day 3 to day 6, perform medium change daily. Carefully remove the medium by using
 a 10-ml serological pipette and replace it with 10 ml of E6 medium supplemented with
 dorsomorphin (2.5 μM), SB-431542 (10 μM) and XAV-939 (1.25 μM).
▲ CRITICAL STEP If the organoids fuse to each other, pipette the clusters of organoids
 up and down a few times gently with a 10-ml serological pipette to separate them. If some
 fusions cannot be separated through pipetting, it is fine to leave them as is. Minimize the
 time that the cultures are kept outside of the incubator at all stages of the differentiation.
