Incubate the plate at 37 °C. Begin monitoring cell detachment under a microscope after 5 min of incubation. Some lines may already be detached after 5 min; most require 15–20 min. Once the sheet of cells is detached, carefully transfer it into a 15 mL conical tube using a 5 mL serological pipet.\n28. Let the cell clump settle to the bottom of the tube by gravity (1–2 min). Then, carefully remove the supernatant using a 1 mL pipet to avoid disturbing the clump.\n29. Wash it three times using 3 mL N2/B27 medium. During each washing step, dislodge the clump from the bottom of the tube with medium while carefully avoiding breaking it into pieces. Let it settle to the bottom of the tube after each wash.\n30.

Check the size under the microscope.\n31. Replate the resultant clumps of cell at low density to promote NR formation. We usually replate one well into three or four 35 mm dishes. To replate into three dishes, transfer all cell clumps into a 15 mL conical tube and adjust the total volume with amplification medium to 12 mL.

Using the rubber end of a 3 mL syringe plunger, apply pressure to the parafilm directly above a hole to form a dimple to be filled with MG.
