26. For passaging one well, aliquot and warm 10 mL N2/B27 medium (for washing), 1 mL dispase (for dissociation) and 12 mL of amplification medium without EGF and FGF2 for replating. Add 10 ng/mL FGF2 (1:10,000) and 10 ng/mL EGF (1:10,000) to warm amplification medium just before use.
27. Aspirate neural induction medium and add 1 mL dispase per well. Incubate the plate at 37 °C. Begin monitoring cell detachment under a microscope after 5 min of incubation. Some lines may already be detached after 5 min; most require 15–20 min. Once the sheet of cells is detached, carefully transfer it into a 15 mL conical tube using a 5 mL serological pipet.
28. Let the cell clump settle to the bottom of the tube by gravity (1–2 min). Then, carefully remove the supernatant using a 1 mL pipet to avoid disturbing the clump.
29. Wash it three times using 3 mL N2/B27 medium. During each washing step, dislodge the clump from the bottom of the tube with medium while carefully avoiding breaking it into pieces. Let it settle to the bottom of the tube after each wash.
30. After the last wash, add 4 mL amplification medium and gently triturate (~5 times) the clump of cells using a 5 mL pipette to break it into small clumps of cells that are ~750 μm by 750 μm in size. Check the size under the microscope.
31. Replate the resultant clumps of cell at low density to promote NR formation. We usually replate one well into three or four 35 mm dishes. To replate into three dishes, transfer all cell clumps into a 15 mL conical tube and adjust the total volume with amplification medium to 12 mL. If replating four dishes, scale the total volume to 16 mL. Then, split the total volume between three MG‑coated dishes.
32. Place the dishes with cell clusters in an incubator and move them back‑and‑forth and side‑to‑side to evenly distribute clusters over the entire surface.
33. Change the medium every other day (two medium changes total, on days 2 and 4 post‑replating) by aspirating ~50% of the old medium and adding 2 mL of fresh amplification medium with 2× concentrations of FGF2 and EGF to achieve final FGF2 and EGF concentrations of ~10 ng/mL. The clusters of NRs should begin emerging after two medium changes or 5–6 d post‑replating.
