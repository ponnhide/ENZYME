Organoid colonies derived from single cells were manually picked, expanded, and genotyped.
Organoids were randomly taken from whole wells without being segmented and dissociated from the BME with TrypLE and dissociated into single cells. Cells were washed with ice-cold DPBS and filtered into FACS tubes through a 40 μm cell strainer (Falcon). Cells were stained with Hoechst (Beyotime) to identify live cells before FACS analysis. FACS was performed on a BD ...
