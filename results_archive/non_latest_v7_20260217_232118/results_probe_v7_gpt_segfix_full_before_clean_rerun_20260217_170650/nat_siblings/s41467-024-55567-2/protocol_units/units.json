Crypt isolation was performed as previously reported45 with modifications. Briefly, tissues were washed with DPBS to remove debris. The tissues were treated with 2.5 mM EDTA at 4 °C for 40 minutes to release crypts. The supernatant containing crypts was collected and embedded in Cultrex RGF BME (R&D Systems) droplets in 48-well plates (~50 crypts/well). After solidification, droplets were overlaid with culture medium containing 10 μM Y-27632 (TargetMol). The medium was changed every 3 days.",
