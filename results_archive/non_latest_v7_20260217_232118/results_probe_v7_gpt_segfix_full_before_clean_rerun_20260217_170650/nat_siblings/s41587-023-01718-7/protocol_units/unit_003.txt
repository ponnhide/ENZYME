Epicardioids differentiated from AAVS1‑FRT‑flanked STOP‑mKate2‑HA reporter hiPSCs.
we treated 1‑month‑old epicardioids with endothelin‑1 (ET1), a potent vasoconstrictor known to induce dose‑dependent up‑regulation of myocytic hypertrophy markers (NPPA, NPPB, ACTA1 and MYH7/MYH6) and an increase in CM size (Fig. 6a,b).
