In this step, the sections were incubated in 0.05% DAB for 1–2 min before addition of 0.01% H2O2 for a further 1–2 min.
Imaging was performed on an inverted Ti2 microscope (Nikon) equipped with a CSU‑W1 spinning‑disc system (Yokogawa), a sCMOS camera (Teledyne Photometrics), and a 20 × objective. An environment control chamber was used to maintain the temperature at 37 °C and CO2 level at 5% during imaging.
