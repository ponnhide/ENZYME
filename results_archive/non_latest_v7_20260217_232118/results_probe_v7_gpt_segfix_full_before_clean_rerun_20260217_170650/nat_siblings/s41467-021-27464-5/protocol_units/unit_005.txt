Electrophysiological recordings were performed with pCLAMP 10.2 software (Molecular Devices); current was filtered at 0.1 kHz and digitized at 2 kHz. Cells with neuronal morphology and round cell body were selected for recordings. Resting‑membrane potentials were monitored immediately after breaking‑in in current‑clamp mode.
