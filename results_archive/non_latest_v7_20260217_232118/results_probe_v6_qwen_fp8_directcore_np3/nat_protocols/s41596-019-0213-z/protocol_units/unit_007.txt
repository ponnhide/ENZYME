39 Add blocking buffer to permeabilize/block the vascular networks/blood vessel organoids/slides for
2 h at room temperature. For blood vascular networks/blood vessel organoids, add 2 mL of blocking
buffer per tube and rock tube rack (placed vertically on an orbital shaker) for proper blocking/
permeabilization. For slides, encircle the tissue with a liquid blocker pen and add 50–100 μL of
blocking buffer and incubate in a wet chamber.
40 Remove the blocking buffer and add 50–100 μL of primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer
(Table 1). Incubate vessel networks/organoids in an upright position on a rocking shaker at 4 °C
overnight. For sections, incubate in a wet chamber at 4°C overnight.
41 On the next day, wash the samples three times for 10–15 min in PBS-T solution. For vessel
networks/organoids, place the tube rack vertically on an orbital shaker for washing.
42 Add secondary ﬂuorescent antibody (Table 1) in blocking buffer and incubate for 2 h at room
temperature.
43 Wash the samples two times for 10–15 min in PBS-T solution.
44 Add DAPI solution (1:1,000 in PBS) and incubate for 10–15 min.
45 Wash samples in PBS for 10–15 min.
