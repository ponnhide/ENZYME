47 For generating overview images of vascular networks and whole blood vessel organoids (Fig. 2a,e),
we recommend using a confocal microscope with a 10× objective. For visualization of endothelial-
cell–pericyte interaction (Fig. 2f,g), we recommend using a 20× objective, and for imaging vascular
lumen (Fig. 3d) or ﬁlopodia structures (Fig. 3c, right panel), we suggest using a 63× objective.
z-stacks should be acquired with a z-resolution for proper Nyquist sampling (e.g., enable optimal
z-sectioning when using ZEN software).
