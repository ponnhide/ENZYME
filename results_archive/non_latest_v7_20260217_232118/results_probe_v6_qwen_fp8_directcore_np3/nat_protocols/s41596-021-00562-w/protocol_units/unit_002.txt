4 Once incubation period is complete, remove the medium from both sides of the monolayer, and replace it with fixative solution (4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS−/−), with 500 µl on both the apical and basolateral sides of the monolayer. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.
5 Aspirate the fixative solution, and wash the monolayers at least twice with 3% BSA in DPBS−/− (1 ml on the apical side, 2 ml on the basolateral side of the monolayer).
6 Add 500 µl of the permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton X-100 in DPBS−/−) to both apical and basolateral sides of the monolayer. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min.
