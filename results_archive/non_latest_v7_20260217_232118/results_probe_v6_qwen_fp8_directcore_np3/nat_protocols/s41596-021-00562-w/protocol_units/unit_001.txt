1 Make a 10 μM (1×) solution of EdU in both base medium and colon monolayer differentiation medium by diluting the 10 mM (1,000×) stock solution of EdU (component A of the kit).
2 Add 500 µl of the 1× EdU in base medium solution onto the apical side of the monolayer, and 1.5 ml of the 1× EdU in colon monolayer differentiation medium onto the basolateral side of the monolayer.
3 Return monolayers to the incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C), and incubate overnight (16 h).
