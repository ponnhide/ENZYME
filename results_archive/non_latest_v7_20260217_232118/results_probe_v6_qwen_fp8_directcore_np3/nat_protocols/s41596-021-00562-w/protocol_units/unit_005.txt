17 Check the organoid droplets under an inverted microscope to evaluate if the size of most organoids is >100 µm in diameter or larger. Estimate the split ratio to use for passaging organoids to calculate the amount of Matrigel to thaw.
19 Prepare colon organoid growth medium (15 ml for every 24-well plate) by first making up base medium, as described in Table 2, and then using this as a component of colon organoid growth medium, made as described in Table 3.
20 Collect organoid droplets using the medium in which they are currently growing. Using a 1,000 µl pipette, set the pipette to 650 µl (there should be a maximum volume in each well of 50 µl Matrigel and 600 µl medium). Scrape the bottom of the well with the pipette tip to dislodge the Matrigel droplet before drawing up the medium. Place medium and organoids into a 15 ml conical tube. One 24-well plate of organoids should fit into one 15 ml conical tube.
21 Centrifuge the collected Matrigel droplets at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, there should be ~1 ml Matrigel pellet per 24-well plate of organoid droplets collected.
22 Aspirate the supernatant (spent organoid growth medium) with vacuum using a sterile Pasteur pipette.
23 Resuspend the Matrigel pellet in CRS using a 1:10 dilution. For a full 24-well plate of organoids, use 12 ml of CRS. Resuspend the Matrigel droplet by gently inverting the 15 ml conical tube.
24 Incubate the resuspended Matrigel in the ice bucket for 45–60 min, or until Matrigel is dissolved. Mix the Matrigel–CRS solution via gentle inversion every 10–15 min. Organoids will settle at the bottom of the tube when Matrigel is fully dissolved.
25 Centrifuge at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, there should be a noticeable organoid pellet, ~200 µl volume of organoid, depending on the density of the original culture.
