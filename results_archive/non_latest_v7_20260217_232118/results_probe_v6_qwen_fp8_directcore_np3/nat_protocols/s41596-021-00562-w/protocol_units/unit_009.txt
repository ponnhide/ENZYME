Eight hours after the start of coculture (i.e., 6 h after introduction of the inducers), we evaluated the effects of the different culture conditions on bacterial growth, gene circuit activation and epithelial monolayer integrity. The bacteria cell density was measured using optical density at 600 nm. The gene circuit activation by the inducers was determined by measuring the luciferase activity in each strain and condition using the NanoLuc luciferase assay.
