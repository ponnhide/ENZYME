35 Sterilize biosafety cabinet with PREempt disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol.
36 Prepare organoid growth medium (15 ml for every plate) according to Table 3. Medium should be prepared fresh each time, as the small molecules and proteins can become unstable if they remain in the medium for a long time.
37 Carefully aspirate the medium from each of the wells using a vacuum aspirator and a sterile Pasteur pipette. When aspirating, tilt the plate toward yourself and press the pipette tip against the bottom of the well to avoid disrupting the Matrigel droplet adhered in the center of the well.
38 Add 600 µl of medium per well by carefully loading into the side of the well to avoid disturbing the Matrigel droplet.
