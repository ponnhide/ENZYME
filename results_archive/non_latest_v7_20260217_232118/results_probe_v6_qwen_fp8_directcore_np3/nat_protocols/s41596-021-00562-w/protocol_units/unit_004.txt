4 Thaw an appropriate number of Matrigel aliquots in a 4 °C fridge (1.2 ml Matrigel is required for a full 24-well plate of organoids droplets).
5 Prepare base medium, colon organoid growth medium and washing medium as described in Table 2, Table 3 and Materials. For a full 24-well plate with organoid droplets, 15 ml of colon organoid growth medium is required.
6 Obtain a cryovial of organoids from the liquid nitrogen tank, and place it into a 37 °C water bath. Hold in the water bath until thawed (~1 min).
7 Bring the cryovial into the biosafety cabinet after spaying the outer surface with 70% ethanol.
8 Add 1 ml of washing medium to the cryovial, resuspend the organoids gently and then transfer the content of the cryotube to the 15 mL conical tube that already contains 10 ml of washing medium. Fill the tube with additional washing medium up to 15 ml.
9 Centrifuge at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. During centrifugation, prepare the material for the subsequent steps: sterilize a glass dish with PREempt disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol. Add ice to 50–70% capacity of the glass dish, spray with 70% ethanol again and place the dish into the biosafety cabinet. Put Matrigel aliquots into the aluminum cooling block. Spray thoroughly with 70% ethanol, and place gently into the glass dish containing ice.
10 After centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant (washing medium) with vacuum using a sterile Pasteur pipette.
11 Resuspend the organoid pellet with 1.2 ml of Matrigel and seed 50 µl droplets into each well of an Olympus 24-well, tissue culture treated plate.
