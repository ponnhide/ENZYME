26 Aspirate CRS using vacuum and a sterile Pasteur pipette. After aspiration, place the conical tube into the glass dish containing ice.
27 Calculate the volume needed for the desired splitting ratio allowing 50 μl of Matrigel per well (i.e., 1.2 ml Matrigel per 24-well plate). A typical splitting ratio is 1:3 to 1:5, but this varies and depends on the density of the original culture, length of culture since original thaw, and donor intrinsic growth behavior.
28 Keep the tube on ice, and resuspend the organoid pellet in a maximum of 1 ml of Matrigel. If the total volume required is <1 ml, add the required volume; for example, if 900 µl is needed to achieve the desired splitting ratio, add 900 µl.
29 Bend a 1,000 µl pipette tip by pressing down the pipette tip on the inside of the cap for the conical tube. Use this bent tip to pipette the Matrigel suspension 25 times if organoids are in the first passage after thawing. Otherwise pipette the Matrigel suspension 50 times. After resuspension, check the level of organoid fragmentation under an inverted microscope. If further dissociation is needed, return conical tube to ice in the biosafety cabinet, continue pipetting with bent pipette tip 25 more times and reexamine under the microscope. Repeat until mostly fragments remain.
30 Once organoids have been fragmented, add the remaining Matrigel needed (calculated in Step 27) to achieve the desired passaging ratio. Mix the Matrigel–organoid fragment suspension well before proceeding to the next step.
31 Seed 50 µl droplets of the fragment suspension into each well of an Olympus 24-well, tissue culture treated plate.
