The conﬂuent monolayers are differentiated for an additional 4 d and then cocultured with bacteria.
TEER measurement is optional, but we recommend it be performed at key timepoints (e.g., D7, D10 and D14), particularly prior to coculture with bacteria at D14 and after medium collection at D14. The procedure for TEER measurement is described in Steps 67–79.
