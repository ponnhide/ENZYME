Turn on rotating oven and allow it to heat up to 37 °C while you prepare your sample.\n2. Obtain a 60 mm cell culture dish containing ~7 mL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.\n3. Add 150 µL of pre-aliquoted DNase (10 mg/mL) to each dish.\n4. Obtain ~250 mg of human brain tissue per sample. Document case details.\n ▲ Caution Local institutional guidelines should always be followed when using human\n source materials since they can contain blood-borne pathogens. These protocols probably\n will include training, proper engineering and personal barrier protections.\n5. Place in dish containing HBSS/BSA/glucose + DNase.\n ▲ Critical step It is crucial DNase is added to the solution at this step otherwise digestion\n will be inadequate. See also the troubleshooting advice for Steps 9 and 54.\n6. With a scalpel, cut tissue into small (~2 mm × 2 mm chunks) in HBSS/BSA/glucose + DNase\n solution in a sterile environment (Fig. 2).\n ▲ Critical step Ideally, dissection should occur in a cell culture biosafety cabinet. If this\n is not possible, the tissue can be dissected outside of a hood with attention paid to best\n aseptic technique.\n\nNature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 616\n\nProtocol extension\n\n\n7. Distribute tissue into three 15 mL conical tubes.\n • Aliquot the tissue–buffer solution in the dish into the tubes first\n • Use extra HBSS/BSA/glucose buffer to wash the dish and make up to\n 5 mL per tube\n8. Add 167 µL of collagenase/dispase (100 mg/mL) to each tube. Please note,\n 167 µL of collagenase/dispase per 5 mL is equivalent to 33.4 µL of solution\n per 1 mL.\n9. Digest for 30 min in rotating oven at 37 °C.\n ▲ Critical step Optimal enzymatic digestion is the most important factor\n to maximize yield. Therefore, this step may need optimizing to achieve\n sufficient but not too much digestion. See also the troubleshooting advice\n for Step 54.\n ◆ Troubleshooting\n10. Spin down for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.\n\nPercoll density gradient centrifugation\n● Timing ~35 min\n11. After samples have finished spinning, discard the supernatant by pouring out the liquid into\n a waste container.\n ▲ Critical step Do not aspirate the supernatant during the cell dissociation and\n digestion, as the cell pellet may be aspirated and lost.\n12. Add 1 mL of HBSS/BSA/glucose and 50 µL of pre-aliquoted DNase (10 mg/mL) into each\n sample tube.\n13. Gently mix/resuspend 50 times using a micropipette, taking care not to introduce bubbles,\n which may detrimentally affect the cells49.\n14. Obtain two additional 15 mL conical tubes per each sample tube. For example, for three\n sample digestion tubes, obtain six tubes for Percoll filtration.\n ▲ Critical step Yield will be compromised if each digestion is not distributed into two\n Percoll tubes.\n15. Dispense 4 mL of 22% Percoll into each new conical tube.\n16. Carefully dispense cell suspension from each sample tube into the new conical tubes\n containing 22% Percoll in equal amounts. Use ~750 µL per tube.\n ▲ Critical step The cell suspension should be dispensed on top of\n the Percoll.\n17. Spin down for 10 min at 500g, 4 °C with no deceleration.\n18. Discard supernatant.\n19. Reunite contents of all Percoll tubes into one tube by resuspending the cell pellet\n in the HBSS/BSA/glucose remaining after pouring out the supernatant.\n20. Spin down the sample tube for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.\n21. Do not discard the remaining tubes. The small amount of cells left over after combining\n the majority of cells into one tube for the master mix can be used for unstained and DAPI\n controls (Steps 36–45).\n\nMaster mix preparation\n● Timing ~1–5 min\n22. Add 200 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose into a fresh tube.\n23. Add 2 µL of each antibody and 1 µL of DAPI into the tube containing 200 µL of HBSS/BSA/\n glucose per sample.\n Ab/Stain Dilution Volume\n DAPI 1:200 1 μL\n CD45 PE–Cy7 1:100 2 μL\n CD146 PE 1:100 2 μL\n ANPEP APC 1:100 2 μL\n CD31 FITC 1:100 2 μL\n\n\nNature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 617\n\nProtocol extension\n\n\nImmunostaining\n● Timing ~30 min\n24. After samples have finished spinning, discard supernatant.\n25. Resuspend in ~200 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.\n26. Add the master mix into the tube of resuspended cells.\n27. Incubate for 15 min on ice. During this sample incubation, start preparing controls by\n following Steps 36–45.\n28. Wash with 5 mL of HBSS/BSA/glucose and mix.\n29. Spin down for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.\n30. Discard supernatant.\n • Note the amount of supernatant remaining in the tube; 500 µL of supernatant is\n needed to resuspend\n • Add additional HBSS/BSA/glucose if below the recommended 500 µL needed to\n resuspend\n31. Resuspend cells.\n32. Obtain one FACS tube and a 70 µm filter.\n33. With the filter over the FACS tube, dispense the resuspended cells through the filter and into\n the FACS tube.\n34. Seal the tube and place on ice.\n ▲ Critical step Cells should be analyzed as soon as possible. Longer periods of\n dissociation may compromise cell viability.\n35. Take samples to FACS.\n\nControl (cell) tube preparation\n● Timing ~5 min\n▲ Critical A total of six controls are needed (see Step 43). We recommend only using cells for\nthe unstained and DAPI controls because they cannot be performed with beads. This strategy\ndoes not waste cells on fluorescence controls and optimizes yield. However, if the user prefers\nnot to use beads, cells can be used for all controls. In that case, a small part of the sample should\nbe removed for control staining.\n36. Obtain the three leftover 15 mL tubes after combining sample contents into one tube (Step 19).\n37. Sequentially, rinse each tube with ~500 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose and combine into one tube.\n38. Obtain six fresh FACS tubes and fresh 70 µm filters.\n39. With the filters on top of the FACS tubes, dispense 250 µL of combined buffer rinse into two\n of the FACS tubes.\n40. Proceed to Step 41.\n\nControl (beads) tube preparation and immunostaining\n● Timing ~5 min\n41. Dispense 250 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose into each of the four remaining FACS tubes.\n ▲ Critical step If using cells rather than beads as controls, add at least 10,000 cells per\n tube in HBSS/BSA/glucose.\n42. Add 2.5 µL of a single antibody to each single-color control tube into the FACS tubes\n containing 250 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.\n43. For the live/dead stain, add 1.25 µL of DAPI into the FACS tubes containing 250 µL\n of combined buffer/cell rinse. One tube will be unstained.\n FACS tube Ab/stain Dilution Buffer volume Ab/stain volume\n 1 DAPI 1:200 250 µL 1.25 μL\n 2 CD45 PE–Cy7 1:100 250 µL 2.5 μL\n 3 CD146 PE 1:100 250 µL 2.5 μL\n 4 ANPEP APC 1:100 250 µL 2.5 μL\n 5 CD31 FITC 1:100 250 µL 2.5 μL\n 6 Unstained NA 250 µL NA\n\n\nNature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 618\n\nProtocol extension\n\n\n44. After adding antibodies as explained in Step 43, shake the UltraComp eBead\n vial and add one drop of beads to each single-color control with the ‘Ready to Use’\n bottle. Please note, beads are designed to bind antibodies and eliminate the need\n to use cells for many controls. Therefore, do not add beads to DAPI and unstained\n controls. If cells are being used for all controls, then do not add beads to any of\n the controls.\n45. Seal the tubes and place on ice.\n\nFACS\n● Timing ~2 h\n▲ Critical Every flow cytometry system will have slightly different procedures. Here are\nhigh-yield principles to execute a successful flow cytometry experiment.\n46. Set the laser levels for each of your fluorophores with unstained and single-color controls.\n47. Once the laser levels are set, then run the single-color controls again to record each\n fluorophore. After every single-color control has been run, the machine can perform\n compensation, the method of correcting for fluorescence spill over.\n48. Once the laser levels are set and compensation performed, the user can draw gates to select\n sequential populations (Fig. 3a). For this strategy, we recommend first eliminating debris\n with side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) gates. These are size and complexity\n parameters.\n49. Next, eliminate doublets also with SSC or FSC.\n50. Eliminate dead cells. We use DAPI but a number of live/dead stains exist in different\n fluorophores.\n51. After eliminating debris, doublets and dead cells, then the user should set up\n FACS plots to select their population of interests. In our studies, endothelial\n cells were isolated as CD45−CD31+ANPEP− and mural cells were isolated as\n CD45−CD31−ANPEP+.\n52. (Optional) Run additional controls to determine the true population. These may include\n ‘fluorescence minus one’ controls and unstained controls.\n53. After the population has been defined, use a 100 µm nozzle to perform cell sorting.\n ▲ Critical step A smaller filter may damage the cells.\n54. Translate the ‘event number’ readout from the cell sorter into a true cell number,\n a parameter termed ‘efficiency’21. This calculation may be necessary for downstream\n applications.\n ◆ Troubleshooting\n55. After sorting several downstream procedures can be performed:\n • Follow Steps 56–95 for 2D culture of purified mural and endothelial cells.\n 3D culture or metabolic measurements can also be performed as described\n previously14\n • Follow Steps 96–114 for the transplantation of cells into brain organoids\n • Follow Steps 115–132 for single-cell transcriptomic analysis\n\nPlating cells\n● Timing ~1 h\nCollagen coating\n● Timing ~35 min\n56. Obtain a 24-well plate.\n57. Calculate the amount of collagen coating solution needed. We recommend 500 µL of\n collagen coating solution (0.03 mg/mL) per well.\n58. Add 500 µL of collagen coating solution (0.03 mg/mL) into each well.\n59. Incubate plate with collagen for 30 min at 37 °C.\n60. After incubation, remove collagen coating solution from all wells.\n61. Wash wells once with 1× PBS and then they are ready to use (if not using immediately,\n keep PBS in the wells and store in 37 °C incubator until the sorted cells are ready to\n be plated).\n\nNature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 619\n\nProtocol extension\n\n\nPlating\n● Timing ~10 min\n62. Spin down sorted mural and/or endothelial cell tubes (from Step 54) by centrifuging for\n 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.\n63. After spinning, remove supernatant from microcentrifuge tubes containing cells.\n64. Add 500 µL of prewarmed (37 °C) growth medium into microcentrifuge tubes containing\n mural or endothelial cell pellets.\n65. Resuspend.\n66. Add the desired amount of cell solution into collagen-coated wells. We recommend filling\n each culture well with cell solution to approximately half volume.\n67. Add additional 500 µL of growth medium into wells containing cells for 1 mL total\n per well.\n68. Add 500 µL of 1× PBS to all other empty wells to keep them from drying.\n69. Place in a 37 °C incubator.\n\nCell culture\nChanging media\n● Timing ~10 min\n70. Determine the amount of EGM-2 medium required for passaging based on plates and/or\n wells required. Aliquot endothelial cell growth medium in a 50 mL conical tube.\n71. Obtain plates with cells from 37 °C incubator.\n72. Place new tip on vacuum. Aspirate the old growth medium from the plates.\n73. Using a serological pipette, add 1× PBS to each plate. For a 24-well plate, we recommend\n 0.5 mL per well. Swirl each plate, then vacuum off the majority of PBS.\n ◆ Troubleshooting\n74. Using another serological pipette, add fresh growth medium to each plate. For a 24-well\n plate, we recommend 0.5 mL per well. Swirl each plate once.\n75. Place plates back into the 37 °C incubator.\n76. Repeat Steps 70–75 to change media approximately every other day. Monitor confluency\n and when confuency has reached 75–80%, proceed to passaging (Step 77).\n ◆ Troubleshooting\n\nPassaging and FACS\n● Timing ~30 min plus FACS\n▲ Critical Ideal cell confluency for high-yield FACS and cell health is 75–80% plate coverage.\n77. Aliquot endothelial cell growth medium in a 50 mL conical tube.\n78. Obtain plates with cells from 37 °C incubator.\n79. Place new tip on vacuum. Vacuum out the old growth medium from the plates.\n ◆ Troubleshooting\n80. Using a serological pipette, add 1× PBS to each plate. For a 24-well plate, we recommend\n 0.5 mL per well. Swirl each plate, then vacuum out the PBS.\n ◆ Troubleshooting\n81. Using another serological pipette, add 0.5 mL of trypsin to each well. Swirl each plate once.\n82. Place plates back into the 37 °C incubator.\n83. In ~5 min, remove the plates from the incubator.\n84. View the plates under the microscope. Ensure that cells are no longer adhered to the bottom\n of the plate. Tap the bottom of the plates if necessary.\n ▲ Critical step Ensure that cells are beginning to round up before attempting to dislodge\n them from the plate. If cells are over-digested, their viability will be compromised. If cells\n are not sufficiently digested, then they will not come up from the plate.\n ◆ Troubleshooting\n85. Set up the appropriate number of 15 mL conical tubes (one tube per well).\n86. Add 1 mL of the HBSS/BSA/glucose buffer to each 15 mL conical tube (or 6 mL to each\n 50 mL tube).\n87. Tap the bottom of plates once again to ensure cells are not stuck on the bottom.\n\nNature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 620\n\nProtocol extension\n\n\n88. Gently tilt each plate and remove trypsin and cells using a serological pipette. Add to the\n appropriate conical tube containing the HBSS/BSA/glucose buffer.\n89. Wash the plate one more time with 1 mL HBSS/BSA/glucose buffer to catch remaining cells,\n then discard empty plates.\n90. Spin down tubes for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.\n91. To validate cell-surface marker expression of the vascular cells for downstream\n assays, perform FACS as in Steps 46–54 (Fig. 4b). Otherwise proceed directly to\n Step 93.\n • If evaluating mural cells use this master mix and plate for all live cells\n after FACS:\n Ab/stain Dilution Volume\n DAPI 1:200 1 μL\n CD140b PE 1:100 2 μL\n ANPEP PeCy7 1:100 2 μL\n CD31 FITC 1:100 2 μL\n\n\n • If evaluating endothelial cells use this master mix and plate for all live cells\n after FACS:\n Ab/stain Dilution Volume\n DAPI 1:200 1 μL\n CD45 PE–Cy7 1:100 2 μL\n CD146 PE 1:100 2 μL\n ANPEP APC 1:100 2 μL\n CD31 FITC 1:100 2 μL\n\n\nReplating\n● Timing ~10 min\n92. Spin down tubes containing sorted cells for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.\n93. Discard supernatant and add growth medium to tubes containing the pellet of cells so the\n total tube volume is 1 mL. For one well of a 24-well plate, we recommend 20,000–30,000\n cells, which should become confluent within 5 d.\n94. Add growth medium to each plate. Place into incubator.\n ◆ Troubleshooting\n95. Repeat Steps 56–94 to maintain cells in 2D culture. Alternatively:\n • Follow Steps 96–114 for the transplantation of cells into brain organoids\n • Follow Steps 115–132 for single-cell transcriptomic analysis\n • The cells can also be used in Matrigel 3D angiogenesis cultures or metabolic studies\n (such as Seahorse assays)14\n\nOrganoids\nCell transplant\n● Timing ~2 h\n▲ Critical Grow and maintain organoids as described previously32,44,45. We perform\ntransplantations after the organoids have been differentiated and maintained for 7–9 weeks.\nEach user will need to determine their targeted neural population for vascular cell coculture and\ngrow the organoids to that stage.\n96. Collect mural and/or endothelial cells sorted in Step 54.\n97. Immediately after sorting, infect the cell population of interest with AAV–CMV–\n GFP. Mix the cell solution thoroughly using a pipette. We use 1 µL (stock titer of\n 1 × 1013 GF/mL; 200 multiplicity of infection (MOI)) for 50,000 cells. Place cells at 37 °C\n for 30 min.\n98. To avoid viral leakage into the organoids, wash cells three times with 1× PBS, each time\n spinning down at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C.\n\nNature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 621\n\nProtocol extension\n\n\n 99. Select organoids for transplantation. Preferred organoids should display spherical shape\n and clear edges without any cell debris. Organoids vary in size, so a variety of organoid\n sizes will be used within a given experimental condition; ensure that you distribute\n different sizes across conditions.\n100. Using a wide-opening pipette tip, move number of desired organoids onto Millicell culture\n inserts in a 6-well flat-bottom plate. Transwells help prevent the organoid from moving\n as the vascular cells are incorporated during the transplants. We recommend three to six\n organoids per condition.\n ▲ Critical step Use a wide-opening p1000 µL pipette tip to maintain the organoid\n structure.\n ◆ Troubleshooting\n101. Immediately before adding cells, gently remove as much medium surrounding the\n organoids within the well as possible using a p1000 pipette.\n102. Gently add desired amount of cells on top of the organoids and incubate at 37 °C for\n 30 min.\n ▲ Critical step Per organoid, we recommend not adding more than 50 µL to ensure that\n the cells stay on top of the organoid initially and do not float away.\n103. After incubation, gently add medium to well insert until the organoid floats off of the\n insert, ~3 mL.\n104. Maintain organoids in a 37 °C incubator. The transwell can be removed the day after\n transplantation. After transplantation, maintain the organoids submerged in medium.\n Change media three times a week for up to 2 weeks, or the duration of the transplantation\n experiments (Fig. 5b, day 1, stage 1). When transplantation experiments are complete, if\n samples need to be prepared for frozen sectioning proceed to Step 105.\n ◆ Troubleshooting\n\nFreezing\n● Timing ~8 h\n▲ Critical For an overview of the workflow, see Fig. 5b.\n105. After 2 weeks and using wide-opening pipette tips, transfer organoids to a 24-well\n flat-bottom plate and aspirate excess medium. Up to six organoids can be transferred\n per well. PBS washing before fixation is not necessary (Fig. 5b, day 1, stages 2, 3).\n ▲ Critical step Do not combine different conditions or transfer types into the\n same well.\n106. Add 0.5–1 mL of 4% PFA to the organoid wells to cover organoids. Leave the organoids\n for 30 min at room temperature (Fig. 5b, day 1, stage 4).\n107. Remove PFA with a pipette and wash with 0.5–1 mL 1× PBS three times for 10 min (Fig. 5b,\n day 1, stage 5).\n108. Remove PBS with a pipette and resuspend in 0.5–1 mL 30% sucrose. Store overnight\n (or ~6 h) at 4 °C until organoids sink to the bottom of the well (Fig. 5b, day 1, Step 6).\n Please note that the incubation will depend on organoid size; larger organoids take\n longer to sink.\n109. Remove excess sucrose from wells and replace with 0.5–1 mL 50/50 mix of 30% sucrose and\n blue OCT. Store overnight (or ~6 h) at 4 °C (Fig. 5b, day 2, stages 7 and 8).\n110. Remove excess 50/50 sucrose/OCT mix and resuspend in 0.5–1 mL clear OCT.\n111. Fill embedding blocks with OCT and label appropriately\n112. Using wide-opening tips, gently pipette out organoids and place in embedding blocks\n (Fig. 5b, day 3, stages 9 and 10).\n ◆ Troubleshooting\n113. Use a pipette tip to help them sink to the bottom of the OCT and place on dry ice (Fig. 5b,\n day 3, stage 11).\n114. Store in a −80 °C freezer until time for sectioning. We use standard procedures to section\n samples and for subsequent analysis using immunofluorescence14.\n ■ Pause point Slides may be kept at −80 °C for up to 1 year without compromising\n their quality.\n\nNature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 622\n\nProtocol extension\n\n\nscRNA-seq\nSingle-cell library preparation\n● Timing ~8 h\n115. Collect mural and/or endothelial cells sorted in Step 54. Immediately after sorting, begin\n library preparation.\n116. Perform library preparation using a 10x Genomics Chromium Next GEM single cell\n 3′ reagent kit based on the manufacturer’s instructions. For our experiments, we used\n v3.1 10x Genomics kits.\n\nSequencing\n● Timing varies (can be a few hours to a few days depending on the instrument).\n117. Perform qPCR-based quantification, fragment analysis and sequencing (our prepared\n libraries were sent to the UCSF Institute for Human Genetics Genomics Core to do this):\n • Perform qPCR-based quantification to determine the concentration of each library\n using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina Platforms\n • Determine sequencing depth based on your desired coverage for each library.\n 10x Genomics recommends sequencing a minimum of 20,000 reads/cell for most\n single-cell 3′ gene expression libraries\n • After using the 10x Genomics reagent kits to prepare your libraries, perform\n paired-end sequencing using Illumina’s constructs\n118. Obtain sequenced files in FASTQ format, ready for downstream bioinformatic analysis.\n ◆ Troubleshooting\n\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nAligning FASTQ files and generating feature-barcode matrices using Cell Ranger\n● Timing varies depending on computing power\n▲ Critical For downstream analysis, FASTQ files must be aligned to a reference transcriptome\nand converted into feature–barcode matrices, also known as count matrices. 10x Genomics\nprovides Cell Ranger, a collection of analysis pipelines, to process its Chromium single-cell data.\nCellranger count is a pipeline within Cell Ranger that aligns sequencing reads in FASTQ files to a\nreference transcriptome and generates feature–barcode matrices.\n119. Using the cellranger count pipeline, align FASTQ files to the reference transcriptome of\n interest and generate count matrices for each sample.\n • We used the human reference transcriptome GRCh38 for our sequencing reads.\n Species-relevant transcriptomes are available for download from the 10x Genomics\n website or a comparable resource\n • A more detailed description of the cellranger count pipeline can be found at https://\n support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/\n using/count\n\nPreprocessing of scRNA-seq data using Seurat in R\n● Timing varies depending on computing power\n120. Seurat is an R package that offers methods for quality control, analysis and exploration of\n scRNA-seq data50. Using the Read10x function within Seurat, import the feature–barcode\n matrices for each sample into R. A guided tutorial on clustering data with Seurat can be\n found at https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html\n121. Convert each feature–barcode matrix into individual Seurat objects using the\n CreateSeuratObject function within Seurat. Note that once a seurat object is created\n for a given sample, any additional sample information (e.g., age of the collected\n sample, brain region, etc.) can be added to the metadata of that seurat object. One can\n add this information using: samplefilename@meta.data[“Columnname”] <- “sample\n information”.\n122. Filter out low-quality cells. We filtered using the following criteria:\n • Greater than 200 unique genes (features) detected in each cell. Empty droplets or dead\n cells will have very few genes, while doublets will have many\n\nNature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 623\n\nProtocol extension\n\n\n • Greater than 500 unique molecular identifiers detected in each cell. Empty droplets or\n dead cells will have very few unique molecular identifiers\n • Less than 10% mitochondrial reads in each cell. A high mitochondrial percentage in a\n given cell typically indicates cellular stress or damage\n Our workflow to filter out low-quality cells is adapted from guidelines provided by the\n Harvard Bioinformatics core (https://github.com/hbctraining/scRNA-seq_online/tree/\n master/lessons).\n123. If necessary, combine multiple datasets using the merge function within Seurat.\n124. Perform data normalization using the NormalizeData function within Seurat.\n125. Identify highly variable features using the FindVariableFeatures function within\n Seurat and specify the selection method. We used the default method (vst) and default\n number of variable features (2,000) to identify 2,000 highly variable genes for this\n dataset.\n126. Scale data using the ScaleData function within Seurat\n\nDimensionality reduction and clustering\n● Timing varies depending on computing power\n127. Run principal component analysis with all high variable genes found in Step 125. Selecting\n the number of principal components to add to the Uniform Manifold Approximation\n and Projection (UMAP) analysis can be done using Jackstraw plot analysis to remove any\n principal components that are negligible51.\n128. If necessary, perform batch correction. We recommend Harmony, which uses an\n iterative clustering approach to account for batch effects arising from multiple\n samples. Harmony can be run within our Seurat workflow based on the standard\n integration pipeline in Harmony’s documentation. A guided tutorial on removing\n batch effects with Harmony can be found at https://github.com/immunogenomics/\n harmony.\n ◆ Troubleshooting\n129. Perform unsupervised clustering using Seurat’s FindNeighbors and FindClusters\n functions. The FindClusters function allows one to control the resolution of\n clustering, where a higher resolution value leads to a larger number of smaller\n clusters, while a lower resolution value leads to a smaller number of larger clusters.\n This parameter needs to be optimized for each dataset, depending on the desired\n specificity for cell type identification. For our dataset, the optimal resolution\n was 0.5. We selected a resolution that produced well separated and biologically\n meaningful clusters.\n130. Visualize clusters via UMAP using Seurat package.\n\nLabeling clusters\n● Timing ~1.5 h\n131. Labeling using ScType. Run the ScType package to label clusters using a reference\n database of cell type signatures. This package offers several reference databases for\n labeling, covering various tissues and cell types; however, one can also create their own\n reference database. We created a reference database specific to our cell types of interest\n based on gene sets from the literature. A more detailed description of the ScType package\n can be found at https://github.com/IanevskiAleksandr/sc-type.\n132. Alternatively, manual labeling can be used. Similar to ScType, this method involves\n identifying marker genes for each cluster and comparing them with known cell-type\n signatures. To manually label clusters using Seurat:\n • Identify marker genes using the FindAllMarkers function within Seurat\n • Using the writexl package create an excel file with your marker genes by cluster\n • Compare the marker genes from each cluster with known cell type signatures from the\n literature or reference databases\n • Assign labels to each cluster based on the best match with the known cell type\n signatures using the RenameIdents function within Seurat\n\nNature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 624\n\nProtocol extension\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nTroubleshooting advice can be found in Table 2.\n\n\nTable 2 | Troubleshooting table\n\nStep Problem Possible reason Solution\n9 Digestion does not result in DNase and collagenase may not be Do not store −20 °C aliquots in a freezer with automated defrosting.

This DNA is sticky and can damage cells with trituration if DNase\n is not present\n54 Poor yields from FACS Digestion was inadequate Vascular cells are very sensitive to mechanical dissociation38 (Fig. 6a). If\n poor yields are obtained, we recommend scrutinizing the digestion for any\n problems first before pointing to other steps. If the enzymatic digestion is\n incomplete, the cells can be dissociated mechanically but the yields will\n decrease. The digestion may be suboptimal because too much tissue is\n placed in each digestion tube, because the enzyme is too old or has had\n repeated freeze–thaw cycles and is inactive, or because the tissue was not\n agitated or rotated with digestion and the enzyme was not well distributed\n Procedure took too long We do not recommend that one person process more than 1 cm3 of tissue\n because the number of Percoll tubes become unwieldy. If the digestion and\n dissociation procedure takes much longer than 3 h, the cell yield may decrease\n PMI was too long For PMI, we have performed scRNA-seq with samples less than 24 h PMI,\n but after that the cell quality declines (Fig. 6e)\n Cells were collected in tubes Bring microcentrifuge vials containing 50 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose for\n without buffer collection.

Larger pieces of tissue will probably require more time because the procedure\nmust be scaled up proportionally (please see troubleshooting). FACS, including establishing\ncompensation with controls, requires another 3 h. The endothelial and mural cells can be placed\nin culture immediately after FACS. The procedures for organoid transplants will require an\nadditional 2 h.\n\nCell dissociation and digestion\nSteps 1–10, Cell dissociation and digestion: ~1 h\nSteps 11–21, Percoll density gradient centrifugation/filtration: ~35 min\nSteps 22–23, Master mix preparation: ~5 min\nSteps 24–35, Immunostaining: ~30 min\nSteps 36–40, Control (cell) tube preparation: ~5 min\nSteps 41–45, Control bead tube preparation and immunostaining: ~5 min\n\nFACS\nSteps 46–55, FACS: ~2 h\n\nCulture of FACS-purified vascular cells\nSteps 56–61, Collagen coat: ~35 min\nSteps 62–69, Plating: ~10 min\nSteps 70–76, Changing media: ~10 min\nSteps 77–91, Passaging and FACS: ~30 min + FACS\nSteps 92–95, Replating: ~10 min\n\nOrganoid transplants\nSteps 96–104, Cell transplantation: ~2 h\nSteps 105–114, Freezing: ~8 h\n\nTranscriptomic analysis\nSteps 115–116, Single-cell library preparation: ~8 h\nSteps 117–118, Sequencing: varies\nSteps 119–126, Preprocessing of scRNA-seq data using R: varies\nSteps 127–130, Dimensionality reduction and clustering: varies\nSteps 131–132, Labeling clusters: ~1.5 h\n\n\nAnticipated results\n\nWhen starting with ~1 cm3 of tissue, ~30,000 endothelial cell events and 100,000 mural cell\nevents should be obtained after FACS. Once the cells are placed in culture, they will initially\ndouble in ~5 d (passage 1), and then decrease their doubling time (subsequent passages,\nFig. 4a). Mural cells in general are more proliferative than endothelial. In regards to the choice\nof CD31 and ANPEP as cell surface markers for flow cytometry, respectively, we find that they\nare suitable ‘pan’ endothelial and mural cell markers based on the following criteria: (1) all\nthe endothelial and mural cell subtypes are captured14 and (2) other human brain scRNA-seq\ndatasets do not find expression of these markers in nonvascular cells in prenatal22 or adult\nhuman brain6,9. We also did not find vascular genes expressed in other cell populations (Fig. 3c).\nOf note, we and others6,9 find that the human brain has more mural cells than endothelial, in\ncontrast to the adult mouse brain20. Endothelial cells also seem to be more delicate and sensitive\nto PMI (Fig. 6e,f). If cells purified as endothelial cells do not express bona fide endothelial cell\n\nNature Protocols | Volume 19 | March 2024 | 603–628 626\n\nProtocol extension\n\n\nmarkers at the transcriptomic level, consider whether your protocol is too harsh or the PMI was\ntoo long.\n For organoid transplants, vascular cells should integrate into the organoids quickly. GFP\nturns on within 24 h and can be visualized easily within 3 d. Unfortunately, we have not found\nother methods of visualization to be helpful: we do not see morphological differences on\nbrightfield microscopy, for example. Since adenoviruses do not integrate into DNA, the GFP\nexpression is these experiments is not stable. If the cells divide, the signal is depleted over time.\nIn nondividing cells, expression is maintained for the life of the cell. We did not observe CD34 or\nPDGFR-β in cells that did not express GFP in our experiments after 2 weeks14 (also Fig. 5c).\n In our experiments, the organoid environment enriched for one dominant endothelial\nand mural cell subtype14, but alternative culture conditions may enrich for different subtypes.\nOf note, it is important to perform experiments to determine that endothelial and mural cells\nmaintain their identity upon transplantation, as organoids have transcriptomic differences,\nincluding cellular stress, that may lead to phenotypic differences in vascular cells32. This could\nbe determined via immunohistochemistry or RNAscope. We performed immunohistochemistry\nfor CD34 for endothelial cells and PDGFR-β for mural cells14 before proceeding with\nexperiments to determine their subtypes and their effects on neural cells (Fig. 5c). We and\nothers have consistently found that vascular cells influence neural cell differentiation and\nproliferation in culture and in organoids2,14,20. Given the pervasiveness of these effects in\ndifferent model systems, we would anticipate these results across a variety of neurovascular\ninteractions. However, probing specific stages of neurovascular interactions may reveal new\ndiscoveries. In addition, vascular cells should improve cell stress in the organoids14.",
