Here we describe a strategy for directed\n differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into distal lung organoids. This protocol recapitulates lung development by\n sequentially specifying human pluripotent stem cells to deﬁnitive endoderm, anterior foregut endoderm, ventral anterior\n foregut endoderm, lung bud organoids and ﬁnally lung organoids. The organoids take ~40 d to generate and can be\n maintained more than 180 d, while progressively maturing up to a stage consistent with the second trimester of human\n gestation. They are unique because of their branching morphology, the near absence of non-lung endodermal lineages,\n1234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;\n\n\n presence of mesenchyme and capacity to recapitulate interstitial lung diseases. This protocol can be performed by anyone\n familiar with cell culture techniques, is conducted in serum-free conditions and does not require lineage-speciﬁc reporters\n or enrichment steps. We also provide a protocol for the generation of single-cell suspensions for single-cell RNA\n sequencing.\n\n\n Introduction\n Organoids are used to study human development and to model disease1,2. Among others, major\n progress has been made in the generation of lung organoids3,4. The lung epithelium contains multiple\n cell types, including basal, ciliated, secretory, goblet and neuroendocrine cells in the airways, and\n alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) and surfactant-producing alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells in the\n alveoli, where gas exchange takes place4,5. In addition, several novel transitional cell populations have\n been identiﬁed in the human distal lung respiratory airway or terminal respiratory bronchioles, very\n small airways in which alveoli empty and that contain more extensive alveoli at their distal tips6–8.\n The respiratory system originates from buds that arise on the ventral aspect of the anterior foregut\n endoderm (AFE) during embryonic stage (E9.5–E12.5 in the mouse, 4–7 post-conception weeks\n (pcw) in humans). These undergo a stereotyped branching process during the pseudoglandular stage\n (E12.5–E16.5 in the mouse, 5–17 pcw in humans). During the canalicular stage (E16.5–E17.5 in the\n mouse, 16–26 pcw in humans) cell cycle activity decreases and specialization of the airway epithelium\n occurs in the stalks, with the emergence of basal, goblet, club, ciliated and other cell types. This stage\n is followed by the saccular stage, where the canaliculi widen into sacculations that will give rise to\n primitive alveoli (E17.5 to birth in the mouse, 26–38 pcw in humans)5,9–11. Expansion of alveolar\n number by further differentiation of immature saccules, alveolar maturation and secondary septation\n continue predominantly postnatally (alveolar stage, postnatal days 0–21 (d0–21) in mice, 38 pcw to\n the age of 21 years in humans)11,12. Generating organoids that at least partially model human lung\n development requires recapitulating this process to the extent possible in vitro.\n\n 1\n Columbia Center for Human Development/Center for Stem Cell Therapies, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.\n 2\n Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. 3Department of Genetic and Genomic Sciences, Icahn\n School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. 4The Center for Advanced Genomic Technology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,\n New York, NY, USA. 5Department of Otolaryngology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. 6Department of Cell,\n Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. 7Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Icahn\n School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. 8Institute for Airway Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.\n 9\n Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. 10These authors contributed equally:\n Ivana Matkovic Leko, Remy T.

Scale bars, 200 μm.\n\n\n Since the ﬁrst reports on their establishment from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)13,14,\n several publications showed the generation of lung organoids, either from fetal or adult lung15–18 or\n from hPSCs19–26. We developed a directed differentiation strategy of hPSCs (both embryonic stem\n cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)) into three-dimensional (3D) lung organoids\n that undergo a process similar to branching morphogenesis and that we have used to model ﬁbrotic\n interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) and viral infection20,27,28.\n This protocol (Fig. 1a) begins by replicating early lung development through successive speciﬁ-\n cation of deﬁnitive endoderm (DE) and AFE according to protocols we established previously\n (Fig. 1b, i–iii, d4.3, d6.3)20,29,30. Subsequently, small organoids that are endowed with the expression\n patterns associated with lung buds in vivo (hence the name ‘lung bud organoids’ or LBOs, Fig. 1b,\n iv–vi, d8, d9, d15) are generated in suspension culture20. These LBOs can give rise to lung and airway\n structures after transplantation under the kidney capsule of immunodeﬁcient mice or can be\n embedded in Matrigel20, where a process similar to branching morphogenesis ensues and organoids\n arise that expand more than 6 months (Fig. 1b, vii, viii, d42, d70). Genome-wide expression analysis\n and benchmarking against the Keygenes database31, which contains tissues from the ﬁrst and second\n trimester of human gestation and of adult humans, revealed that organoids at d170 corresponded best\n to lung in the second trimester of human gestation20. At these later stages of the cultures, AT2 cells\n arise at the tips. These contain lamellar bodies (LBs) by transmission electron microscopy and can\n take up and secrete ﬂuorescently labeled surfactant protein B (SFTPB)20, features speciﬁc to AT2 cells.\n Mesenchyme appears during the anteriorization and ventralization stages and becomes scarce after\n development in Matrigel20. This may correspond to the attrition of mesenchyme during lung\n development32.\n\n2284 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JULY 2023 | 2283–2312 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n Applications of the method\n The most unique feature of the organoids described here is the presence of mesenchyme that allows\n studies of epithelial–mesenchymal interactions and therefore recapitulation and modeling of at least\n some ILDs. ILDs are a heterogeneous group of entities with diverse or unknown etiologies affecting\n the lung interstitium33. Development of pulmonary ﬁbrosis (PF), most commonly associated with\n idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis (IPF), portends the worst prognosis33,34. Injury to AT2 cells probably\n plays a critical role in the development of both familial and sporadic IPF, as mutations causing\n familial IPF speciﬁcally affect AT2 function, while depletion of AT2 cells in mouse models is asso-\n ciated with ﬁbrosis35. In addition, a fraction of patients with familial IPF have heterozygous muta-\n tions in telomerase components or other genes involved in telomere maintenance36–43. Furthermore,\n several susceptibility loci have been identiﬁed that affect telomere length44. As telomeropathy affects\n stem cell function and AT2 cells are facultative distal lung stem cells4,45, these associations suggest a\n role for AT2 cells.\n Finding therapeutic targets and novel drug treatments requires models to dissect pathogenetic\n mechanisms, identify biomarkers, discover drug targets and perform drug testing. It has been chal-\n lenging to model ILDs in animal models34,35,46–48. A complementary, more malleable, but also more\n reductionist avenue are lung organoids derived from hPSCs. We showed that PF caused by mutation\n in Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome (HPS) genes could be modeled28. HPS is a genetic syndrome caused\n by abnormal biogenesis and trafﬁcking of lysosome-related organelles and characterized by hypo-\n pigmentation, bleeding diathesis and in some but not all genotypes, PF, also known as HPS-associated\n interstitial pneumonia (HPSIP). Fibrosis in HPSIP is most probably linked to the fact that home-\n ostasis of LBs in AT2 cells is abnormal and surfactant secretion is reduced, as LBs are also lysosome-\n related organelles49. Of the nine genotypes, only three (HPS1, 2 and 4) are clinically associated with\n HPSIP. Accordingly, we found that only organoids derived from ESCs with mutation in HPS1, 2 or\n 4 showed ﬁbrotic changes, whereas organoids with a mutation in HPS8, which is clinically not\n associated with ﬁbrosis, did not28. This model therefore recapitulates the clinical incidence of PF in\n HPS. By comparing genome-wide expression data from epithelial cells isolated from lung organoids\n generated from the ﬁbrosis prone (HPS1−/− and HPS2−/−) and non-ﬁbrosis-prone (HPS8−/−)\n mutants, we furthermore identiﬁed interleukin-11 as a therapeutic target critical to ﬁbrosis. This\n provides proof-of-principle evidence that pathogenetic mechanism and therapeutic targets can be\n identiﬁed using lung organoids with mutations associated with diseases28.\n The organoids can also be used to model viral infection. They can be infected by respiratory\n viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainﬂuenza and measles. We showed that the organoids\n are authentic infection models that do not promote the emergence of culture-adapted variants in the\n propagation of parainﬂuenza27. In the case of respiratory syncytial virus, we could show that infected\n epithelial cells are dislodged into the lumen, as is observed in bronchiolitis caused by this virus49.\n The organoids can also be used for modeling human lung development. As an example, single-cell\n RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and confocal analysis is presented in the ‘Anticipated results’ section,\n showing progressive loss of other endodermal fates present early in organoid development, and\n reciprocal acquisition of a distal lung fate. This model can therefore be used to examine relevant\n signaling pathways as well as transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the progressive speciﬁcation\n of distal lung. The fact that undifferentiated endoderm remains present in organoids early in\n development suggests that it is possible that by changing the culture conditions, other endodermal\n fates could be obtained, which may constitute another potential application of this model. The\n spontaneous formation of branching structures also suggest that this model could be used to study\n branching morphogenesis in the lung.\n\n\n Comparison with other methods\n Since the ﬁrst reports on their establishment from hPSCs13,14, several publications showed the\n generation of lung organoids, either from fetal or adult lung15–18 or from hPSCs19–26. In many cases,\n the structures are limited in size or contain, often by design, speciﬁc cell types (airway23,26,50 or AT2\n cells19,24,51). The lung organoids described here present several unique features compared with others\n as a model of human distal lung development.\n\n Branching morphogenesis\n A ﬁrst feature is that they undergo a process similar to branching morphogenesis and that the full\n potential to generate lung and airways is present in the early organoids. While differentiation is biased\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JULY 2023 | 2283–2312 | www.nature.com/nprot 2285\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n toward distal lung in the conditions we use in vitro (described here in this protocol), the early-stage\n lung organoids (LBOs in suspension) generate structures containing branching tubules with prox-\n imodistal speciﬁcation when embedded in donor-derived mesenchyme after transplantation under the\n kidney capsule of immunodeﬁcient mice20. Another group (the protocol described in Miller et al.22)\n also reported generation of 3D human lung organoids from hPSCs13,14. While these smaller structures\n contained cells expressing markers of lung and airway14 and have some airway potential after sub-\n cutaneous xenografting in mice13, they did not show branching structures. However, these organoids\n were similar to our reported organoids, staged as early fetal lung22.\n\n Pulmonary mesenchyme\n Another notable feature of the distal lung organoids described here is the presence of mesenchyme,\n the origin of which is unclear. Mesenchyme could already be detected during the AFE stage of the\n protocol, remains present and relatively abundant during the LBO (suspension) stage, and becomes\n scarce, but still detectable after development to at least d60 in Matrigel20. The mesenchymal cells can\n be isolated by cell sorting for EPCAM−THY+ cells28. RNAseq20 as well as scRNAseq (see ‘Anticipated\n results’) showed that this mesenchyme expresses genes associated with pulmonary mesenchyme\n (including WTN2B52 and TBX4 (ref. 53)). The presence of mesenchyme is shared with the protocol\n of Miller et al., although they did not further characterize the mesenchyme22. The presence of\n mesenchyme in our organoids may explain what is probably the most unique application of these\n organoids, the capacity to recapitulate at least one ILDs: HPSIP. Together, these ﬁndings indicate that\n these distal lung organoids can represent an integrated model of distal lung development and disease.\n\n Differentiation efﬁciency\n A ﬁnal distinguishing feature of the organoids described here is that any intervening puriﬁcation steps\n are unnecessary. The in vitro generation of NKX2.1+ lung progenitors with high efﬁciency is a critical\n but challenging step. To resolve this issue, several groups have developed strategies based on lineage-\n speciﬁc reporters to isolate these before further differentiation and maturation. In two reports from\n the same laboratory, McCauley et al.54 speciﬁed lung progenitors, and isolated NKX2.1GFP+ cells at\n d15 for further culture in Matrigel 3D medium to yield proximal airway spheroids devoid of distal\n potential, while Jacob et al.19 resorted to a NKX2.1GFPSFTPCtdTomato reporter cell line to isolate\n NKX2.1GFP+SFTPCtdTomato+ cells for further culture in Matrigel to generate spheroids containing\n AT2 cells. While these protocols are advantageous when differentiation efﬁciency is modest, they only\n allow for studies using these speciﬁc reporter lines. To resolve this problem, surface markers were\n identiﬁed by which NKX2.1+ lung progenitors can be isolated from the cultures. Gotoh et al. reported\n carboxypeptidase M (CPM) as a speciﬁc marker of NKX2.1+ progenitors24, which was then used by\n Konishi et al.26 to select for NKX2.1+ cells. Hawkins et al. used differential expression of CD47 and\n CD26 to show that CD47hiCD26lo cells are enriched in NKX2.1+ lung progenitors55. However, a\n rigorous head-to-head comparison with reporter lines has not been performed.\n The reasons why neither reporter cells nor cell sorting are required in our protocol are unclear. We\n speculate that some differences in our protocol may offer an explanation. We grow hPSCs in the\n presence of feeders, as we have found that passage in feeder-free conditions compromises future lung\n potential. Second, although commercial kits to generate DE have been recommended and are widely\n used56, we found that, while DE generation was indeed efﬁcient, the lung potential of the DE\n generated was suboptimal. We therefore adhere to a strict protocol to generate DE using reagents that\n have to be lot tested. We also generate DE in 3D embryoid bodies, and not in two-dimensional (2D)\n cultures. Finally, the LBO suspension culture step may select for cells speciﬁed to pulmonary epi-\n thelium and mesenchyme. The same may be true for the Matrigel step. Indeed, scRNAseq analysis\n suggests progressive acquisition of a distal lung at the expense of other endodermal fates over the ﬁrst\n 80 d of the protocol (see ‘Anticipated results’).\n\n A serum-free model\n The published protocol that is the most closely related to the protocol described here was by Miller et al.22.\n However, the factors used in the latter differ from ours. In the speciﬁcation of AFE they also use, in\n addition to BMP and TGF-β inhibition, Wnt agonism, FGF4 and Smoothened agonist. They do not\n include an extended period of suspension culture (which in the protocol described here generates\n LBOs). Furthermore, and importantly, they use fetal bovine serum (FBS) in their base medium, which\n we try to avoid as this is an uncharacterized reagent. Miller et al. do obtain proximal and some distal\n lung speciﬁcation in the presence of serum, and in conditions similar to ours (but without BMP4 and\n\n2286 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JULY 2023 | 2283–2312 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n d0 d1 d5 d14\n\n\n Fig. 2 | FBS-containing media does not maintain organoid cultures.

The organoids we describe here do not\n develop in the presence of serum (Fig. 2).\n\n Development and disease modeling\n As mentioned before, the organoids of Miller et al. are much smaller and do not show branching.\n Commonalities between both types of organoids are the capacity to generate lung and airway\n structures after transplantation under the kidney capsule of immunodeﬁcient mice, the presence of\n mesenchyme and the fact that repeated enrichment steps are not required. In contrast to the current\n protocol, that of Miller et al. has not been reported to be useful in modeling ILDs, and was not\n reported to be infectable by the viruses we used20,27. Both models will probably serve complementary\n goals. The capacity to generate airway cells in the protocol of Miller et al., for example, may allow\n studies on airway development and proximodistal speciﬁcation, whereas the organoids reported here\n will allow investigation of branching morphogenesis and alveolar speciﬁcation, in addition to\n modeling ILDs.\n We have also previously reported on a protocol in Collagen I (Col I) gels that allows further\n maturation of lung cells in 3D21,57. This Col I protocol and the resulting organoids are distinct\n from the protocol described here. Rather than generating 3D LBOs in suspension culture, the Col I\n protocol continues lung progenitor speciﬁcation in 2D, followed by plating into Col I gels. The\n Col I model is, in contrast to the organoids described here, permissive for the speciﬁcation of all distal\n and airway lineages after retraction of CHIR99021 (CHIR), including cells compatible with AT1 cells.\n This ﬁnding is consistent with the observations of Kanagaki et al. in ﬁbroblast-dependent alveolar\n organoids58. However, retraction of CHIR in the distal lung organoids described here results in cell\n death and disintegration. In vitro, we were therefore not able to achieve induction of AT1 markers in\n lung organoids generated using the protocol described here. However, we do note that after trans-\n plantation under the kidney capsule, LBOs could generate cells expressing AT1 markers20, suggesting\n that the potential exists, but that the correct in vitro conditions for AT1 generation have not yet been\n identiﬁed for these organoids.\n In addition, while in most studies the maturity of the generated cells goes unreported or is\n equivalent to the second trimester of human gestation21, the cells generated by our Col I protocol\n exhibit transcriptomic proﬁles, ultrastructure and an array of lineage-speciﬁc markers that also\n partially match postnatal lungs21. Several mature cell types can be isolated using surface markers.\n Most notably, the Col I protocol allowed the generation NGFR+ basal cells, the stem cells of the\n postnatal airway59, which can be isolated and further expanded using established techniques60. On\n the other hand, and in contrast to the model described here, modeling ﬁbrotic lung disease was not\n possible, and mesenchymal cells were not present. Both models are therefore complementary. The\n reason why both protocols behave differently is most likely linked to differences in the early stages of\n directed differentiation and the different extracellular matrices used to embed the organoids. The\n underlying mechanisms merit further investigation.\n\n Limitations\n Even after 6 months of culture in Matrigel, the organoid model matches the second trimester of\n human gestation on the basis of genome-wide expression analysis. The expression of SFTPC, a\n marker of mature AT2 cells occurs late in the culture (d170) and is not universal (Fig. 3a), although\n all other AT2 markers studied (SFTPB, ABCA3, LPCAT, NAPSA, SLC34A2) reproducibly and pro-\n gressively increase and are consistently expressed by a majority of the cells by d80 (see ‘Anticipated\n results’). We have previously shown the presence of LBs and capacity to take up and release SFTPB in\n organoids >d120 old, indicating long-term maintenance of still immature AT2 cells20.

The upper\nrow shows organoids that we prefer not to pick due to the dense center and hollowing structures. The lower row shows ‘good’ organoids with folding\nepithelial structures and clear and transparent center.\n\n\n combination of CHIR, FGF7 and dexamethasone, cAMP and IBMX has been reported to be necessary\n for the expansion and maintenance of so-called alveolospheres generated from hPSC-derived lung\n progenitors. Even here, however, maintaining SFTPC expression was challenging and required\n repeated sorting for a reporter, as well switching the culture conditions between presence and absence\n of CHIR19,56. We also note that in the organoid protocol of Miller et al.22, SFTPC expression was rare.\n Even though we observed a process reminiscent of branching morphogenesis, the branching is not\n well organized. The structures branch randomly in every direction and appeared disorganized,\n probably because neither directional cues nor physical constraints, such as a thoracic cavity, are\n provided. In addition, the exact nature and patterning of the mesenchyme present is unclear and the\n proportion declines along the culture time. The mesenchyme does not have the potential to generate\n endothelial cells in vivo after transplantation under the kidney capsule, although smooth muscle and\n occasional cartilage were present20. Endothelial cells or blood vessels have also not been observed\n in vitro in our model. Furthermore, we could not achieve induction of AT1 markers in vitro, although\n AT1 markers were observed after engraftment in vivo20. Terminal and architecturally fully appro-\n priate maturation of organoids is still a challenge for the ﬁeld in general. Finally, the use of Matrigel to\n embed LBOs and serum to inactive enzymatic activities in this model is still a barrier for translational\n research. The use of Matrigel might be replaced with synthetic hydrogels. However, when LBOs,\n generated using the protocol described here, were embedded in Col I gels, they did not show\n branching (Fig. 4). We do not know whether this is due to the molecular composition or the stiffness\n of Matrigel that allows branching morphogenesis of LBOs. Hence, the choice of 3D medium for\n embedding should take these two factors into consideration. The use of serum to inactivate enzymes\n in the protocol can be easily substituted with puriﬁed protease inhibitors.\n\n2288 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JULY 2023 | 2283–2312 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n\n\n Fig. 4 | Morphology of lung organoids embedded in Col I gel.

Scale bar, 1 mm.\n\n\n Experimental design\n A schematic of the protocol with examples of the typical morphologies at each stage is shown in Fig. 1.\n We maintain hPSCs on feeder cells. The protocol begins with mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast (MEF)\n depletion (d1, Fig. 1b, i) followed by a stepwise, sequential induction of DE (d0–4, Fig. 1b, ii) and AFE\n (d5–6, Fig. 1b, iii) as previously described20,61. hPSCs are passaged on Matrigel-coated plates to\n deplete residual MEFs for ~24 h (Steps 1–13). After MEF depletion, primitive streak and embryoid\n body induction is performed in embryoid bodies/primitive streak (EB/PS) medium in ultralow-\n attachment plates for 12–16 h (Steps 14–27). This is followed by switching to DE induction medium\n for another 76–80 h (d4; Steps 28–42). Essential in this step is exposure to high concentrations of\n Activin A. DE can be generated both in 2D adherent cultures and or in 3D as EBs in low-attachment\n plates. We found that lung potential is maintained the best in EBs. DE purity is veriﬁed by ﬂow\n cytometry after staining for EPCAM, cKIT and CXCR4 (Steps 43–66)20,61. It is essential that more\n than 90% of the cells express high levels of these three markers. Others have recommended the use of\n commercial kits to generate DE56. We found that while generation of DE was efﬁcient, the potential\n of these DE cells to generate lung and airway cells was more limited.\n High-purity DE (>90%) is directed to AFE via inhibition of TGF-β, BMP and WNT signaling by\n SB 431542, NOGGIN and IWP2, respectively (Steps 67–89)29,30,61. At the end of AFE induction (d6),\n cells are treated with ventralization medium in the presence of BMP4, FGF10, FGF7, all-trans retinoic\n acid (RA) and the glycogen synthase kinase 3β antagonist, CHIR for 48 h (Steps 90–92). At this time,\n formation of loosely adherent clumps can be observed (Fig. 1b, iv). Next, LBOs are generated\n (Steps 93–99). This is accomplished by resuspending clumps of cells at d8 and maintaining those in\n ultra-low-attachment plates in the presence of CHIR, FGF10, FGF7, BMP4 and RA, where they will\n form spheres consisting of folding epithelial sheets interspersed with mesenchymal cells (Fig. 1b, v, vi\n and Fig. 3b). The majority of the epithelial cells will express early, but not mature lung markers, and\n have an expression proﬁle consistent with lung bud epithelium. The mesenchymal cells express\n markers consistent with pulmonary mesenchyme, and can make up 5–20% of the population by ﬂow\n cytometry20.\n In the ﬁnal stage (Steps 100–117), the LBOs are plated in Matrigel with CHIR, FGF10, FGF7,\n BMP4 and RA, where they undergo outward budding followed by a process similar to branching\n morphogenesis (Fig. 1b, vii, viii).

Invert it and gently peel off the membrane from the insert using forceps.\n 2 Excise the lung organoid and embed in a cryo-mold on dry ice.\n 3 Cut frozen samples on a cryotome at the thickness of 10–12 μm and collect on adhesion microscope slides and air dry.\n 4 Fix the samples in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, wash two times for 5 min in 50 mM glycine to inactivate the PFA, followed by washing\n in PBS.\n 5 Permeabilize samples for 10 min in 0.2% PBST (PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100) and block by incubating in PBS containing 5% donkey serum for 1 h,\n then incubate overnight in primary antibody in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% donkey serum (for primary antibodies and suggested dilutions, see\n Table 1).\n 6 The next day, wash the samples three times in PBS and 1% donkey serum and incubate with secondary antibody (1:200) for 1 h at the room\n temperature (for secondary antibodies, see Table 1). Stain nuclei with DAPI (1:500).\n 7 Mount sections with Mounting Reagent and coverslip. Slides are ready for the imaging when the mounting reagent dries properly.\n\n\n which in our hands gave similar results. We recommend growth factor-reduced Matrigel, as multiple\n factors at various concentrations may otherwise be present that could unpredictably affect organoid\n development, and therefore reproducibility. The mesenchyme is gradually lost after embedding in\n Matrigel. Approximately 90% of LBOs will yield rapidly expanding branching structures in which the\n fraction cells expressing a constellation of AT2 markers gradually increases, such that by d80, these\n form the majority of the cells (see ‘Anticipated results’). The organoids can be maintained in culture\n for more than 6 months. The entire protocol is conducted serum-free conditions.\n We found that several medium constituents need to be lot tested. These include Activin A, N2 and\n B27 medium, and Knockout Serum Replacement (see ‘Reagents’). Lot testing involves comparative\n analysis for maximal efﬁciency of DE generation as evaluated by expression of EPCAM, cKIT and\n CXCR4 by ﬂow cytometry. We found lot testing of Matrigel for organoid formation not necessary.\n The cultures can be analyzed at any step of the differentiation using several approaches, including\n immunoﬂuorescence (IF; Box 1), reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction\n (RT–qPCR; Box 1), electron microscopy, RNAseq and western blot, as we published previously20,27,28.\n We provide an example of IF (Fig. 5, antibodies in Table 1) and RT–qPCR analysis (Fig. 6, primer\n sequences in Table 2). Additionally, the cultures can be analyzed by scRNAseq (Boxes 2 and 3). As\n the quality of the input single-cell suspension is critical to scRNAseq, we provide a protocol to\n generate single-cell suspension from organoids in Matrigel (Box 2). In the ‘Anticipated results’\n section, we provide an example of scRNAseq analysis (Figs. 7 and 8).\n\n\n Expertise needed to implement the protocol\n Any scientist with experience in cell culture can apply this protocol. The required equipment, except\n for the low-oxygen incubator and the picking hood, is standard to most cell culture facilities, and\n reagents can be purchased from standard scientiﬁc vendors.\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JULY 2023 | 2283–2312 | www.nature.com/nprot 2291\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n a d8 DAPI DAPI c d60 DAPI 1\n DAPI\n SOX2 FOXA1 NKX2.1 NKX2.1\n CDX2 ZEB1 EPCAM EPCAM\n\n\n 500 µm 500 µm 100 µm\n\n 1\n 2\n b d20 ZEB1 d20 DAPI DAPI\n EPCAM NKX2.1 NKX2.1\n EPCAM EPCAM\n 2\n\n\n 500 µm 500 µm 500 µm 100 µm\n\n\n 1 DAPI 1 Ki67 e d60 DAPI 1 DAPI\n d d60 Ki67 cCASP3 cCASP3\n FOXA1\n FOXA1 2\n EPCAM\n\n\n 250 μm 1 100 µm\n 2\n 2 Ki67 2 DAPI\n FOXA1 cCASP3\n\n\n 500 µm 200 µm 500 µm 100 µm\n\n\nFig. 5 | IF analysis of organoids at different stages. a, Tile scan image at d8 (ventralization) stained for indicated markers. b, Tile scan images and\nhigher magniﬁcation ﬁelds (insets) of culture LBOs at d20 of the culture protocol. c–e, Confocal tile scans of ~d60 organoids stained for the indicated\nmarkers, and higher magniﬁcation images (right) corresponding to numbered boxes.

This optimization is primarily geared at optimal DE induction as\n evaluated by ﬂow cytometry for expression of EPCAM, CXCR4 and cKIT (see Steps 28–66) and may\n require adjusting density of hPSCs and feeders, as well as duration of DE induction (typically ranging\n from 72 to 96 h) !

Time varies from ~45 min to 1 h depending on Matrigel thickness.\n 7 Centrifuge at 200g for 5 min.\n 8 Aspirate the wash medium and cell recovery reagent and add 1 ml of Accutase to the organoid and incubate at 37 °C.\n CRITICAL STEP Avoid using trypsin to dissociate the organoid as it is too harsh and the chances of losing fragile cell types is higher.\n c\n\n\n 9 Gently shake the tube to disturb/dissociate the organoid every 5 min and replace the tube at 37 °C for 10–12 min. Time varies depending on the\n organoid size and density.\n 10 When the organoid is dissociated add 10 ml wash medium and centrifuge at 400g for 4 min.\n 11 Aspirate the wash medium and resuspend the pellet in base medium.\n CRITICAL STEP Check the base medium compatibility with the sequencing technology to be used for scRNAseq.\n c\n\n\n 12 Remove dead cells from the cell suspension by using the MiltenyiBiotec dead cell removal kit.\n 13 Dilute the cell suspension to a concentration of 5,000 cells/μl for sequencing.

Sequencing libraries were prepared using 10x Genomics Single Cell\n Gene Expression 3′ workﬂow and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. FASTQ ﬁles were processed using cell ranger version 5.0.1 for each\n sample and the reads were aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome.\n Data were analyzed using the standardized Seurat pipeline V4 in R65 and reciprocal principal component analysis-based integration (https://satija\n lab.org/seurat/articles/integration_rpca.html). The steps involved in the analysis include: quality control analysis, normalization, integration of\n samples, dimensionality reduction, clustering and visualization of the data65. To begin, the Cell Ranger output count matrix was read into R and a\n Seurat object was created for each individual dataset. The four datasets were merged into one dataset and ﬁltered on the basis of the number of\n unique molecular identiﬁers (nUMI ≥500), number of genes (nGenes ≥250) and mitochondrial abundance (<20%) for further analysis. Following\n ﬁltering, the datasets were split and to account for batch effects, sequencing depth and to remove technical variability, normalization and variance\n stabilization was performed using the SCTransform (SCT) function in Seurat66. Cell cycle scoring and mitochondrial abundance was calculated and\n regressed out along with the normalization process using SCTransform.\n Integration is based identiﬁcation of common features in different datasets that serves as anchors across these datasets, such that batch effects\n are attenuated65. Merged analysis uses the processed data, but does correct those based on common anchors, and therefore does not correct for\n batch effects. However, as integration may be prone to overcorrection if differences in cellular composition between samples are large67, as may be\n these case in the organoids described here at different time points, we present both integrated (Fig. 7) and merged (Fig. 8) analyses. Features to\n use when integrating the datasets were chosen using SelectIntegrationFeatures function. Principal component analysis for each dataset was done\n individually before identifying integration anchors. We then set the normalization method to ‘SCT’ and the reduction to robust principal component\n analysis while using the FindIntegrationAnchors function. The datasets were integrated using the integration anchors identiﬁed using IntegrateData\n function. Principal component analysis was used to identify the number of dimensions (nDims) for dimensionality reduction of the integrated\n dataset and visualization was performed using RunPCA. nDims was used to compute the shared nearest neighbor graphs using the k-nearest\n neighbor algorithm, to ﬁnd relevant clusters and UMAP for visualization of the clusters was performed using RunUMAP function. Clusters were\n created with resolutions ranging from 0.4 to 0.8. We visualized and analyzed the different clusters on the basis of marker identiﬁcation using\n FeaturePlot and found 0.4 resolution to produce the most biologically informative clusters for our study. We performed pseudotime analysis using\n scVelo63 on the merged datasets.\n\n\n Stop medium\n Make 500 ml Stop medium by combining reagents as detailed in the table below.

Add 2 ml ﬁbro-\n nectin/DPBS solution to each well and incubate the plates in a normoxic incubator for at least 30 min or\n 4 °C overnight. Make sure the ﬁbronectin coating covers the entire plate (~12 ml of a six-well plate).",

Alternatively, CXCR4 microbeads can be used\n to enrich the endodermal population on d4.

These\n need to be batch-tested for DE induction using a line\n that reliably generates DE\n Inadequate hPSC maintenance DE is the most problematic germ layer to generate.\n Verify pluripotency of hPSCs by staining for OCT4 and\n SOX2 (~100% of the cells should be positive). Even if\n the cells express proper pluripotency markers, the\n optimal density matters. We typically plate RUES2 cells\n at a density of 7,000–9,000 cells/cm2 and hiPSCs at\n 10,000-15,000 cells/cm2. If excessive cell death is\n observed, 10 μM Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor) to hPSC\n maintenance media for the ﬁrst 24 h following plating\n can be tried. MEFs for hPSC maintenance are plated at a\n density of 17,000–23,000 cells/cm2. However, optimal\n density can vary from batch to batch and needs to be\n tested using DE induction as the end point\n Table continued\n\n\n2306 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JULY 2023 | 2283–2312 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n Table 3 (continued)\n Step Problem Possible reason Solution\n\n 83–99 Inefﬁcient or abnormal LBO Defective DE See Troubleshooting for Step 66 above\n formation.

In addition\n to defective DE, this can be caused by the cell density in\n Step 83. The optimal seeding density for this step is\n 7.5 × 105 cells per well (Fig. 9a, left). If the initial cell\n seeding density is lower than 7.5 × 105 cells per well,\n smaller and fewer organoids will be observed on d8.\n These small organoids tend to become hollow spheres\n faster in culture. If the culture is initiated with many\n more than 7.5 × 105 cells per well, organoid formation\n might be less obvious on d8. In this case, the organoids\n can still be resuspended and proceed to Ventralization\n and LBO formation (Fig. 9a, right). These densities may\n have to be adjusted for different hPSCs lines\n Small LBOs at d10 (Step 99) Organoids might be small on d10. If they do not sink to\n the bottom, add 1 ml of fresh media directly to the well\n and wait for two more days before replacing the media\n Exhaustion of the culture media LBOs are highly proliferative between d8 and d20\n (Fig. 9b and Supplementary Fig. 1).

When culturing organoids in suspension for\n too long, they will become hollow spheroids and\n eventually burst and reform smaller cell clumps\n (Fig. 9c). These small cell clumps will not generate\n branching organoids\n Picking of LBOs Although no clear correlation could be found between LBO\n morphology and subsequent quality of Matrigel organoid\n generation, it is best to avoid picking very dense LBOs that\n lack the folding structures, or LBOs with cysts\n Rapid polymerization of Matrigel We suggest embedding organoids one insert at a time\n to avoid Matrigel solidiﬁcation in U-bottom 96-well\n plate before transferring to 24-well inserts\n (Steps 107–112)\n Exhaustion of the culture media With multiple organoids in one insert, more\n ventralization media/branching media can be fed to\n each insert, especially in later-stage organoid cultures\n\n\nAnticipated results\n Brightﬁeld images of the sequential stages of differentiation are shown in Fig. 1b. Using this dif-\n ferentiation protocol, self-organizing cell clumps will form in 2 d after switching to the ventralization\n medium/branching medium (Fig. 1b, iv). Some of the organoids will detach from the monolayer but\n most of them will remain loosely attached to the plate. The number of organoids formed in each well\n varies from hundreds to thousands. The cell clumps might look damaged right after suspension, but\n they will self-organize/repair themselves the next day. Cell clumps appear homogeneous at the\n beginning and folding structures (Fig. 1b, v) will appear 2–3 d after suspension. Folding structures\n will become more complex with time (Fig. 1b, vi). Budding of organoids happens within 1 week after\n embedding in Matrigel and obvious branching can be observed after 2–3 weeks (Fig. 1b, vii). For-\n mation of self-organizing cell clumps might not be obvious in some iPS lines. However, they will form\n self-organizing cell clumps after suspension and branch out after embedding in Matrigel. These\n organoids can be maintained for more than 6 months and will ﬁll the entire well they are cultured in.\n Organoids can be analyzed using standard approaches, including RT–qPCR (Box 1), IF (Box 1),\n ﬂow cytometry and RNAseq as published20, as well as scRNAseq (Boxes 2 and 3).

We prefer to benchmark development by morphology and IF, as published20,28\n rather than mRNA expression by RT–qPCR or bulk RNAseq. mRNA determination typically uses a\n baseline control and reports fold changes compared with this control. In the developmental trajectory\n of the organoids, these would be LBOs or hPSCs. However, the latter do not express mature dif-\n ferentiation markers, leading to large and highly variable fold changes. For example, Fig. 3a shows the\n mRNA fold changes of ABCA3 and surfactant genes when comparing more mature organoids (d170)\n with immature organoids (d15 and d25)20. Since immature organoids do not express or express very\n little mature markers, the fold changes of these markers are high and very variable due to the\n inﬁnitesimally small denominator.\n Examples of IF studies and anticipated results at consecutive stages, using d20 and d60 as\n representative examples, are shown in Fig. 5. During the AFE stage, cells grow in islands containing\n mostly SOX2+ cells, although clusters of cells expressing the hindgut markers CDX2+ are present\n within these islands (Fig. 5a, d8, left). The islands of epithelial cells are interspersed with ZEB1+\n mesenchymal cells (Fig. 5a, d8, right). In the suspension stage at d20, LBOs consist of folding and\n invaginating epithelial cells surrounded by mesenchymal cells (ZEB1+), while large sections of most\n\n2308 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JULY 2023 | 2283–2312 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n LBOs express NKX2.1 (Fig. 5b, d20). After development in Matrigel, NKX2.1 and EPCAM are\n expressed in the entire periphery of the organoids from ~d40 on (Fig. 5c), indicating nearly full\n commitment to the lung lineage. We also discovered at this stage (images shown are d60) small\n hollow tubular structures in the dense centers of the organoids that expressed EPCAM but not\n NKX2.1 (Fig. 5c). These cells express FOXA1 indicating that they are endodermal (Fig. 5d). Most\n proliferating cells, as detected by staining for Ki67 are in the periphery (Fig. 5d, inset 1), although rare\n proliferating cells were also observed in the central endodermal tubules (Fig. 5d, inset 2, arrow).\n Surrounding these structures in the center are cells, identiﬁed by the presence of 4′,6-diamidino-\n 2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Fig. 5e), that did not stain with any lung or airway markers, or with\n mesenchymal markers (CD90, ZEB1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB) (not shown). However, staining for\n cleaved CASPASE3 (cCASP3) reveals that, whereas apoptotic cells are rare to absent in the tips\n (Fig. 5e, inset 1), the cells in the center outside the tubules were largely apoptotic (Fig. 5e, inset 2).\n These may be remnants of the mesenchymal cells present in the LBOs.\n As scRNAseq is now a standard analysis method, we provide scRNAseq data of 25-, 40-, 60- and\n 80-d-old organoids that conﬁrm the IF data, and also provide a more granular view of differentiation.\n This analysis revealed ten clusters (Fig. 7a), with, as expected, a progressive gain of distal lung markers\n and disappearance of mesenchymal and other endodermal markers (Fig. 7b). While many clusters\n could not be assigned to speciﬁc cell types and probably represent transitional states, as is to be\n expected in differentiating, fetal-stage organoids, some clusters could be identiﬁed (Fig. 7c). Cluster 8\n consisted of only proliferating cells. However, we note that Ki67+ cells were also present throughout,\n and their frequency decreased over time. All clusters except cluster 9 expressed FOXA1 (Fig. 7c) and\n EPCAM (not shown), and are therefore endodermal, consistent with our published IF studies. Cluster\n 9 are mesenchymal cells whose abundance and proliferation (as evaluated by Ki67 expression) declines\n over time, again consistent with our previously published studies using ﬂow cytometry20. These\n expressed, in addition to classical mesenchymal markers such as THY1, ACTA2, ZEB1 and COL1A2,\n also TBX4 and WNT2B. TBX4 is expressed in pulmonary mesenchyme53, whereas WNT2B is\n expressed in the endoderm surrounding ventral AFE and essential for induction of a pulmonary fate in\n this area52. The mesenchyme is therefore consistent with pulmonary or anterior foregut mesenchyme.\n We identiﬁed mesenchyme expressing these markers previously in RNAseq studies of LBOs20. The\n lung marker NKX2.1 (also known as TTF1) and the lung progenitor marker, CPM24, are ﬁrst only\n observed in clusters 0 and 1, and then progressively spread to the other clusters such that at d80 the\n organoids are entirely NKX2.1+CPM+. The widespread expression of NKX2.1 conﬁrms our IF studies\n (Fig. 5c and ref. 20). Furthermore, at d60 and d80, progressive induction of the distal, predominantly\n AT2-associated markers (NAPSA, SFTPB, SFTA3, LPCAT1, ABCA3) is observed (Fig. 7c). Low levels\n of expression of these markers are already evident in cluster 1 at d40 as well (Fig. 7c). However, no\n SFTPC was detected, consistent with the fact that full AT2 maturation occurs late in the development\n of the organoids and is highly variable20, indicative of slowly progressive development. This is con-\n sistent with the reanalysis of our published RNAseq data in Fig. 3a, where even at d170 expression of\n SFTPC was not present in all organoids, and was lower than that of the other surfactant proteins and\n of ABCA3 (ref. 20). We note that cells in cluster 1 also expressed the club cell marker, SCGB3A2, at d25,\n with expression becoming more diffuse later on. We previously identiﬁed small populations of\n SCGB3A2 in the organoids by IF20. It is possible that the SCGB3A2+ cells are precursors of the recently\n identiﬁed SCGB3A2+ cells in the most distal airways that may function as transitional intermediates\n between AT1 and AT2 cells6–8. Basal cells, deﬁned by expression of p63 and NGFR and mucin-\n producing cells were not detected (not shown). When a merged (as opposed to integrated)62 analysis of\n the data was performed, each timepoint formed a separate major cluster, at least in part due to batch\n effects. Nevertheless, the decrease in endodermal markers and the increase in distal markers with time\n was evident (Fig. 8). scVelo trajectory analysis63 at each timepoint indicated trajectories that ended in\n the population expressing distal lung markers (NAPSA, SFTPB, SFTA3, LPCAT1, ABCA3) (Fig. 8b).\n Taken together, the data show progressive acquisition of a distal lung at the expense of alternative\n endodermal fates and attrition of mesoderm throughout the development of the organoids.\n In alveolospheres, stomach and intestinal markers were identiﬁed by scRNAseq56. Furthermore,\n from our own previous analysis of RNAseq data, a variable and modest match with human intestine\n was observed20. These data suggest that other endodermal cells may be present during directed\n differentiation into lung. We therefore veriﬁed the scRNAseq data from the organoids for such\n markers. Indeed, the small clusters 4 and 5 expressed mid- and hindgut markers, such as CDX2 and\n GATA4 (ref. 64), the expression of which progressively wanes at later stages. However, intestinal and\n stomach markers could not be detected by IF. To verify whether the NKX2.1−FOXA1+ cells in the\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JULY 2023 | 2283–2312 | www.nature.com/nprot 2309\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n centers of the organoids might expressed other endodermal RNAs but not protein, we punched out\n the centers of the organoids with a 1,000 μl pipette tip and compared the expression of select\n endodermal genes in centers and tips by RT–qPCR (Fig. 6). The centers of the organoids were indeed\n consistently enriched for mRNAs encoding endodermal markers such as CDX2 (midgut and hindgut)\n and PDX1 (pancreas), whereas some other markers, such as MUC13 and GATA4 (stomach) were\n more variably enriched. Small populations of cells with other endodermal potentials may therefore be\n present in the centers of the organoids, at least initially.\n\n\n Reporting summary\n Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary\n linked to this article.",
