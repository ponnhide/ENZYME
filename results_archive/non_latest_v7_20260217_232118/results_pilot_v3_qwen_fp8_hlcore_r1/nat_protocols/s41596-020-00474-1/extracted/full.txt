 Organoid technology has revolutionized the study of human organ development, disease and therapy response tailored to
 the individual. Although detailed protocols are available for the generation and long-term propagation of human organoids
 from various organs, such methods are lacking for breast tissue. Here we provide an optimized, highly versatile protocol
 for long-term culture of organoids derived from either normal human breast tissues or breast cancer (BC) tissues, as well
 as culturing conditions for a panel of 45 biobanked samples, including BC organoids covering all major disease subtypes
 (triple-negative, estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth receptor
1234567890():,;
1234567890():,;


 2-positive). Additionally, we provide methods for genetic manipulation by Lipofectamine 2000, electroporation or
 lentivirus and subsequent organoid selection and clonal culture. Finally, we introduce an optimized method for orthotopic
 organoid transplantation in mice, which includes injection of organoids and estrogen pellets without the need for surgery.
 Organoid derivation from tissue fragments until the ﬁrst split takes 7–21 d; generation of genetically manipulated clonal
 organoid cultures takes 14–21 d; and organoid expansion for xenotransplantation takes >4 weeks.


 Introduction
 BC remains the most widely diagnosed and second deadliest malignancy in women1. BC comprises
 multiple subtypes that arise through the sequential accumulation of mutations in resident epithelial
 cells and result in tumors with complex genomic and biological heterogeneity2–4. Standard ther-
 apeutic approaches are currently based on clinical and pathologic features, complemented by the
 expression status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth
 factor receptor 2 (HER2)5 and are, thereby, inadequately tailored to individual patients. An extensive
 understanding of the processes underlying normal breast development, carcinogenesis and disease
 progression is necessary to devise novel personalized therapies, but this is hampered by a lack of
 suitable and widely available in vitro models. Organoid technology—the long-term propagation of
 human adult stem cells in three-dimensional (3D) cultures6—has provided unprecedented and
 transformative ways to study healthy organ development and tumorigenesis in vitro. Here we
 describe optimized protocols for human normal breast and BC organoids to model breast develop-
 ment and cancer.
 The described methods have been used to generate a biobank of BC organoids that typically
 recapitulated the original patient tumor in terms of histopathology, hormone receptor expression and
 HER2 status, as well as copy number variations and sequence changes, thereby capturing the full
 heterogeneity of BC (www.huborganoids.nl)7. Furthermore, normal organoid cultures contain basal/
 stem cells, luminal progenitors and mature luminal cells, thus preserving complex epithelial lineages8,

 discuss three different ways to genetically manipulate organoids and how to select and grow clonal
 organoids. Finally, we describe xenotransplantation of BC organoids.
 We provide information on morphology, growth rate and passaging conditions for 45 organoid
 cultures encompassing normal, primary tumor and metastatic cultures as a reference guide for
 organoid maintenance, taking into account inter-culture variation (Table 1). Establishing a breast
 organoid culture, from tissue isolation until the ﬁrst passage, will take 7–21 d. Genetically manip-
 ulating an organoid culture and generating a selected clonal line at passage 1 will take 14–21 d.
 Expanding an organoid culture for transplantation usually requires more than 4 weeks and depends
 on the number of mice injected, as well as the organoid proliferation rate. To establish, maintain and
 manipulate breast organoids, expertise in 3D (organoid) culturing is useful but not essential. For
 in vivo work, appropriate facilities and expertise in mouse handling and maintenance are required.

 Applications
 We anticipate that preclinical researchers in the BC ﬁeld can use this protocol in a tailor-made
 fashion, by combining parts suited to their speciﬁc research needs. Normal organoids provide a
 valuable resource for studying development and function of the human mammary gland8. For
 understanding de novo oncogenesis, normal breast organoids can be subjected to CRISPR–Cas9
 editing to efﬁciently knock out tumor suppressor genes9, or organoids from individuals with a
 hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome, such as BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, can be used. Addi-
 tionally, organoids can be used to assess the efﬁcacy of novel drugs, both in vitro as well as upon
 engraftment in vivo. These organoid xenograft models can also be used to visualize tumor growth and
 cancer cell behavior in vivo through the introduction of a mammary imaging window10. Importantly,
 due to the retained genetic and histologic features of the original patient tumor7, BC organoids can be
 used as a clinical tool to aid personalized medicine, by assessing drug responses in a patient-speciﬁc
 manner. Although the methods described have been optimized for breast organoids, the sections on
 genetic manipulation and clonal selection can be applied to a wide variety of organoid cultures with
 minor adjustments, thus affecting a wide research ﬁeld beyond BC.

 Comparison with other methods and possible limitations
 In comparison to commonly used BC cell lines11 or BC spheroids12, BC organoids can be grown long
 term, while recapitulating the complex genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity7 that is characteristic of
 BC13,14. Although several groups have reported 3D model systems for studying normal mammary
 development15,16, these do not allow the extended culture of all mammary lineages, in contrast to the
 normal breast organoids reported here8. Different from previously developed methods to generate
 patient-derived xenografts17, the injection-based method for estrogen pellet implantation and BC
 organoid xenotransplantation used here circumvents the need for complex surgical procedures. As
 compared to growth properties of human intestinal organoids, which can be passaged 1:6 every week
 with limited variation among samples6, the proliferation rate of breast organoids is relatively slow and
 can differ substantially between donors. The splitting ratio can vary from 1:6 weekly to 1:2 weekly,
 biweekly or even less frequently (Table 1). It should be noted that maintenance of 3D breast organoid
 cultures is relatively laborious and costly compared to most other in vitro breast cultures.

 Experimental design
 Expansion medium (reagent setup)
 We describe the preparation of an expansion medium that was previously published7 (referred to as
 ‘Type 1’; Table 2). In addition, we introduce an alternative expansion medium, similar to that
 developed for long-term ovarian cancer organoid cultures18 (referred to as ‘Type 2’; Table 2), which
 can improve the growth properties of some organoid cultures (Fig. 2a and Table 1). We advise to
 grow newly established organoid cultures in both Type 1 and Type 2 expansion medium, to deﬁne the
 most optimal medium type per donor. We use homemade R-spondin-1, Noggin and Wnt3a con-
 ditioned media, for which detailed production protocols are available19–22. We strongly recommend
 using these homemade conditioned media, as we experienced superior performance compared to
 commercial compounds. However, we do provide commercial alternatives in the ‘Reagents’ section.

 Organoid derivation (Steps 1–40)
 We describe the establishment of an organoid culture, as previously published7. Patient resection
 material is cut into small pieces, washed thoroughly and digested with collagenase. After additional

 washing and ﬁltration, the digested tissue is plated in basement membrane extract (BME) and
 supplemented with expansion medium (Fig. 2b,c). BME, a gel-like substance that polymerizes at
 temperatures above 10 °C, is used to mimic the extracellular matrix and provide support for 3D
 organoids (Fig. 2d,e). Matrigel can be used as an alternative for BME with similar performance
 (Fig. 2f; see ‘Reagents’ section). Organoid derivation is optimal for tissues that contain a minimal
 amount of fat and necrotic tissue. The desired epithelial tissue for organoid generation usually
 appears as ﬁrm, pink-to-brownish tissue, whereas necrotic tissue is usually softer and darker. Fat
 tissue is soft and white to yellow and can be easily scraped or cut off.


 Organoid maintenance (Steps 41–48)
 The split ratio, passage interval and method of organoid dissociation differ considerably among
 donors and should be optimized for each newly established organoid culture (Table 1). Organoids can
 be passaged 7–21 d after organoid establishment (Steps 1–40) or after the previous split at a 1:2–1:8
 ratio. Refer to Table 1 for a guideline. The time of passage and split ratio should be optimized for each
 newly established organoid culture based on conﬂuency. The best moment to passage is just before
 organoids in the center of the BME drop start dying, characterized by shedding of debris or a darker
 appearance, or when organoids reach a diameter larger than 300 μm (further referred to as a
 ‘conﬂuent well’). We describe both single-cell organoid passaging by trypsinization (Step 43A; Fig. 2g)
 and passaging via organoid fragments by mechanical disruption, referred to as shearing (Step 43B;
 Fig. 2g). The preferred way of passaging for most organoid cultures is via fragments rather than single
 cells (Table 1), because single cells are slower at growing into new organoids and have a higher chance
 of dying compared to fragments. Both methods can be tried for newly established cultures, especially
 for fast-growing cultures. In some occasions, for instance when cell counts are critical, single-cell
 passaging should be used. If you want to generate clonal organoid cultures after transfection, we
 recommend using an organoid culture that allows passaging via single cells. Using single cells, as
 opposed to fragments, will increase the likelihood that the organoids growing out after selection
 (e.g., by puromycin) indeed originate from single cells and are, thus, clonal.
 We also provide guidelines for culturing at appropriate organoid densities and describe how to
 minimize cell death and recognize a conﬂuent well of organoids (Step 49–53; Fig. 2h–j). Additionally,
 we describe procedures and conditions for long-term storage (Steps 54–57) and recovery after
 cryopreservation (Steps 58–64). We recommend cryopreserving at least six cryovials for each newly
 established organoid culture at an early passage (< passage 5).

 lentiviral infection for stable DNA transduction (Step 65C; used for Fig. 1 of ref. 9) (Fig. 3a–c).
 Speciﬁc conditions (e.g., DNA concentration, viral titer and number of organoid cells) or settings
 (e.g., voltage used for electroporation) require optimization for each experiment and culture. We
 recommend using control transfection or transduction vectors with a ﬂuorescent label to assess
 efﬁciency of the procedure (Fig. 3b–e).


 Organoid selection and clonal cultures (Steps 66–77)
 Genetically modiﬁed organoids can be selected by antibiotic addition if a resistance gene has been
 introduced or by addition or withdrawal of other medium components. For instance, addition of
 Nutlin-3a will kill all cells expressing wild-type P53 and can be used to select P53-mutated organoids

 (Fig. 3c)7,9. In addition, withdrawal of epidermal growth factor (EGF) can select for cells over-
 expressing KRAS23. We recommend deﬁning the optimal concentration per selection agent and
 organoid culture, which is often the lowest concentration that kills 100% of untreated organoids.
 Selection and propagation of individual organoids can be used to generate a clonal culture (Fig. 3d,e).
 Non-manipulated organoids should be used as a control. Although sub-cloning for each organoid
 culture can be assessed, we recommend using organoid cultures that efﬁciently expand after passaging
 from single cells for better success rates.

 Xenotransplantation (Steps 78–108)
 A large quantity of organoids is necessary for engraftment (Steps 78–89), usually varying between
 0.25 × 106 and 1 × 106 cells per injected site in the form of intact organoids, for a better engraftment
 rate compared to single cells. These numbers require optimization per organoid culture. Organoid
 cultures with a fast growth rate in vitro tend to engraft better in vivo. We describe surgery-free
 estrogen pellet implantation (Steps 90–97; Fig. 4a) before orthotopic organoid injection (Steps
 98–108; Fig. 4b) to provide an exogenous source of estrogen that facilitates tumor engraftment and
 growth24,25 (Fig. 4c). We recommend practicing organoid injection by injecting 30 μl of transplan-
 tation medium with 5% trypan blue, followed by dissection, to conﬁrm localization in the mammary
 fad pad. It is important to be aware of potential bladder complications that might arise with estrogen
 pellets26. Of note, estrogen pellets either were9 or were not7 used in previous BC organoid trans-
 plantation studies. Mice should be monitored closely for signs of discomfort over the duration
 of the experiment.

Materials
 Animals
 Female NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl /SzJ) mice between 6 and 8 weeks of age ! CAUTION Use
 of rodents for research purposes requires approval from the relevant national and institutional reg-
 ulatory bodies. All experiments should be carried out in accordance with the local and national animal
 welfare guidelines and laws.

 Biological material
 This protocol can be applied to human resection or biopsy material of normal, pre-cancerous,
 cancerous and metastatic tissue. Fresh material is the preferred starting material, but tissue can be
 kept in adDMEM/F12+++ with 100 μg/ml of Primocin at 4 °C for up to 72 h before starting
 the procedure ! CAUTION For the use of human material, approval of the relevant national and
 institutional regulatory bodies is necessary, and informed consent should be obtained from all donors.
 ! CAUTION We recommend occasional proﬁling of the organoid cultures with a single-nucleotide
 polymorphism (SNP) array through commercial resources available (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, cat.
 no. 4475394, following the company’s speciﬁc instructions for sample preparation) to rule out cross-
 contamination with a different culture and to regularly test for mycoplasma contamination.

 c


 published half-life of Y-27632 is shorter than the time we advise to store Type 1 and Type 2 expansion
 medium (1 week). In general, 4 °C-stored expansion medium can be used at any moment for organoid
 propagation with good performance within a week from preparation. However, for organoid estab-
 lishment from tissue (Steps 11–40), after genetic manipulation (Steps 65–89) or when passaging single
 organoids (Steps 90–101), we recommend using expansion medium that is as fresh as possible for
 optimal recovery of single cells.

 Transplantation medium
 Prepare this medium while harvesting organoids for transplantation (Steps 105–107). Account for
 40 μl of transplantation buffer per injection, plus at least 10% extra. Mix equal volumes of ice-cold
 Type 1 or Type 2 medium (donor dependent) and BME, avoiding bubbles. Store on ice until organoid
 pellet is ready for resuspension.

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
Procedure
 Establishment of organoids from breast tissue resections ● Timing 4.5–6.5 h
 CRITICAL This section describes the isolation of epithelial cells from breast tissue resections for the


 c
 establishment of organoid cultures (Fig. 2b). When pipetting disrupted tissue, always pre-wet the 5- or
 10-ml sterile serological pipettes with D-BSA medium for preventing tissue sticking to the plastic (Steps
 12, 13, 19, 21, 24 and 32). When receiving resected material from two different locations (ie, normal and
 tumor), start processing the normal tissue and, while this is digesting, process the tumor tissue. The
 derivation success of normal organoids depends on the viability of the stem cells in the normal tissue,
 which are usually present in lower numbers than cancer (stem) cells in tumor tissue. Normal tissue
 should, thus, be processed as soon as possible upon arrival. Resected tissue should be placed in a Falcon
 tube containing 14 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ with Primocin (100 µg/ml) and be transferred to the lab as
 soon as possible for isolation.
 ! CAUTION As the derivation process is performed with primary human material, which could
 potentially carry human pathogens, all steps should be performed wearing appropriate personal
 protective equipment (PPE), while working in a biosafety cabinet, and with the tissue in closed tubes or
 Petri dishes when checking it under the microscope. Working in a biosafety cabinet also reduces the risk
 of contaminating the tissue and isolated organoids with microorganisms.
 CRITICAL Store the Falcon tube containing tissue on wet ice in case it takes up to 72 h to reach the lab
 c


 for isolation.
 CRITICAL The procedures are described for working with 12-well plates. Refer to Table 3 in case a
 c


 culture plate with a different number of wells is desired.

 Tissue preparation ● Timing 30–50 min
 1 Transfer each tissue sample (<3–4 cm3) into a separate 50-ml Falcon tube ﬁlled with D-BSA. Keep
 tissues on ice until starting the isolation.
 2 Register the new sample in the corresponding lab management system.
 3 (Optional) Generate labels for collecting pieces of tissue for different purposes (DNA, RNA, protein
 and/or histology).
 4 Collect the 50-ml Falcon tube containing the normal or tumor tissue and transfer the tissue to a
 10-cm glass Petri dish by decanting the 50-ml Falcon tube (Fig. 2c).
 5 Take a microscopic picture of the tissue, including a ruler in the picture (Fig. 2c). Make a note of
 how the tissue looks (ie, size, fatty, vascularized, necrotic, etc) in the corresponding lab note.
 6 Aspirate the excess D-BSA and cut the tissue into small pieces (2–4 mm3) using two scalpels by
 holding one scalpel in each hand and slicing the tissue while pressing the blades of both scalpels
 against each other.
 7 (Optional) Use a micro-dissecting forceps cleaned with 70% EtOH to transfer 1–2 pieces of
 2–4-mm3 tissue into a 2-ml Eppendorf tube labeled for DNA analysis, snap freeze on dry ice and
 transfer to −20 °C for storage.
 CRITICAL This tissue sample can be used as the reference DNA sample for SNP analysis (see
 c


 ‘Biological material’ section).
 8 (Optional) Fix two pieces of 2–4-mm3 tissue for histology by transferring them into a 15-ml Falcon
 tube labeled with histology label and containing 5 ml of 4% formalin.
 ! CAUTION Perform this step in a fume hood, as formalin is toxic.

 9 (Optional) When future transcriptomic analyses are required, transfer 1–2 pieces of 2–4-mm3
 tissue into a 2-ml microtube labeled with RNA label, snap freeze on dry ice and transfer to a
 −80 °C freezer.
 10 (Optional) When future proteomic analyses are required, transfer 1–2 representative pieces of tissue into
 a 2-ml microtube labeled with protein label, snap freeze on dry ice and transfer to a −80 °C freezer.
 CRITICAL Be aware that optional Steps 7–10 will reduce tissue volume for organoid generation,


 c
 which might result in a longer organoid propagation phase before frozen stocks can be generated.
 On average, 8–10 mm3 would be enough for one well of a 12-well plate, but this is highly variable
 depending on the cellularity of the tissue sample.
 CRITICAL For Steps 7–10, make sure to select tissue pieces that represent different colors or
 c
 regions of the resected tissue to better capture different cell populations present.


 Organoid isolation from tissue ● Timing 1.5–5 h
 11 Mince the remaining tissue into smaller pieces (0.5–1 mm3) with two scalpels as stated in Step 6,
 until the tissue mass looks uniform and appears somewhat viscous.
 12 Add 5 ml of D-BSA into the glass Petri dish and transfer the minced tissue to a 50-ml Falcon tube
 using a 5-ml sterile serological pipette pre-wetted with D-BSA. Wash the same glass Petri dish with
 5 ml of D-BSA and collect residual minced tissue into the same 50-ml Falcon tube.
 13 Add 35 ml of D-BSA to the 50-ml Falcon tube and use a 10-ml sterile serological pipette pre-wetted
 with D-BSA to resuspend the minced tissue by pipetting up and down ﬁve times.
 14 Let the tissue sediment by gravity for 2–3 min, until all tissue pieces are at the bottom of the tube,
 before aspirating all but 10 ml of D-BSA.
 15 Repeat Steps 13 and 14 two more times to wash away potential microorganisms, cell types not
 contributing to the establishment of organoids, such as blood cells, and dead cells and debris.
 16 Aspirate all supernatant carefully, so that only the sedimented tissue pellet remains, and add 10 ml
 of Type 1 medium.
 17 Add 500 µl of collagenase (20 mg/ml stock, ﬁnal concentration 1 mg/ml) and 10 µl of
 ROCK inhibitor (10 mM stock, ﬁnal concentration 10 µM) to the 50-ml Falcon tube containing the
 minced tissue.
 18 Wrap the 50-ml Falcon tube with Paraﬁlm and place the tube at a slight angle (~15°) on top of an
 orbital shaker located inside a heated incubator oven at 37 °C. Set the orbital shaker at 140 r.p.m.
 and digest the tissue for 1–2 h. At this moment, the processing of the next tissue can be initiated.
 CRITICAL Placing the tube at a slight angle facilitates the distribution of minced tissue along the
 c


 tube for proper digestion, as it increases the surface area of tissue exposed to the digestion reagent.
 The angle can be achieved by placing the top of the tube on a 0.5–1-cm platform and resting the
 end of the tube on the shaker.
 19 Pipette up and down 5–10 times every 30 min using a 5-ml sterile serological pipette pre-wetted
 with D-BSA medium to aid digestion. Monitor the digestion of the tissue at least every 30 min,
 using an inverted bright-ﬁeld microscope (×5, ×10 or ×20 objective). When clusters of 5–10 cells
 are observed (Fig. 2g), digestion is complete.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 CRITICAL Normal tissue digestion typically takes 2 h, whereas tumor tissue digestion typically
 c


 takes 0.5–2 h. The time of digestion depends on several variables, such as the time from tissue
 isolation to digestion, tissue size and consistency and the quality and activity of the digestion
 reagent. Prolonged tissue storage before processing or freshly made digestion reagent reduces the
 digestion time, whereas solid, ﬁrm tissue or an older digestion reagent increases the digestion time.
 20 After incubation, take the tube from the heated incubator oven and clean with 70% EtOH. Add
 1 ml of FBS directly to the 50-ml Falcon tube to stop the collagenase digestion.
 21 Homogenize the digested tissue by pipetting it up and down vigorously with a 10-ml sterile
 serological pipette pre-wetted with D-BSA.
 22 Pre-wet a 100-µm strainer by pipetting 10 ml of D-BSA on the strainer into a new 50-ml Falcon
 tube. Swirl the 50-ml tube to wet the sides of the tube and discard the D-BSA. Then, strain the
 digested tissue over the 100-µm strainer into the 50-ml Falcon tube (both pre-wetted with D-BSA).
 23 Transfer the unﬁltered tissue pieces back into the initial 50-ml Falcon tube by reversing the ﬁlter
 and ﬂushing with 10 ml of D-BSA.
 24 Pipette the digested tissue up and down vigorously, using a 10-ml sterile serological pipette
 pre-wetted with D-BSA.

 25 Reverse the 100-µm ﬁlter and strain the tissue again, collecting the cell suspension in the same 50-
 ml Falcon tube from Step 22.
 26 Repeat Steps 23–25 two more times, using the same ﬁlter to avoid wasting precious tissue.
 27 Centrifuge the ﬂow-through from Steps 22–26 at 450g for 5 min at 8 °C.
 28 Aspirate the supernatant, leaving the last 4 ml to avoid disturbing the pellet. Resuspend the tissue
 pellet in the remaining 4 ml with a sterile serological pipette and transfer it to a 15-ml Falcon tube
 pre-wetted with D-BSA.
 29 Add 10 ml of D-BSA with a sterile serological pipette and homogenize by pipetting up and down
 several times.
 30 Centrifuge the 15-ml Falcon tube at 450g for 5 min at 8 °C. Aspirate the supernatant very carefully
 with a vacuum system and clean tip until 1 ml is left. Let the tube rest for 1 min to allow the D-BSA
 from the side of the tube to settle at the bottom and remove the residual D-BSA with a
 P1000 pipette.
 31 (Optional) If the pellet is partially red, add 1–2 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer with a P1000 pipette,
 resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down several times and incubate for 2 min at RT before
 continuing with Step 32.
 CRITICAL For pellets <100 μl in size, 1 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer is sufﬁcient. For pellets
 c


 >100 μl, use 2 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer.
 32 Add 10 ml D-BSA to the 15-ml Falcon tube with a sterile serological pipette and pipette up and
 down several times using the same pipette.
 33 Centrifuge the cells and aspirate the medium as described in Step 30.
 PAUSE POINT At this point, cells can be frozen with Recovery Cell Freezing Medium by adding
 j


 1 ml, resuspending the cell pellet and transferring to a cryovial. Preserving part of the isolation yield
 will ensure a backup of the sample in case the culture is lost at an early passage before
 cryopreservation (e.g., due to bacterial or fungal contamination or improper handling by an
 inexperienced user).
 34 Resuspend the pellet in an appropriate amount of BME. As a guideline, 200 µl is sufﬁcient for a
 pellet of ~50 µl. The amount of BME to add scales linearly with the pellet volume.
 CRITICAL After ﬁltering the digested tissue, the cell pellet should be easy to resuspend in BME.
 c


 However, if the pellet is very sticky, cut the tip of the 200-µl low-retention ﬁlter tip.
 CRITICAL BME must be kept on ice to prevent solidiﬁcation. Work quickly to prevent the BME
 c


 from solidifying but carefully to prevent bubble formation.
 35 Plate 100 µl of BME-containing cells in multiple small drops (<20 µl each) per well in a 12-well
 plate (Fig. 2e). When tissue yield is limited, plating can be scaled down to 24-well format by
 adapting all volumes accordingly (Table 3).
 36 Turn the plate upside down and leave in the biosafety cabinet for 5 min.
 37 Transfer the plate, upside down, into a 37 °C incubator and leave to solidify for 30 min.
 CRITICAL Solidifying the BME upside down prevents the tissue fragments from sinking and
 c


 attaching to the bottom of the plate.
 38 Add 750 µl of pre-warmed (RT to 37 °C) Type 1 or Type 2 medium to each well and transfer to an
 incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Refer to Table 3 for appropriate media volumes per type
 of culture plate.
 CRITICAL For each culture, test both Type 1 and Type 2 expansion medium (Fig. 2a; Table 2).
 c


 Occasionally monitor organoid growth with an inverted bright-ﬁeld microscope (×5, ×10 or ×20
 objective) and continue with the type of medium that results in the highest organoid conﬂuency,
 thus yielding the highest outgrowth. Type 1 is typically better for BC organoids; Type 2 is typically
 better for normal organoids (Table 1).
 39 (Optional) Take microscopic pictures of representative drops for documentation of organoid
 density and morphology (×2.5 and ×10 magniﬁcations).
 40 Refresh culture medium every 2–4 d by following Steps 41 and 42. After isolation, organoids can be
 split for the ﬁrst time after 7–21 d by following Steps 43–48.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 CRITICAL After 3–4 d, it should be possible to identify organoids with an inverted bright-ﬁeld
 c


 microscope (×5, ×10 or ×20 objective). Monitor organoid growth closely and ensure that most have
 reached a size of at least 100 μm before passaging.
 CRITICAL At early passages, it is possible to observe highly elongated ﬁbroblast growing on the
 c


 bottom of the culture plate. Avoid scratching the bottom of the plate while passaging to prevent
 transfer of the ﬁbroblast to the next passage.

 Refreshing medium ● Timing 5 min
 41 Tilt the plate at a 45° angle and aspirate all expansion medium from the well containing cultured
 organoids by placing the aspiration tip to the side of the well. Avoid getting close to the BME drops.
 CRITICAL Use a clean tip for each different organoid culture and remove the lid from one culture


 c
 plate at a time to avoid cross-contamination.
 42 Tilt the plate at a 45° angle and gently add dropwise 750 μl of expansion medium to each well using
 a P1000 pipette when refreshing a few wells or a 5-ml or 100-ml sterile serological pipette when
 refreshing many wells. Aim at the bottom corner of the well to avoid disturbing the BME drops.
 CRITICAL Do not touch the well while adding expansion medium to avoid cross-contamination.

 c
 Organoid maintenance and cryopreservation ● Timing 75 min–2 h
 Organoid dissociation ● Timing 30–60 min
 CRITICAL This section describes the culture of normal breast and BC organoids in a 12-well plate.
 c


 Scale the volumes of reagents needed using Table 3 as a reference if using a different well size.
 CRITICAL To prevent cross-contamination of different organoid cultures, work cautiously when
 c


 handling different cultures simultaneously.
 43 Dissociate organoids into either single cells (Option A) or fragments (Option B).
 (A) Dissociating organoids into single cells by TrypLE digestion ● Timing 10–40 min
 (i) Aspirate all expansion medium from a well containing organoids by holding the plate at a
 45° angle and placing the aspiration tip to the side of the well, not getting close to the BME
 drops. When passaging multiple wells of organoids of the same culture, all medium of
 those wells can be aspirated at once with the same tip.
 (ii) Add 1 ml of TrypLE to the well and dissociate the BME by forcefully pipetting up and
 down 6–10 times per well with a P1000 pipette, aiming at the BME drops.
 (iii) (Optional) Repeat Step (ii) with other wells of the same organoid culture by transferring
 the 1 ml of organoids in TrypLE to the next well with organoids without expansion
 medium and repeating the pipetting process. Up to three wells of organoids can be
 combined in 1 ml of TrypLE.
 (iv) Directly after completing Step (ii) or (iii), hold the plate at a 45° angle and forcefully pipette
 the BME-TrypLE mixture with organoids up and down ten times. This will dissociate most
 of the BME, but the organoids will remain intact. Bubble formation is not harmful but can
 accelerate the dissociation.
 (v) Incubate the plate at RT for 5–10 min.
 (vi) Hold the plate at a 45° angle and forcefully pipette the BME-TrypLE mixture with
 organoids up and down ten times to mechanically dissociate the organoids.
 (vii) Determine if a single-cell solution has been achieved by checking the well with an inverted
 bright-ﬁeld microscope (×5, ×10 or ×20 objective) (Fig. 2g). If partially dissociated
 organoids are still visible, repeat Steps (v) and (vi) until a single-cell solution has been
 achieved. Continue with Step 44.
 CRITICAL Incubation time varies among donors, but the total incubation time should,
 c


 ideally, take no more than 20–25 min. For cultures that are hard to dissociate, the plates
 can be incubated at 37 °C instead of RT in Step (v).
 (B) Dissociating organoids to fragments by shearing with TrypLE ● Timing 10–20 min
 (i) Remove 500 μl of expansion medium from the well containing organoids, leaving ~250 μl
 in the well, by holding the plate at a 45° angle and placing the aspiration tip to the side of
 the well, not getting close to the BME drops.
 (ii) Add TrypLE to the well, to a ﬁnal volume of 1 ml, and dissociate the BME by forcefully
 pipetting up and down 6–10 times per well with a P1000 pipette, aiming at the BME drops.
 (iii) (Optional) Repeat Step (ii) with other wells of the same organoid culture by transferring
 the 1 ml of organoids in TrypLE to the next well with organoids without expansion
 medium and repeating the pipetting process. Up to three wells of organoids can be
 combined in 1 ml of TrypLE.
 (iv) Directly after Step (iii), hold the plate at a 45° angle and forcefully pipette the organoids in TrypLE
 up and down ten times. This will dissociate most of the BME, but the organoids will still be intact.
 (v) To shear the organoids, hold the plate at a 45° angle and forcefully pipette up and down
 10–20 times, ﬁrmly pressing the 1-ml tip to the bottom corner of the well to create a small
 opening for organoid disruption.

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 (vi) Check the organoids with an inverted bright-ﬁeld microscope (×5, ×10 or ×20 objective).
 Repeat Step (v) until the desired fragment size has been achieved (Fig. 2g). Continue
 with Step 44.
 CRITICAL Organoid shearing will result in a suspension of single cells and small-to-large


 c
 organoid fragments. Shearing is optimal when most cells are present in the form of small
 organoid fragments (usually containing 5–20 cells or 20–50 µm in diameter).
 44 Transfer single cells or organoid fragments into a 15-ml Falcon tube with 10 ml of ice-cold
 adDMEM/F12+++, using a P1000 pipette. Rinse the well with 1 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ to
 ensure that no dissociated organoids remain in the well. A maximum of six wells with organoids
 from the same culture can be pooled in one 15-ml Falcon tube.
 j PAUSE POINT The 15-ml Falcon tube with processed organoids can be stored on ice for 1 h to
 ﬁrst harvest multiple cultures before continuing with Step 45, with minimal effect on organoid
 recovery after passaging.
 45 Centrifuge the 15-ml Falcon tube with organoids at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C and conﬁrm presence of
 a BME-free pellet by eye (Fig. 2d). Presence of residual BME in the pellet should be avoided as this
 layer might contain dead cells and debris that can negatively inﬂuence organoid growth.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 46 Remove the supernatant by decanting the ﬂuid into a waste bottle and put the pellet on ice for
 1 min. Remove the remaining supernatant carefully with a P1000 pipette.
 47 (Optional) If you want to count the cells at this stage, resuspend the cell pellet in 250–500 μl of
 expansion medium per harvested well, taking 10 μl of cells and mixing it with 10 μl trypan blue
 solution and count using a counting chamber and an inverted bright-ﬁeld microscope (×10 or
 ×20 objective). One conﬂuent well of a 12-well plate commonly contains 200,000–500,000 cells.
 Before continuing with Step 48, spin down the non-counted cells at 300g for 5 min and remove the
 supernatant.
 48 To directly plate organoids for passaging, continue to Step 49. To genetically manipulate organoids,
 continue to Step 65A for Lipofectamine 2000-based transfection, to Step 65B for electroporation-
 based transfection and to Step 65C for lentiviral transduction.


 (Optional) Plating organoids for passaging ● Timing 15–20 min
 49 Use a P200 or P1000 pipette to resuspend the pellet of dissociated organoids in the 15-ml tube in
 ice-cold BME by carefully pipetting up and down approximately ten times. Plate in multiple small
 drops (<20 µl each) per well (Fig. 2e). Refer to Table 3 for appropriate number of BME drops and
 total BME volume for different culture plates.
 CRITICAL In addition to using a new tip, we recommend cleaning the P200 or P1000 pipette
 c


 with 70% EtOH before using it to resuspend the pellet of the next culture, to prevent cross-
 contamination.
 50 Swiftly but carefully ﬂip the plate upside down before placing in the incubator to prevent organoids
 from sinking to the bottom and attaching to the plate.
 51 Place the plate in an incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C) for 10–20 min to allow the BME to solidify.
 52 Supplement the well with freshly passaged organoids with 750 μl of pre-warmed (RT, 37 °C) Type 1
 or Type 2 medium in a dropwise manner. Refer to Table 3 for the appropriate media volumes when
 using a 6, 24, 48 or 96-well culture plate.
 53 Refresh expansion medium every 2–4 d by following Steps 41 and 42. Occasionally check
 organoid density and morphology with an inverted bright-ﬁeld microscope (×5, ×10 or
 ×20 objective).
 CRITICAL Organoids secrete factors that stimulate cell proliferation. Therefore, culturing with an
 c


 organoid density that is not too sparse (risk of slow growth and cell death) or too dense (risk of
 overgrowth) is a critical factor for a well-growing, viable culture (Fig. 2h-j).
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING


 (Optional) Freezing intact organoids ● Timing 10–15 min
 CRITICAL Make sure to freeze organoids 2–7 d before they reach optimal conﬂuency for splitting,
 c


 usually when they reach a diameter of 100–150 μm. This ensures a recovery efﬁciency after thawing of
 close to 90%.
 54 Follow Steps 43A, (i)–(iv) to remove intact organoids from the BME.
 55 Follow Steps 44–46 to wash and pellet the intact organoids.

 56 Resuspend the pelleted organoids in Recovery Cell Freezing Medium. Combine up to four wells of a
 12-well plate of the same donor in 1 ml of freezing medium. Transfer the organoids in freezing
 medium to a 2-ml cryovial, storing 1 ml per vial.
 57 Transfer the cryovials to a −80 °C cell-freezing container. Store at −80 °C at least overnight before
 transferring to a longer-term storage method.
 PAUSE POINT Organoids can be stored at −80 °C for up to 1 month or in liquid

 nitrogen indeﬁnitely.


 (Optional) Thawing organoids ● Timing 20 min
 58 Transport the cryovial containing organoids from the −80 °C or liquid nitrogen storage to the cell
 culture laboratory on dry ice.
 59 Quickly thaw the cryovial containing organoids in a 37 °C water bath, clean the vial using 70%
 EtOH and dropwise add 1 ml of pre-warmed (37 °C) adDMEM/F12 +++ supplemented with
 10 μM ROCK inhibitor with a P1000 pipette while tapping the bottom of the vial.
 CRITICAL ROCK inhibitor is added to enhance recovery from freeze–thawing.

 add 10 ml of pre-warmed (37 °C) adDMEM/F12 +++ supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor.
 61 Centrifuge the 15-ml Falcon tube with organoids at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C
 62 Remove the supernatant and put the pellet on ice for a few minutes to allow the residual supernatant to
 reach the bottom of the tube. Remove the remaining supernatant carefully with a P200 pipette.
 63 Follow Steps 49–53 to plate the organoids.
 64 Refresh the expansion medium every 2–4 d by following Steps 41 and 42.


 (Optional) Genetic manipulation
 65 If you want to genetically manipulate the organoids (Fig. 3a), follow Option A (Lipofectamine
 2000), Option B (electroporation) or Option C (lentiviral transduction (Fig. 3b).
 CRITICAL Use 20–50% of one conﬂuent well of organoids (12-well plate) or
 c


 100,000–200,000 single organoid cells for each transfection or transduction condition.
 CRITICAL Plate the manipulated organoids at least twice as densely as compared to standard
 c


 passaging.
 CRITICAL For optimal efﬁciency and organoid recovery, make sure to use an organoid culture
 c


 with minimal presence of cell debris and dying organoids as starting material (Fig. 2i,j) and process
 organoids into small fragments containing several cells (Fig. 2g).
 CRITICAL After genetic manipulation of organoids, expression of transgenes can disappear due
 c


 to silencing or genetic rearrangements, especially in tumor organoids. It is, therefore, important to
 supplement the expansion medium with the appropriate selection agent from the manipulation
 onward to maintain transgene expression in close to 100% of cells.
 (A) Transfection of organoids using Lipofectamine 2000 ● Timing 5 h
 (i) Dissociate and pellet the organoids as described in Steps 43A/43B–46. After aspirating the
 supernatant from the organoid pellet as described in Step 46, continue with Step (ii).
 (ii) Resuspend the pellet of dissociated organoids in 450 μl of Type 1 or Type 2 expansion
 medium per condition using a P1000 pipette, by pipetting ﬁve times up and down, and
 transfer 450 μl to each well of a 24-well suspension plate.
 PAUSE POINT Place the plate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 while the transfection mix is

 the Falcon tube with dissociated organoids on ice while preparing the transfection mix.
 (ii) Prepare the transfection mix. Per condition, add 10 μg of plasmid (in max 10 μl) to a
 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and top up with Opti-MEM to a ﬁnal volume of 100 μl. Vortex the
 Eppendorf tube brieﬂy and place on ice for 1 min.
 (iii) Resuspend the pellet of dissociated organoids in the transfection mix by gently pipetting up

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 Organoid selection ● Timing 10 min
 CRITICAL Organoid selection (Fig. 3c) can be started 3 d after transfection or transduction, by adding


 c
 the selection agent to the expansion medium. It is advised that the concentration of the selection agent is
 ﬁrst optimized by culturing organoids using a titration of the selection agent. We advise to use the lowest
 concentration that kills 100% of untreated organoids after 3–10 d of culture.
 66 Three days after transfection (Step 65A or 65B) or transduction (Step 65C), aspirate all medium
 from a well containing organoids by holding the plate at a 45° angle and placing the aspiration tip
 to the side of the well, avoiding getting close to the BME drops.
 67 Gently add 750 μl of expansion medium (with the appropriate concentration of selection agent) in a
 dropwise manner to each well.
 68 Refresh the expansion medium every 2–4 d following Steps 41 and 42 until organoids have reached
 a size sufﬁcient for further passaging (diameter of <300 μm; Steps 43–53) or clone picking
 (diameter of 200–500 μm; Steps 69–77).


 Clone picking ● Timing 1.5–2 h
 CRITICAL To ensure that individual organoids used for clone picking originated from a single cell, it
 c


 is best to generate a culture with sparsely growing organoids after selection (Fig. 3e). If no selection is
 applied, this can also be achieved by passaging at low density.
 69 Prepare 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, one per organoid, with 100 μl of TrypLE.
 70 Disrupt the BME drops with cultured organoids by pipetting the 750-μl expansion medium up and
 down 8–10 times with a P1000 pipette, aiming at the top of the BME drops, and transfer the
 organoids to a 10-cm culturing dish with 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ at RT.
 71 Use an inverted bright-ﬁeld microscope (×20 objective) and pick individual organoids with a P20
 pipette, thereby aspirating as little volume as possible (<10 μl). Transfer each individual organoid to
 a separate 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube with TrypLE. When working outside of a biosafety cabinet with
 primary human cells, it is essential to work fast to avoid contamination and wear appropriate PPE.
 CRITICAL Pre-wet the 20-μl tip with Type 1 or Type 2 expansion medium to prevent organoids

 sticking to the tip. Alternatively, D-BSA or adDMEM/F12+++ can be used.
 72 Incubate the Eppendorf tubes with a single organoid each for 5 min at RT. Using a P200 pipette,
 add 100 μl of FBS at RT to the Eppendorf tube and directly resuspend the clone by pipetting 3–10
 times up and down.
 73 Use an inverted bright-ﬁeld microscope (×10 or ×20 objective) to check the dissociation.
 Repeat Step 72 until the organoid is dissociated into small fragments and/or single cells (see Fig. 2g
 as reference).
 CRITICAL The incubation time (usually 5–20 min total) and number of times to resuspend
 c


 (usually 5–30 times total) need to be optimized per organoid culture. The digestion time of a clonal
 organoid is often similar to the digestion time of the parental culture when digesting for passaging.
 CRITICAL Make sure not to over-digest the organoid, as this will lead to a decreased viability.
 c


 Do not digest the single organoid for longer than 25 min.
 74 Centrifuge the Eppendorf tubes at 300g for 5 min. Carefully aspirate the supernatant with a P200
 pipette and resuspend the pellet in 30 μl of ice-cold BME by gently pipetting up and down
 ﬁve times.
 75 Plate the dissociated organoid in a 48-well plate in one drop of 30-μl BME, in the center of the well,
 and incubate for 10–20 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2.
 76 Tilt the plate at a 45° angle and gently add 250 μl of expansion medium to each well in a dropwise
 manner, using a P1000 pipette. Aim at the bottom corner of the well, avoiding the BME drops.
 CRITICAL Continue to supplement the expansion medium with the selection agent to prevent
 c


 potential outgrowth of organoids in which the transgene is silenced.
 77 Refresh the expansion medium every 3–4 d. After ~7–21 d, when organoids reach a diameter of
 200–500 μm, they can be passaged as described in Steps 43A/43B and Steps 44–53 to an appropriate culture
 plate (Table 3). The expected outgrowth efﬁciency is 20–80% and depends on the organoid culture.

 CRITICAL Before scaling up organoid cultures for transplantation, we recommend measuring the
 c


 number of cells harvested on average per well, using Steps 78–84 below, and using this number to
 estimate the required number of wells to expand for transplantation.

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 CRITICAL Use organoids for transplantation when they are still in their proliferative state, 2–5 d


 c
 before they would normally be split, as this will improve engraftment efﬁciency. As a guideline, we
 recommend harvesting organoids passaged at a weekly interval at day 5 and organoids passaged
 biweekly at day 10, counted from the day they were last split. Avoid growing organoids larger
 than 70 μm, because they will be ﬁltered out during organoid harvesting to avoid clogging the
 injection needle.

 Deﬁning the number of wells required for transplantation ● Timing 30–60 min
 78 Place a 70-μm cell strainer on a 50-ml Falcon tube and pre-wash the strainer with 5 ml of ice-cold
 adDMEM/F12+++.
 79 Harvest intact organoids from two representative wells of a 12-well plate as described in Steps 43A
 (i)–(iv). Pipette this solution over the 70-μm strainer with a P1000 pipette and rinse the strainer
 with another 5 ml of adDMEM/F12+++. Transfer the ﬁltrated solution to a 15-ml Falcon tube.
 80 Centrifuge the 15-ml Falcon tube for 5 min at 300g at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant by decanting
 into a waste bottle; place the Falcon tube at RT for 1 min; remove the remaining supernatant with a
 P1000 pipette; and resuspend the organoid pellet in 1 ml of TrypLE.
 81 Incubate for 5 min at 37 °C and thoroughly pipette up and down ten times with a P1000 pipette.
 82 Use an inverted bright-ﬁeld microscope (×5, ×10 or ×20 objective) to assess digestion. If required,
 repeat Step 81 until a single-cell suspension has been achieved.
 83 Add 9 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ and centrifuge the 15-ml Falcon tube for 5 min at 300g at 4 °C.
 Leave 1 ml of supernatant in the Falcon tube and resuspend the cells.
 84 Mix 10 μl of the single-cell suspension with 10 μl of trypan blue solution and count using a
 counting chamber and an inverted bright-ﬁeld microscope (×10 or ×20 objective). To calculate the
 average number of cells per well, take the mean of the two wells counted. From this, extrapolate the
 number of wells necessary for the desired number of injections.
 CRITICAL Account for at least 10–20% excess. For example, when injecting ten mammary fat
 c


 pads with 1 × 106 cells, prepare 10 × 106 plus 20% = 12 × 106 cells.

 Organoid harvesting for transplantation ● Timing Option A 60–90 min; Timing Option B
 30–60 min
 85 To prepare the cells for transplantation, two different methods can be used to take the organoids
 out of the BME. For using Cell Recovery Solution, follow Option A; for using TrypLE, follow
 Option B.
 CRITICAL Compared to organoid harvesting by TrypLE, harvesting by Cell Recovery Solution
 c


 requires less hands-on time and dissolves all BME more efﬁciently, usually resulting in a tight,
 BME-free organoid pellet. However, Option A might occasionally result in organoid dissociation,
 which is more likely to happen for organoid lines that dissociate fast into single cells upon TrypLE
 digestion (Step 43A). If this happens, dissociated cells can be propagated again in BME by following
 Steps 44–53. However, we advise to test one well of organoid culture by following Option A before
 the day of transplantation, to test if they remain intact throughout the process. If not,
 follow Option B.
 (A) Removing organoids from BME with Cell Recovery Solution
 (i) Remove the expansion medium from the number of wells needed, as calculated in Steps
 78–84, by holding the plate at a 45° angle and aspirating with a vacuum system and
 clean tip.
 (ii) Add 1 ml of Cell Recovery Solution per well. Incubate for 30–60 min on a horizontal
 orbital shaker at 20 r.p.m. at 4 °C.
 CRITICAL The incubation is ready when the BME drops are breaking up and detaching
 c


 from the plate.
 (iii) Place a 70-μm cell strainer on a 50-ml Falcon tube and pre-wash the strainer with 2 ml of
 ice-cold adDMEM/F12+++.
 (iv) Resuspend the organoid suspension by pipetting up and down 5–10 times with a P1000
 pipette, holding the plate at a 45° angle. Pipette the suspension with intact organoids over
 the 70-μm strainer into the 50-ml Falcon tube, combining up to six wells of the same
 culture. Rinse the strainer with 6 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ and transfer the ﬁltrated
 solution to a 15-ml Falcon tube.
 (v) Continue to Step 86.

 (B) Removing organoids from BME with TrypLE
 (i) Place a 70-μm cell strainer on a 50-ml Falcon tube and pre-wash the strainer with 5 ml of

 (ii) Remove the expansion medium from the number of wells needed, calculated in Steps

 (iii) Resuspend up to three wells of the same culture in 1 ml of TrypLE, as described in Steps

 (iv) Pipette the intact organoid solution over the 70-μm strainer into the 50-ml Falcon tube,
 combining up to six wells of the same culture. Rinse the strainer with 5 ml of adDMEM/
 F12+++ and transfer the ﬁltrated solution to a 15-ml Falcon tube.
 86 Centrifuge the 15-ml Falcon tube at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C. Conﬁrm by eye that a tight BME-free
 pellet is present (Fig. 2d).
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 87 Remove the supernatant by decanting the ﬂuid into a waste bottle. Let the tube rest for 1 min to
 allow the adDMEM/F12+++ from the side of the tube to settle at the bottom and remove the
 residual adDMEM/F12+++ with a P1000 pipette.
 88 Pool the organoids from the same culture together in 1 ml of Type 1 or Type 2 expansion medium
 and transfer to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. Centrifuge the tube at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C.
 89 Remove all supernatant carefully with a P1000 pipette, estimate the volume of the pellet and add
 ice-cold transplantation buffer up to a total volume of 40 ul × the number of injection sites (eg, for
 ten injections, the total volume of organoid pellet + transplantation buffer = 400 ul). Mix well by
 pipetting up and down ten times with a P1000 pipette. Prevent bubble formation.
 CRITICAL Example: for ten injections, make at least enough for 12 injections.

 Implantation of the estrogen pellet ● Timing ~ 5 min per mouse
 ! CAUTION All animal experiments should conform to local and national animal welfare regulations
 and guidelines.
 90 Implant the estrogen pellet while the organoids are stored on ice until injection, or implant up
 to 1 d before organoid injection to minimize the time the organoids are stored on ice.
 91 Prepare the implantation by placing the estrogen pellet in the trocar.
 CRITICAL Make sure the trocar has been cleaned and sterilized with 70% alcohol and is
 c


 completely dry before inserting the estrogen pellet.
 92 Anesthetize the mouse with 3–4% (vol/vol) isoﬂurane in an induction chamber.
 93 Carefully take the mouse out of the induction chamber and place in front of you with its back facing
 up and toward you from the anterior–lateral side.
 CRITICAL The mouse will no longer receive anaesthesia at this point, so it is important to
 c


 proceed swiftly and carefully.
 94 Fix the dorsal skin of the neck between the thumb and index ﬁnger. Position the trocar with
 estrogen pellet ﬂat on the head of the mouse (Fig. 4a) and inject the needle subcutaneously, with the
 tip facing down, into the skin of the neck.
 95 Insert the estrogen pellet by pushing the inner cylinder forward, releasing the pellet into
 the skin pocket.
 96 Carefully take out the trocar while keeping the pellet steady in the skin between the thumb and
 index ﬁnger. When organoid injection directly follows estrogen pellet injection, continue with Step
 102; when organoids are injected the next day, continue with Step 97.
 97 Gently place the mouse back into the cage and monitor until recovery from anesthesia.

 syringe. Place the syringe on ice in between the two injections.
 105 Position the syringe ﬂat on the mouse and insert the needle ~3 mm below the 4th nipple and move
 the tip of the needle right under the nipple, ~1 mm deep into the fat pad (Fig. 4b). Steadily inject
 40 μl of organoid suspension into the fat pad.
 106 Take the mouse off anesthesia and gently place it into a clean cage, placed on a heating pad, to
 recover from anesthesia.
 107 Monitor the mouse until awake and mobile.
 108 Monitor tumor growth by palpation of the injection site at least twice per week. The tumor onset
 depends on the organoid culture and typically ranges from 2 weeks to 4 months (Fig. 4c). The
 proportion of organoid cultures that can engraft in vivo is ~50% for cultures that can be passaged at
 least 1:2 every 2 weeks.

Anticipated results
 Organoids derived from BC tissue can display solid (~60% of cultures), cystic (<5%), grape-like
 (~20%) or mixed morphologies (~20%) (Fig. 5a,b). BC organoids vary substantially in their growth
 rate but can reach high expansion speeds for some donors (1:6 every week; Table 1). Once established
 (e.g., > passage 5 in vitro), BC organoids rarely stop growing or reduce growth speed. Organoid
 establishment efﬁciency ranges between 55% and 70% for most BC subtypes and is ~40% for triple-
 negative breast cancer (TNBC; Fig. 5c,d), suggesting that it is challenging for the often aggressive and

 samples) during culturing, and few samples gain ER (~10%) or HER2 (<5%) expression (Fig. 5e,f and
 Table 1). The time in culture at which receptor expression reduces or increases can vary and should
 be assessed for each culture. Reasons for these changes are currently unclear but could be inﬂuenced
 by propagating organoids in Type 1 or Type 2 expansion medium, culture-induced gene silencing or
 outgrowth of certain subclones. Researchers should be aware that organoids generated from tumor
 resections can be contaminated with normal cells, which is expected to be the case for <10% of tumor
 samples. However, as normal organoids generally grow slowly (Table 1) and ultimately stop growing9,
 normal cells will probably be lost during culture over time. It is not possible to distinguish normal
 cells from tumor cells by eye using light microscopy, but pathologists are often able to conﬁrm
 normal or tumorous origin of a culture by immunohistochemical analysis. When the tumor harbors
 p53 mutations, Nutlin-3a can be added to the expansion medium to select for tumor cells, ensuring
 death of all normal cells that are potentially present (Fig. 3c). Conﬁrmation of the cancerous nature of
 the sample can be achieved by assessing genomic alterations, either by whole-genome or whole-
 exome sequencing or by comparative genomic hybridization4. We have used BC organoids to
 illustrate the potential of targeting BCL2 in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors in ER+ BC orga-
 noids in vitro27 and have, furthermore, shown that BC cultures can retain responsiveness or resis-
 tance to HER2 blocking by afatinib in vitro after xenotransplantation in vivo7.
 Regarding normal breast organoid cultures, the rate of establishment is almost 100%8,9. However,
 their growth rate is generally low (split ratio of 1:2 every 2 weeks at best; Table 1) and declines over
 time, and cultures have limited growth potential (up to in vitro passage ~20)9. Normal breast
 organoids display different morphologies (Fig. 6a), including mature luminal-type cystic structures,
 luminal progenitor-type solid, budding structures and basal/stem cell-type dense, solid structures
 (Fig. 6b)8. Normal organoids can display as branching or cystic structures containing a central lumen
 (Fig. 6c,d). CyTOF analysis conﬁrms the presence of basal, luminal progenitor and mature luminal
 cells in cultured normal organoids (Fig. 6e).
 We offer different options to alter the ratio of basal, luminal progenitor and mature luminal cells
 (Fig. 6f). These manipulations can be useful for short-term study of speciﬁc cell types but can affect
 the morphology and long-term growth of the culture. Furthermore, we have genetically edited normal
 breast organoids using CRISPR–Cas9 (Fig. 3b,c), showing that mutating P53, PTEN and RB1 in
 normal organoids is sufﬁcient to transform them into organoids that form ER+ tumors upon
 xenotransplantation in vivo (Fig. 4c)9. This illustrates the potential utility of this model to increase
 understanding of the early molecular events that culminate in speciﬁc subtypes of BC.

Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form provides structure for consistency and transparency
in reporting. For further information on Nature Research policies, see our Editorial Policies and the Editorial Policy Checklist.


Statistics
For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.
n/a Confirmed
 The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement
 A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly
 The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided
 Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.

 A description of all covariates tested
 A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons
 A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient)
 AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)

 For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted
 Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.

 For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings
 For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes
 Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated
 Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.


Software and code
Policy information about availability of computer code
 Data collection No software used.

 Data analysis Graphpad Prism version 8 was used for the graph plotting. Imaris software (Bitplane) version 8.2.1 was used for image processing and
 visualisation.
