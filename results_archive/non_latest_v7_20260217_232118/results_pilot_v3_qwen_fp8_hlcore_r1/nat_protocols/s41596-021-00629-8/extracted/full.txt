 Generation of heart-forming organoids from
 human pluripotent stem cells
 1,2 1✉

 Heart-forming organoids (HFOs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a complex, highly structured
 in vitro model of early heart, foregut and vasculature development. The model represents a potent tool for various
 applications, including teratogenicity studies, gene function analysis and drug discovery. Here, we provide a detailed
 protocol describing how to form HFOs within 14 d. In an initial 4 d preculture period, hPSC aggregates are individually
 formed in a 96-well format and then Matrigel-embedded. Subsequently, the chemical WNT pathway modulators
 CHIR99021 and IWP2 are applied, inducing directed differentiation. This highly robust protocol can be used on many
 different hPSC lines and be combined with manipulation technologies such as gene targeting and drug testing. HFO
 formation can be assessed by numerous complementary methods, ranging from various imaging approaches to gene
 expression studies. Here, we highlight the ﬂow cytometry-based analysis of individual HFOs, enabling the quantitative
 monitoring of lineage formation.

 Introduction
 Over the last decade, a novel in vitro model has emerged termed ‘organoids’. Organoids are typically
 three-dimensional (3D) cellular clusters that resemble key aspects of native tissues, including their
 cellular composition, morphology and functionality, thereby representing an intermediate between
 conventional 2D or 3D cell cultures and animal models1. Organoids have been generated for a broad
 range of tissues, including the intestine2, kidney3 and brain4, and can be used for various applications
 in basic and translational research1,5. We recently established a novel organoid model termed ‘heart-
 forming organoids’ (HFOs), which resemble early human heart, foregut and vasculature develop-
 ment, and which can, for example, be used for monitoring genetic defects in vitro6. In this protocol,
 we provide additional details of the method we used to facilitate the robust differentiation of HFOs
 from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including embryonic stem cells and induced
 PSCs (iPSCs).
 HFOs consist of a speciﬁc morphological structure, which is schematically depicted in Fig. 1: a
 dense myocardial layer (ML) composed of cardiomyocytes is lined by endocardial-like cells, which
 surround an inner core (IC). The IC comprises anterior foregut endoderm (AFE) tissue and is
 pervaded by vessel-like structures. The ML is covered by a loose outer layer (OL) consisting of
 cardiomyocytes, septum-transversum-like cells and liver progenitors (posterior foregut endoderm,
 PFE), and further enclosed by an outermost layer of mesenchymal cells6. Together, HFOs closely
 resemble patterns of early heart anlagen prior to heart tube formation, which form by an inductive
 exchange with the developing foregut endoderm in the embryo7. As the ﬁrst hPSC-derived model
 mimicking this tissue interplay, HFOs open new perspectives for investigating mechanisms of human
 embryogenesis, disease modeling and drug discovery.

 Development of the protocol
 In general, organoids can be derived from adult stem cells or PSCs. The basic concept of organoid
 formation relies on the stem cells’ capability to self-organize into organ-like tissue patterns upon
 proper stimulation in vitro. Cells are typically exposed to tissue-speciﬁc patterning factors inside a
 hydrogel such as Matrigel, which enables the formation of complex 3D structures1,5. For the for-
 mation of HFOs, we accordingly combined Matrigel encapsulation of hPSC aggregates with an
 established strategy for directed cardiac differentiation based on biphasic WNT pathway modulation

 using the small molecules CHIR99021 (CHIR) and IWP26,8,9. In addition to requiring Matrigel
 encapsulation and WNT pathway modulation, proper induction of the spatiotemporal patterning of
 HFOs required the exact interplay of several deﬁned cues, in particular the aggregate size, culture
 medium volume and process timing combined with a speciﬁc concentration of CHIR. In addition to
 cardiomyogenesis, CHIR treatment has been used to ‘kick-start’ the differentiation of hPSCs into
 multiple other lineages, including deﬁnitive endoderm10, hepatocytes11 and endothelial cells (ECs)12.
 Moreover, previous work has shown that changes in bulk cell density (i.e., the number of hPSCs per
 culture medium volume) in the presence of CHIR can shift the primitive streak-like priming of
 hPSCs, forming either deﬁnitive endoderm or presomitic mesoderm instead of pre-cardiac meso-
 derm. Thus, ‘simple’ WNT pathway induction results in broad developmental potential13,14.

 Comparison with other methods to model heart tissue formation
 A variety of studies on in vitro models of heart tissue formation have been published. However, other
 groups’ work has mainly focused on the engineering of hPSC-derived or primary cardiac cell types,
 including cardiomyocytes, ECs and ﬁbroblasts, into (adult-like) heart tissue models15–21. In contrast
 to the HFO approach, key aspects of native heart development were not mimicked by these studies.
 Models of heart development have been published by Ma et al.22 and Hoang et al.23, who generated
 ‘cardiac microchambers’ by geometric conﬁnement of hPSCs, and by Andersen et al.24, who derived
 ‘precardiac organoids’ from mouse PSCs. Although these models do mimic aspects of cardiogenesis,
 they do not reﬂect the complex spatiotemporal patterns of early heart development, which occurs in
 interplay with foregut endoderm formation. Overcoming this issue, Rossi et al.25 have recently
 described a method for inducing cardiogenesis in gastruloids derived from mouse PSCs. This type of
 organoid comprises cardiac progenitors self-organizing into a heart tube-like domain, which is
 separated from a primitive gut-like tube by an endocardial-like layer. Importantly, however, in
 contrast to any other in vitro model, our hPSC-derived HFOs show the highly organized co-
 development of heart and anterior versus PFE anlagen in combination with endocardium and
 vascular-like network formation. This structure is a result of the exact interplay of several deﬁned
 cues combined with Matrigel encapsulation and WNT pathway modulation as described above, and
 will promote novel mechanistic studies of human organogenesis in vitro.

 Applications of the protocol
 HFOs represent a model system of human heart, foregut and vascular network formation at early
 developmental stages. Given that HFO generation is highly robust and relatively fast and can be
 applied to different hPSC lines, HFOs represent a potent tool to investigate a broad range of basic and
 translational questions. For example, HFOs can be used to study genetic defects in vitro. We have
 demonstrated this by generating NKX2.5 knock-out HFOs, which had malformations of heart
 development similar to those observed in transgenic mice6. The co-differentiation of several cell
 lineages in HFOs, which co-develop in the embryo in a similar way, enables the simultaneous
 monitoring of effects caused by, for example, genetic mutations that differentially impact on the
 distinct lineages. We also anticipate that HFOs could serve as an advanced platform for pharma-
 cological studies, including drug screening as well as teratogenicity and toxicity assays, which should
 help to identify substances and mechanisms causing tissue- and organ-speciﬁc birth defects.

Fig. 2 | Schematic illustration of the HFO differentiation from hPSCs. HFO formation is initiated on differentiation day minus 4 (d-4) from hPSCs
grown in 2D monolayers coming from MEF cultures (Steps 1A–9) or from a monolayer frozen stock (Steps 1B–9). On d-4, 5,000 cells are seeded per
well of an ultra-low attachment 96-U-well plate, followed by centrifugation to form one hPSC aggregate per well (Steps 10–13). On d-2, aggregates are
individually embedded in Matrigel droplets (Steps 14–21) followed by differentiation using the small molecules CHIR99021 and IWP2 (Steps 22–27).
HFO differentiation is completed on d10 (Step 28). Before proceeding with further experiments, HFOs should be assessed under an inverted
microscope (to observe the HFOs from the culture plate bottom) to ensure proper patterning. Analysis of HFOs can be performed by various methods,
including staining and imaging, scRNAseq or ﬂow cytometry (Steps 31–46). t-SNE, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.


 Limitations
 As noted above, HFOs recapitulate well-established patterns of early embryogenesis. However, there
 are distinct differences compared with native heart and foregut development. In contrast to the
 embryo, HFOs do not comprise a continuous, single foregut tube but display two spatially distinct
 anterior versus posterior foregut endoderm compartments. The heart anlage in HFOs is thus located
 between these foregut-like tissues rather than ventrally to the foregut tube as in the embryo. A further
 limitation of the model is the incomplete patterning of the heart anlage, which results in detection of
 second heart ﬁeld-like cells in HFOs only, with an absence of ﬁrst heart ﬁeld-like cell patterns6.
 Moreover, it has to be considered that the modeling capabilities of HFOs are so far limited to very
 early developmental stages only. Later events such as heart tube formation, looping and cardiac
 chamber development are not recapitulated by the current model. Also, the two foregut endoderm
 compartments comprise immature tissue. Further protocol development to further maturation will
 thus be required to advance the model since HFOs seem to degenerate upon long-term cultivation
 under the current culture conditions6.


 Experimental design
 Prior to commencing the protocol, hPSCs must be derived by established monolayer culture8,26.
 HFOs are generated by seeding 5,000 hPSCs per well of an ultra-low attachment 96-U-well plate on
 ‘differentiation day minus 4’ (d-4) followed by centrifugation to form one aggregate per well. After 2 d
 of cultivation (on d-2), these aggregates are individually embedded in Matrigel droplets. Another 2 d
 later (on d0), induction of directed differentiation is initiated by CHIR supplementation until d1
 followed by IWP2 treatment (d3–d5); on d10, HFO differentiation is completed. The HFO differ-
 entiation protocol is schematically outlined in Fig. 2 and explained in detail below. Although no
 special skills or equipment are needed to implement the protocol, it requires practice and attention to

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 details. All steps have to be followed precisely to ensure a successful outcome. We therefore
 recommend a couple of practice runs prior to applying the protocol for investigating speciﬁc ques-
 tions. Based on our experience, we anticipate that a person with ~6–12 months of cell culture
 experience should be able to perform the protocol, including successful HFO formation and sub-
 sequent analysis.
 For protocol adaptations such as the use of other cell lines (such as novel reporter, knock-out or
 patient-speciﬁc iPSC lines) or speciﬁc compound treatment (such as growth factors, pharmacological
 compounds, etc.) during differentiation, we recommend the following:
 ● Any new cell line needs to be tested. Although HFOs have been successfully derived from human


 embryonic stem cell and iPSC lines using this protocol without modiﬁcations, it is possible that some
 cell lines may require adaptations concerning, for example, the initial cell number seeded for aggregate
 formation or modulation of the CHIR concentration used to initiate differentiation
 ● Although the protocol is robust, we recommend the induction of more HFOs than actually needed for


 the experiment. This will ensure that enough successfully formed HFO samples and relevant repeats
 will be available to enable the reliable experimental analysis and interpretation. This will also account
 for potential variation or even loss of HFOs due to experimental failure such as mechanical damaging
 of HFOs during the pipetting steps. Only successfully formed, properly patterned HFOs should be used
 for subsequent analyses
 ● It is important that appropriate controls are included within each experiment, such as untreated HFOs


 or HFOs derived from the respective nontargeted wild-type cell line, if applicable. Moreover, before
 drawing conclusions about the potential impact of an experimental treatment on HFO pattern
 formation, robust intra- and interexperimental repeats are required to substantiate novel results
 ●
 HFOs must be fully characterized. Analysis of HFOs can be performed by different methods such as
 whole-mount immunoﬂuorescence (IF) staining and microscopy, histology, gene expression studies
 and ﬂow cytometry of dissociated HFOs, for which we provide a detailed protocol below. However, it
 should be noted that every new analytical method will require establishment and thorough validation
 to comply with the speciﬁc requirements of the different tissues in HFOs, which show differential
 cell–cell adhesion properties, tissue density, etc. Thus, every method has to be critically validated
 regarding its suitability for every cell/tissue type in HFOs and with respect to the respective stage of
 HFO differentiation

 cells. Transfer the resulting cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube, and centrifuge the tube at 300g
 for 3 min at 4 °C.
 4 Remove the supernatant, and gently resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of E8 + 10 μM Y27632.
 5 Count the cells and assess the cell viability by applying Trypan blue staining in a hemocytometer
 using standard methods (and previously described33).
 6 Take a prepared Geltrex-coated T25 ﬂask, aspirate the medium and add 5 mL E8 + 10 μM Y27632.

 and forth and left to right at the point where it is placed in the incubator to ensure that the cells are
 equally distributed (Supplementary Video 1).
 CRITICAL STEP The optimal seeding density has to be identiﬁed for every hPSC line as
 c


 previously described8,26. An appropriate seeding density is one that results in a conﬂuent
 monolayer of cells after 3–4 d of culture.
 8 Change the medium after 2 d and then daily by aspirating the medium and adding 5 mL of fresh E8
 (Y27632 is only required for cell seeding and so is not needed).
 9 After 3–4 d, the hPSCs will have formed a conﬂuent monolayer; passage again by repeating
 Steps 2–8.
 CRITICAL STEP For hPSCs precultured on MEFs (Step 1, option A), the cells have to be passaged
 c


 at least four times in monolayer culture on Geltrex to ensure complete depletion of MEFs before
 initiation of the HFO differentiation protocol.
 CRITICAL STEP For hPSCs inoculated from a monolayer-derived frozen stock (Step 1, option B),
 c


 we recommend at least two passages in monolayer culture before initiation of the HFO
 differentiation protocol.
 CRITICAL STEP We recommend maintaining hPSCs on MEFs and regularly starting a new
 c


 monolayer culture from there. Do not exceed eight passages in monolayer culture. We also
 recommend assessing the pluripotency of the cells regularly as previously described8.


 Generation of HFOs from hPSCs
 d-4: cell seeding and aggregate formation ● Timing 45 min
 CRITICAL HFO formation starts with a preculture period designated as day minus 4 (d-4) until
 c


 d-1; this comprises hPSC seeding, aggregate formation and Matrigel embedding, followed by the actual
 differentiation controlled by CHIR and IWP2 supplementation from d0 to d10 (Fig. 2). The timing
 listed for this and the following sections is for parallel formation of 36 HFOs (in three rows of a
 96-U-well plate).
 10 Detach hPSCs (from Step 9; at an appropriate passage) at 80–90% conﬂuence from a T25 by
 Accutase treatment, and count the cells as described in Steps 2–5.
 11 Prepare a stock cell suspension at a concentration of 5,000 cells per 100 µL medium by adding an
 appropriate amount of cells from Step 10 (based on the desired number of HFOs) to E8 + 10 μM
 Y27632. Gently resuspend the cells.
 CRITICAL STEP If aiming for a certain amount of HFOs, we recommend to seed 12 wells more
 c


 than would actually be required for the respective experiment to take into account potential loss of
 aggregates during the differentiation or failed differentiation of some HFOs. For example
 calculations, see Table 1.
 CRITICAL STEP An excess of 10–20% of the stock cell suspension is also recommended, which
 c


 facilitates proper pipetting and resuspension of the cells. For example calculations, see Table 1.

 CRITICAL STEP Seeding an appropriate cell number is critical. For all tested cell lines, 5,000 cells
 c


 per well resulted in the successful formation of HFOs. Perform the cell counting with the
 hemocytometer carefully, and ensure proper preparation of the stock cell suspension. Ensure gentle
 but thorough resuspension of the cells in the culture medium to distribute the cells evenly.
 12 Seed 100 µL of the stock cell suspension per well of a U-shaped ultra-low attachment 96-well plate.
 Seed 12 wells (one row) more than the number of desired HFOs (Table 1).
 CRITICAL STEP After each row, pipet the remaining stock suspension up and down to
 c


 ensure homogeneous resuspension of the cells and thus the correct cell number in each well
 seeded afterward.
 13 Centrifuge the plate at 300g and 4 °C for 3 min to bring the cells to the culture plate bottom, and

 CRITICAL STEP Ensure that, after centrifugation, the hPSCs form a round cell pellet at the
 c


 culture plate bottom as shown in Fig. 4a. Place the plate into the incubator very carefully, and do
 not move it for at least 24 h to ensure that one round aggregate will form per well overnight.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING

 d-2: Matrigel embedding of hPSC aggregates ● Timing 2 h
 CRITICAL Two days after seeding (d-2), the hPSC aggregates are embedded in Matrigel droplets.
 c


 14 Before you start, take out the required amount of Matrigel aliquots from the freezer and let them
 thaw on ice. When the Matrigel is thawed, insert the aliquots into the ice. Take out the sterile
 scissors (heated to at least 180 °C for at least 3 h), and let them cool down at room temperature.
 CRITICAL STEP Ensure the Matrigel is not growth-factor-reduced (use cat. no. 354234) and has
 c


 an appropriate protein concentration; HFO formation has been validated with a Matrigel
 concentration range of 9.7–10.7 mg/mL. Do not use Geltrex instead of Matrigel since this will result
 in a failed differentiation based on our experience6.
 15 In the meantime, take a look at the 96-U-well plate under the microscope to check if the hPSC
 aggregates have properly formed. Mark the properly formed aggregates (these will be further
 embedded in Matrigel) and cross out the rest (not round or too small aggregates; see Fig. 4b for
 examples; these aggregates can be discarded later).
 CRITICAL STEP Embedding only properly formed aggregates (round, homogeneous,
 c


 ~550–650 µm in diameter) is important.

 16 Take a 2–20 µL pipet, cut off a piece of the tip holding the scissors at a ~90° angle relative to the tip,
 and set the pipet to 3 µL (this pipet will be used to pick the aggregates). Take a 10–100 µL pipet (or
 equivalent) and set it to 20 µL (this pipet will be used for making the Matrigel droplets). The
 aggregates will be embedded in the Matrigel droplets one by one.
 CRITICAL STEP The timing of HFO differentiation (starting time points) on the different days is
 c


 critical. Begin with Step 16 4–5 h later than the time point at which Step 10 has been started on d-4.
 See Table 2 for details.
 CRITICAL STEP Form one Matrigel droplet and embed one aggregate at a time to prevent
 c


 premature solidiﬁcation of the Matrigel.
 17 Pipet 20 µL of Matrigel into an empty well of the 96-U-well plate.
 CRITICAL STEP Depress the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop and discard the residual
 c


 volume to ensure that no air bubbles will be introduced into the Matrigel droplet. Bubbles within
 the droplets or the culture medium will cause the Matrigel droplets with the embedded aggregates
 to ﬂoat during the differentiation process, which will result in a failed differentiation. Make sure the
 Matrigel is pipetted very slowly.
 18 Pick a properly formed aggregate. To do this, use the cut tip (from Step 16), hold the plate almost
 perpendicularly and aspirate the aggregate. It might be easier to see the aggregates if a background
 is created, for example by placing a pipet tip box behind the plate.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 19 Insert the aggregate into the Matrigel droplet by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst
 stop to prevent the formation of bubbles. Place the lid onto the plate, and check visually if the aggregate
 is inside the droplet by carefully tilting the plate and looking at the Matrigel droplet from the plate
 bottom. Steps 16–19 are shown in Supplementary Video 2 and are schematically depicted in Fig. 4c.
 CRITICAL STEP It is important not to transfer too much culture medium with the aggregate into
 c


 the droplet (not more than 6 µL) to prevent dilution of the Matrigel. Thus, if embedding of an
 aggregate in one speciﬁc Matrigel droplet fails twice, do not continue with this droplet but rather
 make a new one.
 20 Repeat Steps 17–19 until all aggregates are embedded. Use a new tip for every Matrigel droplet. The
 cut tip does not necessarily have to be changed. Afterward, place the plate into the incubator for
 50–60 min to let the Matrigel solidify.
 21 Add 100 µL E8 per well. A multichannel pipet can be used in this step. Add the medium slowly and
 carefully, depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop to prevent damage and ﬂoating
 of the Matrigel droplets. Place the plate back into the incubator.

 c


 22 Remove the culture medium from the wells without aspirating or damaging the Matrigel droplets
 with the aggregates. We have used two methods and recommend users try out both methods to
 identify the most suitable.
 CRITICAL STEP Begin this step at approximately the same time of day that you started Step 16 on

 d-2 (Table 2). It is important that all of the culture medium containing CHIR is removed from the
 wells; this step should be repeated if necessary.

 (A) Removing the culture medium with 1,000 µL and 200 µL tips
 (i) Hold the culture plate at a 45° angle. Use a 100–1,000 µL pipet to remove the culture
 medium above the Matrigel droplet until the droplet is exposed. Alternatively, a 20–200 µL
 pipet (or equivalent) can be used. Work carefully and slowly. It might be easier to see the
 Matrigel droplets with the aggregates if a background is created, for example by placing a
 pipet tip box behind the plate.
 (ii) To remove the rest of the medium around and below the Matrigel droplet, use a 20–200 µL
 pipet (or equivalent). Gently press the Matrigel droplet down to the wall of the well with
 the pipet tip.
 (iii) While aspirating the medium, move the pipet tip in a half-circle close to the well wall as
 schematically depicted in Fig. 5a and shown in Supplementary Video 3. Repeat this step, if
 the entire medium has not been removed from the well.
 (B) Removing the culture medium with stacked tips
 (i) Use a 20–200 µL pipet (or equivalent), and stack a 10 µL tip (autoclaved at 120 °C for
 20 min) on a 200 µL tip as shown in Fig. 5b.
 (ii) Carefully aspirate the medium as described in Step 22, option A. See also
 Supplementary Video 4.
 23 Switch off the lights and prepare RB− supplemented with 7.5 µM CHIR. Add 200 µL RB−/CHIR per well
 by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop. Place the plate back into the incubator.
 CRITICAL STEP CHIR is light-sensitive. Ensure the lights are switched off to work.
 c c


 CRITICAL STEP The culture medium volume during the CHIR treatment is critical, since the
 differentiation outcome is dependent on the correct bulk cell density14. Ensure pipetting is accurate,
 and add the medium to one well at a time. Do not use a multichannel pipet.
 CRITICAL STEP Note the time at which you end CHIR addition as the medium containing CHIR
 c


 has to be exchanged after 24 h (Table 2).
 CRITICAL STEP From this day onward, start monitoring the morphology of the developing
 c


 HFOs. An example is shown in Fig. 5c. Table 3 presents the expected size range of a developing
 HFO during the differentiation. However, cell-line-dependent variations may occur without
 indication of differentiation failure.

 CRITICAL STEP Since CHIR is light-sensitive, on d0, observe the aggregates under a microscope
 c


 before the medium change to prevent damage of the CHIR.
 24 24 h later (d1, Fig. 5c), remove the culture medium carefully as described in Step 22 and add 200 µL
 RB− per well by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop. The medium can be
 added using a multichannel pipet. Then, place the plate back into the incubator and start
 monitoring the morphology of the Matrigel droplets from this day onward.
 CRITICAL STEP Removing the culture medium containing CHIR precisely after 24 h is very
 c


 important. Although a delay of a maximum of 30 min did not have an adverse effect in our cell lines
 (Table 2), other cell lines might react more sensitively to a prolonged CHIR incubation time.
 CRITICAL STEP Ensure the entire culture medium containing CHIR is removed from the wells.
 c


 Repeat Step 22 if necessary.
 CRITICAL STEP Damaging the Matrigel droplets during the medium changes (Fig. 5d) might
 c


 cause the aggregates to drop out of the droplets (Fig. 5e), which will result in failed differentiation.
 To prevent this, ensure careful and slow pipetting during the medium changes.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 25 Two days later (d3, Fig. 5c), prepare RB− supplemented with 5 µM IWP2. Remove the culture
 medium carefully from the plate as described in Step 22, and add 200 µL RB−/IWP2 per well by
 depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop. The medium can be added using a
 multichannel pipet. Place the plate back into the incubator.
 CRITICAL STEP Begin this step at approximately the same time of day Step 22 was started on d0.
 c


 Note the end time point as the medium containing IWP2 has to be exchanged after 48 h (Table 2).
 26 48 h later (d5, Fig. 5c), remove the culture medium carefully (by repeating Step 22) and add 200 µL
 RB− per well by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop. A multichannel pipet
 can be used to add the medium. Place the plate back into the incubator afterward.
 CRITICAL STEP The culture medium containing IWP2 has to be removed after 48 h. Ideally, stay
 c


 on time; however, we found a delay of maximum 1 h did not have an adverse effect (Table 2).
 27 Two days later (d7, Fig. 5c), remove the culture medium (by repeating Step 22) and add 200 µL RB
 + per well by depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop. The medium can be added
 using a multichannel pipet. This medium change can be performed at any time point (Table 2).
 Place the plate back into the incubator until d10 (the medium can but does not have to be changed
 on d8 and d9).
 CRITICAL STEP Although the timing is not important on d7, we recommend changing the
 c


 medium in the afternoon if a medium change on d8 or d9 is not planned.

 with any further experiments. Choose an appropriate magniﬁcation to see the entire HFO (in the
 front view, HFOs have a diameter of ~1.5–2 mm). If the HFOs have been generated using cells

 CRITICAL STEP Use only successfully formed HFOs for any further experiments since only these
 c


 HFOs will be properly patterned and contain all relevant cell lineages (Fig. 1)6. Using the HES3
 NKX2.5-eGFP reporter line28, in which cardiomyocytes express eGFP, successfully formed HFOs
 show a clear, layered pattern in the front view consisting of an IC comprising NKX2.5-eGFP-
 negative cells, an ML showing NKX2.5-eGFP-positive cells and an OL with both NKX2.5-eGFP-
 positive and -negative cells as shown in Fig. 6a, upper row and 6b. In contrast, aggregates not
 showing such layered pattern (Fig. 6a, bottom row) should be discarded. Notably, the three layers
 are also visible without the eGFP reporter in the bright-ﬁeld mode in the front view as shown in Fig.
 6c with the HES3 NKX2.5-eGFP line28 as well as the iPSC lines hHSC_Iso4_ADCF_SeV-iPS230 and
 iPSC-CB1RB9_WAS-GFP31. It will be easier to see the layers in the bright-ﬁeld mode, if the light
 intensity and/or the contrast are increased (Fig. 6c, middle and bottom rows). Note that the IC in
 the iPSC-CB1RB9_WAS-GFP HFO (Fig. 6c) is off-center because the HFO is slightly rotated. Since
 the OL contains mainly loose tissue, it may partially fuse into dense structures (for example, note
 the tail-like extension in the OL of the iPSC-CB1RB9_WAS-GFP HFO; Fig. 6c). Rotated HFOs and
 HFOs with dense structures in the OL are still considered successfully formed as long as the three
 layers are visible.

 29 If required, maintain the HFOs in culture in the 96-U-well plate in RB+. HFOs can be cultured for
 a maximum of another 2 weeks. Change the medium every 2–3 d by removing the old medium as
 described in Step 22 and adding 200 µL RB+ per well.
 30 If subsequent analysis requires removal of the HFOs from the 96-U-well plate, use a 100–1,000 µL
 pipet and cut off a piece of the pipet tip with sterile scissors holding them at a ~90° angle relative to
 the tip. Hold the plate at a 45° angle, and insert the pipet tip perpendicularly into the well. Ensure
 tight attachment of the edge of the tip to the well bottom while aspirating the HFO. The transfer of
 an HFO from the 96-U-well plate to a 12-well suspension plate is shown in Supplementary Video 5

 Dissociation of HFOs for replating or further analysis
 31 To dissociate and stain HFOs for subsequent ﬂow cytometry analysis, follow option A. A variation
 of the dissociation process is required to dissociate HFOs for subsequent single-cell RNA
 sequencing (scRNAseq) or replating of dissociated cells (for example, for subsequent patch clamp
 analysis), as described in option B.
 (A) Dissociation and staining of HFOs in a 96-well format for subsequent ﬂow cytometry
 analysis ● Timing 2 h
 (i) Set the thermomixer to 37 °C, and ensure that it is prewarmed before you start the
 dissociation of the HFOs.
 (ii) Transfer the HFOs from the 96-U-well plate to a V-shaped 96-well plate as described in
 Step 30 (one HFO per well).
 (iii) Carefully remove the rest of the culture medium as described in Step 22 (removing the
 medium from a V-shaped well requires the same procedure that is used for a
 U-shaped well).
 (iv) Wash the HFOs with 200 µL of PBS w/o per well (to wash, add PBS w/o and remove
 it again).
 (v) Thaw an aliquot of STEMdiff Cardiomyocyte Dissociation Medium at 37 °C in a water
 bath. Add 100 µL of the STEMdiff Cardiomyocyte Dissociation Medium per well, and
 cover the plate with sealing ﬁlm.

Anticipated results
 This protocol provides a method for the robust differentiation of HFOs from hPSCs. After some
 experience and accurate execution of the protocol, with established hPSC lines, ~90% of properly
 patterned HFOs should be obtained in each experiment6 (Fig. 7a). Proper patterning can be deter-
 mined by using the HES3 NKX2.5-eGFP reporter line and is identiﬁed by the formation of three
 layers in HFOs: the IC (comprising NKX2.5-eGFP-negative cells), the ML (NKX2.5-eGFP-positive
 cells) and the OL (NKX2.5-eGFP-positive and -negative cells) as shown in Fig. 6a,b. Notably, these
 layers can also be distinctly identiﬁed without the eGFP reporter contrast using conventional bright-
 ﬁeld microscopy (Fig. 6c). This assessment demonstrated that HFOs can be successfully generated for
 the established iPSC lines hHSC_Iso4_ADCF_SeV-iPS26,30 and iPSC-CB1RB9_WAS-GFP31 (Fig. 6c)
 as well as with several HES3-based (reporter) cell lines6. Figure 7a shows the HFO differentiation
 efﬁciencies for the abovementioned cell lines as well as for the HES3 MIXL1-GFP reporter line6,29,
 revealing similar efﬁciencies as for the HES3 NKX2.5-eGFP cell line.
 As noted above, only successfully formed HFOs showing the three morphologically distinct layers
 in the front view should be used for any subsequent analyses; only properly patterned HFOs com-
 prising heart and foregut anlagen as well as the vascular-like network will be informative for any
 envisioned assay. A cellular composition of ~40% cardiomyocytes (located in the ML and OL),
 ~4–5% ECs (distributed throughout the HFO but mainly found in the IC), ~20% AFE (located in the
 IC) and 10–15% liver progenitors/PFE (found in the OL, Fig. 1) is usually obtained. This can be
 identiﬁed by complementary scRNAseq and ﬂow cytometry assessment for relative cell type quan-
 tiﬁcation and morphologically observed by IF staining of numerous d13 HFOs6. The different tissues
 of HFOs can be analyzed by IF by staining with antibodies for cell-type-speciﬁc markers. Those
 include myosin heavy chain (MHC) or cardiac troponin T (cTnT) for cardiomyocytes (Fig. 7b,f,g),
 vimentin for mesenchymal cells (Fig. 7b), CD31 for endothelial and endocardial cells (Fig. 7c,d),
 SOX17 for endoderm (Fig. 7e), SOX2 for AFE (Fig. 7f) and HNF4α for liver progenitors/PFE (Fig.
 7g). Notably, the two endodermal compartments can be easily identiﬁed by their morphology
 (aggregate-like appearance of the PFE and cavity-forming AFE) without the requirement for tissue-
 speciﬁc IF staining (Fig. 7b–g).

Fig. 8 | Gating strategy for a ﬂow cytometry analysis of an HFO. Double-staining of a d13 HES3 NKX2.5-eGFP-derived HFO with directly conjugated
antibodies against cTnT (cardiomyocytes) and CD31 (ECs). The ﬂow cytometry plots were generated with FlowJo V10. SSC-A, side scatter area; FSC-
A, forward scatter area; FSC-H, forward scatter height.

 The tissues of HFOs have different physiological and physical properties, requiring distinct
 methodological approaches for proper analysis. Therefore, all methods applied for HFO analysis such
 as tissue dissociation, ﬁxation, staining, imaging or RNA extraction may require adaptations of the
 respective standard protocols to ensure meaningful results (see ref. 6).
 In this protocol, we provide a procedure for the dissociation and staining of individual HFOs in a
 96-well format followed by ﬂow cytometry, which is an excellent way to quantitatively analyze the
 tissue composition of HFOs (Steps 31–46). Figure 8 shows the gating strategy for a ﬂow cytometry
 analysis of a d13 HES3 NKX2.5-eGFP-derived HFO simultaneously stained with antibodies against
 cTnT and CD31 to mark cardiomyocytes and ECs, respectively. Following the gating of living cells
 and doublet exclusion, the analyzed HFO shows ~38% NKX2.5-eGFP-positive cells (the eGFP signal
 is preserved upon ﬁxation and staining using the Fix & Perm kit), ~36% cTnT-positive cardio-
 myocytes and ~4.5% CD31-positive ECs, consistent with our previously published results6.
