Therefore, microbes are being evaluated as potential\n treatments for colorectal diseases. Humanized model systems that enable robust culture of primary human intestinal\n cells with bacteria facilitate evaluation of potential treatments. Here, we describe a protocol that can be used to coculture\n a primary human colon monolayer with aerotolerant bacteria. Primary human colon cells maintained as organoids are\n dispersed into single-cell suspensions and then seeded on collagen-coated Transwell inserts, where they attach\n and proliferate to form conﬂuent monolayers within days of seeding. The conﬂuent monolayers are differentiated for an\n additional 4 d and then cocultured with bacteria. As an example application, we describe how to coculture differentiated\n colon cells for 8 h with four strains of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, each engineered to detect different colonic\n1234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;\n\n\n microenvironments via genetically embedded logic circuits incorporating deoxycholic acid and anhydrotetracycline\n sensors. Characterization of this coculture system reveals that barrier function remains intact in the presence\n of engineered B. thetaiotaomicron. The bacteria stay close to the mucus layer and respond in a microenvironment-\n speciﬁc manner to the inducers (deoxycholic acid and anhydrotetracycline) of the genetic circuits. This protocol thus\n provides a useful mucosal barrier system to assess the effects of bacterial cells that respond to the colonic\n microenvironment, and may also be useful in other contexts to model human intestinal barrier properties and\n microbiota–host interactions.\n\n\n Introduction\n Genetically engineered and unmodiﬁed microbes have great potential to treat chronic diseases\n by impacting host physiology. Comprehensive evaluation of the performance of these potentially\n therapeutic microbes is critical and requires both in vitro and in vivo models. The US Food and Drug\n Administration supports the use of gut simulators to provide evidence for a claimed beneﬁcial\n bacterial effect, e.g., Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME)1–4. These\n luminal microbial culture systems provide reproducible experiments, however, lack critical compo-\n nents of host–microbe interactions involving bacterial adhesion to, or entrainment in, epithelial-\n associated mucus; direct attachment to epithelial cells; and reaction to epithelial-secreted signaling\n molecules. To study the communication of bacteria with host mucosal barrier cells and evaluate\n attachment to cells and/or cell-produced mucus, various in vitro gut models have been developed.\n These gut models use either immortalized human cancer cell lines or primary cells expanded as\n organoids, in static cultures or continuous microﬂuidic systems5–8, and have proved useful to\n study drug transport and drug delivery6–9.\n In this protocol, we describe how to generate primary human colon monolayers in a standard\n cell culture membrane insert (Transwell) using colon proliferative cells previously maintained as\n organoids (Fig. 1). We provide detailed instructions for the passaging and expansion of the colon\n organoids, as well as detailed instructions for cell seeding and differentiation.

Sampling refers to the collection of apical\n medium containing bacteria as described in detail in Steps 98–100 and in the original publication10. In the coculture\n experiments we previously conducted10, engineered B. thetaiotaomicron MT798, MT799 and MT800 were used.\n Each strain carried a genetic circuit with designed response to inducers aTc (an antibiotic analog) and/or DCA (a\n secondary bile acid in human colon). As a control, B. thetaiotaomicron (MT768) engineered with constant expression\n of luminescence was used. TEER measurement is optional, but we recommend it be performed at key timepoints\n (e.g., D7, D10 and D14), particularly prior to coculture with bacteria at D14 and after medium collection at D14.

For example, in a previous publication, we fed\n mice with Bacteroides engineered with an inducible gene circuit, then measured the bacterial indu-\n cible response (luciferase activity) in the feces14. However, using this approach, it was difﬁcult to\n characterize the detailed performance of the bacterial genetic circuit within the mice, in part because\n of difﬁculties visualizing bacterial adherence to the small intestinal/colon epithelium15.\n Animal experiments are also low-throughput and expensive, and the method of bacterial\n administration (for example by gavage) adds complexity in the procedure. Further, animals and\n humans differ in their physiology, diet, mucus composition, mucosal immunology, molecular\n transport and native microbiota composition, all of which can radically impact bacterial biology16,17.\n Such differences can make it difﬁcult to extrapolate the performance of an engineered bacterium from\n an animal model to humans (https://investor.synlogictx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/\n synlogic-discontinues-development-synb1020-treat-hyperammonemia)12. Evaluating bacterial per-\n formance in humans, however, is even slower and convoluted because of patient-to-patient variability\n and issues involving regulatory compliance. Thus, the ability to evaluate the performance of engi-\n neered bacteria in an in vitro model that mimics critical features of the human colonic environment\n relevant for the bacterial circuits in question is desirable. In contrast to animal models, in vitro\n gut models enable fast turnover (i.e., 2–4 weeks for monolayer preparation in Transwells) and\n intermediate throughput (16 Transwells or more per week).\n The cellular, geometry and operation capabilities of in vitro gut models can be varied to simulate\n human gut biology. For instance, an in vitro gut model can include an epithelial monolayer in\n combination with neuronal and immune cells by using either commercial cell lines or tissue-derived\n primary cells with static or dynamic mechanical stimulation, which appears to promote mucus and\n villus-like structures6–9. Native gut microbiota, such as Bacteroides spp., can be introduced into such\n devices for hours to weeks, depending on the culture conﬁguration and luminal medium exchange\n rates, to enable mechanistic studies to better understand the effects of the microbiota18–26. Two-\n dimensional culture of epithelial monolayers or bilayers with supporting cells in standardized\n Transwell inserts are often used for evaluating drug interactions with human colon because of the\n easy access to both luminal and basal compartments27–32; however, these have not been widely\n deployed to test engineered bacteria safety and performance. These intestinal models were tradi-\n tionally developed using commercially available cell lines33, and recently expanded to use primary\n rodent and human small intestinal cells as a starting material27–32.\n More complex in vitro gut models that require highly specialized apparatus or 3D architecture19–21,24,34–37\n have also been developed but are often tailored for narrow and speciﬁc applications. For example,\n Jalili-Firoozinezhad et al. designed a customized anaerobic chamber that enables the culture of\n obligate anaerobes in two-channel microﬂuidic gut-on-a-chip24. In another customized microﬂuidics-\n based gut model (HuMiX), Shah et al. created two microchambers separated by a nanoporous\n membrane to prevent intestinal cells from direct contact with bacterial cells during coculture\n experiments21. Unfortunately, the complexity of the gut devices makes them impractical for routine\n use in all but a few dedicated laboratories and are not always generalizable to desired readouts.\n Simpliﬁed gut models using Transwell-type inserts have been used for a variety of applications,\n including drug screening27, drug toxicity28, drug transport30, cytokine secretion38, host–parasite\n interactions29, host–pathogen interactions39,40 and host–norovirus interactions41,42. Because the luminal\n side of the epithelial monolayer in Transwell culture is completely accessible, it is easy to introduce\n bacteria, add any stimuli and collect samples over multiple time points. Therefore, monolayer cultures\n can be scaled up to screen multiple conditions and bacterial strains with substantially higher throughput\n than animal models. A drawback of static monolayer models is the inability to maintain a super-strict\n anaerobic luminal environment or a constant supply of nutrients, making it difﬁcult to establish long-\n term stable cocultures owing to short life span of host cells18 and bacterial overgrowth20. While the\n oxygen concentration at the surface of an epithelial monolayer in a static Transwell in the presence of\n bacteria can approach microaerobic or even moderately anaerobic states43, static monolayers are\n therefore limited in application to aerobes and aerotolerant anaerobes. This limitation can be overcome\n by combining the Transwell monolayer model with microphysiological systems technology20,26,43.\n Gut organoid models have emerged as a new tool to study host–microbe interactions44. The\n culture of organoids from primary human and animal intestinal tissues enables the routine\n maintenance of intestinal organoids from different donors27,44–46. In addition to tissue-derived\n organoids, intestinal organoids can also be derived from human pluripotent stem cells, although the\n differentiation requires up to 4 weeks and does not recapitulate features of adult tissue47,48.\n\n3876 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | AUGUST 2021 | 3874–3900 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n Table 1 | Application of the protocol to different donors that varied in age, sex and colon biopsy region\n\n Donor no.

In\n addition, in organoid cultures, antibiotics must be added into the culture medium to keep the\n basolateral side free from bacteria49, resulting in alterations to intestinal function that are indepen-\n dent of antimicrobial activity50.\n To utilize the strengths of the organoid and monolayer systems, while also overcoming some of the\n limitations discussed above, we and other researchers developed methods to generate primary human\n colon monolayers in a standard cell culture membrane insert (Transwell) from colon proliferative\n cells previously maintained as organoids10,27,29,51,52. This protocol generates primary human colon\n epithelial monolayers that contain differentiated and proliferative cells. The monolayers exhibit\n physical and biological barrier functions as indicated by an increase in transepithelial electrical\n resistance (TEER) values over time. In contrast to other systems19–21,24,34,35, the open conﬁguration of\n the Transwell allows access to both the apical and basolateral sides of the epithelium for the\n incorporation of bacterial cells engineered with genetic circuits and their corresponding inducers at\n different time points during a given experiment.\n\n\n Applications of the protocol\n Human gut models can provide a physiological environment for testing safety and efﬁcacy of bio-\n logics before progressing to animal or human trials53. For instance, engineered bacteria with inducible\n gene circuits can be validated in standard bacterial culture conditions and then tested for efﬁcacy in\n an in vitro gut model. We recently employed this strategy to test engineered bacteria with gene\n circuits that respond to different colon microenvironments, using a primary human colon mucosal\n barrier in a static culture conﬁguration10. Further, gut models can be combined with physiomimetic/\n microﬂuidic systems technology to recapitulate complex multicellular crosstalk. For example, we\n recently used a physiomimetic platform to study the crosstalk between primary human colon epi-\n thelial cells with oxygen-intolerant commensal Faecalibacterium prausnitzii26. In addition, we also\n built a physiomimetic platform to study multicellular crosstalk among gut–liver–immune cells in the\n context of ulcerative colitis52.\n The methods described here have been used to successfully expand organoids from donors of\n different sex, age, colon regions and disease state (mainly ulcerative colitis) (Table 1); thus, we\n anticipate that this method could be extended to other human intestinal tissues (e.g., small intestine)\n and other understudied mucosal barriers, such as oral cavity, endocervix and endometrium. Indeed,\n the organoid and monolayer technique has been successfully applied to stem-cell-derived small\n intestinal enteroids41 to study host–virus interactions in different microenvironments54. In addition,\n we anticipate that this protocol can be adopted to study a variety of other important topics in mucosal\n epithelial biology, including host–pathogen interactions, drug absorption and toxicity in the context\n of personalized medicine.\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | AUGUST 2021 | 3874–3900 | www.nature.com/nprot 3877\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n Box 1 | EDU staining to determine the proliferative state of the monolayer ● Timing setup 1 h, incubation 1 d, imaging 0.5 h\n After Step 75, EdU staining can be performed to determine the proportion of proliferative cells.

If you wish to store monolayers for longer than a week before imaging, mount on glass microscope slides as described in\n Steps 114–120.\n\n\n Experimental design\n The procedure comprises several stages (Fig. 1) that start with established organoids in 3D culture.\n We ﬁrst describe how to maintain, passage and expand organoids, and then we describe how\n organoids are dissociated to generate single cells for seeding into Transwells inserts and generating\n functional colon monolayers. Finally, we outline the medium regime to differentiate epithelial\n monolayers prior to the addition of bacteria. To evaluate the integrity of the epithelial monolayers, we\n suggest monitoring the TEER values at various time points. We also suggest to only use intact\n monolayers that show an increase in TEER values over time. Alternatively, the epithelial barrier\n integrity can also be evaluated using other assays, such as the leakage of Lucifer yellow from the apical\n to the basolateral side. The proliferative state of the monolayers can be evaluated using commercially\n available proliferative kits, such as the incorporation of nucleotide analogs during DNA synthesis\n (EdU staining) described in Box 1.\n\n\n Coculture\n As an example, we describe how to coculture epithelial monolayers with engineered B. thetaiotao-\n micron bacteria. The bacterium B. thetaiotaomicron was engineered with genetic circuits that can turn\n on different programs in response to different external environments, where the output of the circuit\n is reported via expression and activity of luciferase. A logic circuit that could report the presence of\n either secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA) or anhydrotetracycline (aTc), or the absence\n of either, was engineered into B. thetaiotaomicron10. The circuit was tested using luciferase as the\n sole reporter; hence, three strains were required to measure the individual outputs as described\n previously10. An additional strain of B. thetaiotaomicron (MT768) was constructed to constantly\n express luciferase and was used as a control for standardization of the luciferase activity. The multi-\n input, multi-output, logic system was built using a combination of three NOR gates built with\n\n3878 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | AUGUST 2021 | 3874–3900 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n CRISPRi-dCas9, integrated into DCA and aTc sensors as inputs and three different output promoters.\n This resulted in three bacterial strains (MT798, MT799 and MT800) that have the same circuit but\n report only one of the three output promoters10. For the experimental setup, four separate bacterial\n cocultures (M768, M798, M799 and MT800) were started once the monolayers showed signs of\n differentiation (an increase in TEER values over time, which generally takes 7 d). After 2 h of\n bacterial–epithelial coculture, the bacterial genetic circuits were induced by the addition of inducers.\n Each strain was exposed to the four combinations of inducers (i.e., 62.5 µM DCA, 100 ng μl−1 aTc,\n DCA+aTc, and none (as a control)).\n\n Evaluation of coculture\n Eight hours after the start of coculture (i.e., 6 h after introduction of the inducers), we evaluated\n the effects of the different culture conditions on bacterial growth, gene circuit activation and\n epithelial monolayer integrity. The bacteria cell density was measured using optical density at\n 600 nm. The gene circuit activation by the inducers was determined by measuring the luciferase\n activity in each strain and condition using the NanoLuc luciferase assay. The resulting bacteria\n cell density and the luminescence in the test (MT798, MT799 and MT800) and control bacterial\n strains (MT768) were used to calculate the output of the gene circuit, which was designated as relative\n promoter units (RPULs). In our experimental setting, the RPUL for each strain was greatest when\n exposed to the inducer corresponding to its designed genetic circuit compared with other inducers;\n e.g., strain MT798 exhibited greater output in response to DCA compared with aTC along, aTC plus\n DCA, or no inducer. In addition, the integrity of the epithelial monolayer was monitored via TEER\n measurement and then characterized by immunoﬂuorescent staining to identify the location of\n bacteria in the epithelium–bacteria coculture system (Fig. 1). We did not undertake additional\n characterization of the epithelial monolayer permeability using molecular tracers; however, this\n can be employed30. More detailed phenotypic insights can also be obtained by analyzing the\n mucin production and harvesting the epithelial monolayer to conduct expression analysis via\n RNAseq or qPCR26.\n\n\n Limitations\n A current limitation of the Transwell system is that it does not provide dynamic control of nutrient\n renewal, which can result in bacterial overgrowth within 10–12 h of culture. A short (<8 h) timescale\n is sufﬁcient for testing the responses of engineered bacteria to speciﬁc inducers, but may limit other\n applications requiring longer periods of culture. This limitation can be overcome by integrating the\n Transwell monolayer into a microphysiological system that controls apical ﬂow to provide con-\n tinuous nutrient replenishment for the bacterial compartment26. Another limitation of the Transwell\n monolayer is that the apical compartment is not anaerobic and thus can only be used for culturing\n aerotolerant bacteria such as B. thetaiotaomicron, B. fragilis, Biﬁdobacteria and Lactobacillus. This\n challenge has been overcome by incorporating Transwell monolayers into a specialized micro-\n physiological systems26. For the very short term (a few hours), a system without apical ﬂow allows\n acute responses to be assessed18,20,43,55. For the longer term (hours to days) a device called gut-\n microbe (GuMI) with anaerobic apical ﬂow and aerobic basal ﬂow maintains an oxygen gradient\n across the epithelial barrier similar to a healthy colon in vivo, enabling successful days-long coculture\n of colon epithelial cells with oxygen-sensitive bacteria, such as F. prausnitzii and Eubacterium rec-\n tale26. Collectively, the studies described above exemplify the potentially wide application of the\n epithelial monolayer method described in this protocol.\n Donor-to-donor variability can also affect the success of establishing functional epithelial\n monolayers. Although we did not exhaustively test many donors for monolayer formation, we\n observed a variability in the successful rate of monolayer generation from three different donors\n tested (Fig. 2 and Source Data Fig. 2). For example, the successful rate for generating usable\n monolayers from one donor was only 33% compared with another donor in which all monolayers\n were usable (100%). The variability we have seen is not due to reagents or organoid culture condi-\n tions, since donors that have lower monolayer formation efﬁciency could be maintained as organoids\n in Matrigel. We speculate that intrinsic donor properties as well as the removal of Matrigel that\n supply unknown factors during organoid culture can account for the variability in monolayer for-\n mation. Therefore, we recommend that users perform pilot experiments with organoids from mul-\n tiple donors to test monolayer formation efﬁciency and monolayer stability prior to establishing\n coculture experiments. In our experience, monolayers from donors with low monolayer formation\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | AUGUST 2021 | 3874–3900 | www.nature.com/nprot 3879\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n a\n 120\n n = 36 n = 21 n = 12 n=3\n 100\n\n\n Successful proportion\n 80% 100%\n 80\n 66%\n 60\n\n 40 33%\n\n 20\n\n 0\n Total Donor 1 Donor 2 Donor 3\n\n b\n 15\n Account for 88.2%\n of total culture times\n\n\n Frequency of values\n 10\n\n\n 5\n\n\n 0\n <80 80–85 85–90 90–95 95–100\n Cell viability (%)\n\n Fig. 2 | The success rate of generating usable monolayers and the cell viability of single cells from dissociated\n organoids used for monolayer seeding. a, The success rate in generating usable monolayers varied among\n three donors. n represents the number of attempts (weeks) to generate monolayer of indicated donors in the\n year 2019. Two donors were excluded, one because it was only used once, the other because a culture was\n contaminated. b, The viability of single cells obtained after processing organoids. In most cases, the cell viability\n reached >80%.\n\n\n efﬁciency also showed areas in the Transwells that are not covered by epithelial cells. Usually, these\n areas are located at the edge of the monolayers and can be easily identiﬁed using an inverted\n microscope and light microscopy (see details in the Troubleshooting section).\n\nMaterials\n\n Biological materials\n ● Colon organoids. Colon organoids used in this study were established by the Yilmaz lab at the Koch\n Institute/Massachusetts Institute of Technology and by the Breault lab at Boston Children’s Hospital.\n Details of individual organoids are given in Table 1. They were derived following the procedure\n available at http://breaultlab.org/progﬁles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/web_human-tissue-processing.\n pdf. To establish organoid cultures, endoscopic tissue biopsies were collected from the ascending colon\n of deidentiﬁed individuals at either Massachusetts General Hospital or Boston Children’s Hospital\n upon the donors’ informed consent. Methods were carried out in accordance with the Institutional\n Review Board of Boston Children’s Hospital (protocol number IRB-P00000529) and the Koch Institute\n Institutional Review Board Committee as well as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Committee\n on the use of humans as experimental subjects. Once organoids are established, they can be used for\n monolayer formation after two passages from thawing ! CAUTION The use of human tissues must\n follow all relevant ethical guidelines, and informed consent should be obtained from the tissue donors\n and the protocol approved by the research institution. Authenticity of the cells should be regularly\n checked (we undertake a morphology check by microscope), and cultures should be regularly tested for\n mycoplasma contamination. All work on primary cells should be performed in Biosafety Level 2\n laboratories or higher with proper precautions and personal protection equipment. All cell-containing\n samples need to be decontaminated upon disposal as biohazard materials.\n ● Bacteria of interest. We obtained glycerol stocks of B. thetaiotaomicron engineered to contain speciﬁc\n\n\n genetic circuits (MT768, MT798, MT799 and MT800) from the Voigt lab at the Massachusetts\n Institute of Technology. Full details of these bacteria are in ref. 10.\n\n3880 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | AUGUST 2021 | 3874–3900 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n Reagents\n ● Advanced DMEM/F12, 500 ml (Gibco, cat. no. 12634-010)\n ● DMEM/F12 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Spray thoroughly with 70%\n ethanol, and place gently into the glass dish containing ice.\n CRITICAL Ice is not sterile; use with extra caution in the biosafety cabinet.\n c\n\n\n 10 After centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant (washing medium) with vacuum using a sterile\n Pasteur pipette.\n 11 Resuspend the organoid pellet with 1.2 ml of Matrigel and seed 50 µl droplets into each well of an\n Olympus 24-well, tissue culture treated plate.\n CRITICAL It is important to use Olympus 24-well tissue culture treated plates as they keep the\n c\n\n\n Matrigel droplets spherical, which is critical for 3D organoid growth.\n 12 Carefully transfer the plate(s) containing Matrigel droplets to the CO2 incubator. Incubate for\n 15–20 min to allow Matrigel gelation. After 15–20 min, check the Matrigel gelation by tilting the\n plates. If the Matrigel holds ﬁrm, they should be ready.\n 13 Place the plate(s) inside the biosafety cabinet and add 600 µl of colon organoid medium to each\n well. Carefully dispense the medium into the side of the well to avoid disturbing the Matrigel\n droplet. At this point, organoids will be small. In some cases, it is possible to see fragmented\n organoids with an inverted bright-ﬁeld microscope.\n 14 After 3 d of culture, observe under an inverted microscope to ensure organoids have increased in\n size (>100 μm in diameter), and proceed with the organoid passaging protocol (e.g., if thawed on\n Friday, passage on Monday).\n\n Colon organoid passaging ● Timing 7 d cycle (organoid growth); 4–5 h (organoid\n passaging)\n CRITICAL Organoids should be passaged at a 7 d cycle (e.g., passage organoids every Monday).

Alternatively, this medium can be prepared during CRS\n incubation (Step 24).\n 20 Collect organoid droplets using the medium in which they are currently growing. Using a 1,000 µl\n pipette, set the pipette to 650 µl (there should be a maximum volume in each well of 50 µl Matrigel\n and 600 µl medium). Scrape the bottom of the well with the pipette tip to dislodge the Matrigel\n droplet before drawing up the medium. Place medium and organoids into a 15 ml conical tube. One\n 24-well plate of organoids should ﬁt into one 15 ml conical tube.\n CRITICAL Allow space beneath the pipette tip when drawing up the Matrigel suspension (do not\n c\n press against bottom of the well). If an obvious amount of Matrigel droplet remains, adhered to the\n plate after drawing up the medium, return the medium to the well and repeat scraping to dislodge\n the remaining Matrigel. Small fragments of the Matrigel droplet will likely remain stuck to the plate\n even after repeating the procedure. As long as ≥90% of the droplet is collected, that is acceptable, as\n negligible number of organoids will be left behind in these small fragments.\n 21 Centrifuge the collected Matrigel droplets at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, there\n should be ~1 ml Matrigel pellet per 24-well plate of organoid droplets collected.\n 22 Aspirate the supernatant (spent organoid growth medium) with vacuum using a sterile Pasteur\n pipette.\n 23 Resuspend the Matrigel pellet in CRS using a 1:10 dilution. For a full 24-well plate of organoids, use\n 12 ml of CRS. Resuspend the Matrigel droplet by gently inverting the 15 ml conical tube.\n CRITICAL Do not resuspend the droplet by repeated pipetting as organoid will adhere to the\n c\n\n\n serological pipette and there might be some organoid loss.\n 24 Incubate the resuspended Matrigel in the ice bucket for 45–60 min, or until Matrigel is dissolved.\n Mix the Matrigel–CRS solution via gentle inversion every 10–15 min. Organoids will settle at the\n bottom of the tube when Matrigel is fully dissolved.\n CRITICAL Do not exceed 60 min of incubation as this can decrease cell viability. Do not vortex\n c\n\n\n the organoid suspension.\n 25 Centrifuge at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, there should be a noticeable organoid\n pellet, ~200 µl volume of organoid, depending on the density of the original culture. During\n centrifugation, prepare the material for the subsequent steps: sterilize a glass dish with PREempt\n disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol. Add ice to 50–70% capacity of the glass dish, spray with 70%\n ethanol again and place the dish into the biosafety cabinet. Put Matrigel aliquots into the aluminum\n cooling block. Spray thoroughly with 70% ethanol, and place it into the glass dish containing\n the ice.\n CRITICAL Ice is not sterile; use with extra caution in the biosafety cabinet.\n c\n\n\n 26 Aspirate CRS using vacuum and a sterile Pasteur pipette. After aspiration, place the conical tube\n into the glass dish containing ice.\n CRITICAL Remove the CRS as much as possible, as remaining CRS could decrease the cell\n c\n\n\n viability and compromise the integrity of the Matrigel matrix.\n 27 Calculate the volume needed for the desired splitting ratio allowing 50 μl of Matrigel per well\n (i.e., 1.2 ml Matrigel per 24-well plate). A typical splitting ratio is 1:3 to 1:5, but this varies and\n depends on the density of the original culture, length of culture since original thaw, and donor\n intrinsic growth behavior.\n 28 Keep the tube on ice, and resuspend the organoid pellet in a maximum of 1 ml of Matrigel. If the\n total volume required is <1 ml, add the required volume; for example, if 900 µl is needed to achieve\n the desired splitting ratio, add 900 µl.\n CRITICAL Initially, 1 ml is added since a larger volume makes it harder to dissociate the\n c\n\n\n organoids and leads to a more diverse organoid fragment size.\n 29 Bend a 1,000 µl pipette tip by pressing down the pipette tip on the inside of the cap for the conical\n tube. Use this bent tip to pipette the Matrigel suspension 25 times if organoids are in the ﬁrst\n passage after thawing. Otherwise pipette the Matrigel suspension 50 times. After resuspension,\n check the level of organoid fragmentation under an inverted microscope. If further dissociation is\n needed, return conical tube to ice in the biosafety cabinet, continue pipetting with bent pipette tip\n 25 more times and reexamine under the microscope. Repeat until mostly fragments remain.\n CRITICAL Organoids are more fragile after the ﬁrst thawing and will be dissociated into\n c\n\n\n fragments much more easily. Do not observe organoid fragmentation under the microscope for\n >10 s to avoid Matrigel polymerization. If >10 s is needed to evaluate the level of organoid\n\n3886 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | AUGUST 2021 | 3874–3900 | www.nature.com/nprot\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL\n fragmentation, look at 10 s intervals, returning the tube to the ice bucket between intervals.\n An alternative approach is to take a 5–10 μl aliquot of the organoid–Matrigel mixture using a wide\n oriﬁce pipette tip, place the droplet on a microscope slide and assess organoid fragmentation.\n A Matrigel suspension with mostly organoid fragments is desired.\n 30 Once organoids have been fragmented, add the remaining Matrigel needed (calculated in Step 27)\n to achieve the desired passaging ratio. Mix the Matrigel–organoid fragment suspension well before\n proceeding to the next step.\n 31 Seed 50 µl droplets of the fragment suspension into each well of an Olympus 24-well, tissue culture\n treated plate.\n CRITICAL It is important to use Olympus 24-well, tissue culture treated plates as they maintain\n cspherical Matrigel droplets, which are critical for 3D organoid growth. Using Falcon tissue culture\n treated plates results in the spreading and ﬂattening of the Matrigel droplet. Alternatively, Falcon\n non-tissue culture treated plates may be used, but as these do not allow adhesion of the droplets,\n there is a high risk of the Matrigel droplets dislodging from the well and being aspirated when\n changing media.\n 32 Carefully transfer the plate(s) containing Matrigel droplets to the CO2 incubator. Incubate the\n plates for 15–20 min to allow Matrigel gelation. After 15–20 min, check the Matrigel gelation by\n tilting the plates. If the Matrigel holds ﬁrm, they should be ready.\n 33 Place the plate(s) in the biosafety cabinet. Add 600 µl of colon organoid medium to each well by\n carefully loading into the side of the well to avoid disturbing the Matrigel droplet.\n 34 Incubate tissue culture plates in cell culture incubator at 37 °C, 95% air and 5% CO2 for 4 d (i.e., if\n passaged on Monday, move to next step to change medium on Friday).\n\n Colon organoid medium change ● Timing 0.5–1.5 h\n 35 Sterilize biosafety cabinet with PREempt disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol.\n 36 Prepare organoid growth medium (15 ml for every plate) according to Table 3. Medium should be\n prepared fresh each time, as the small molecules and proteins can become unstable if they remain in\n the medium for a long time.\n 37 Carefully aspirate the medium from each of the wells using a vacuum aspirator and a sterile Pasteur\n pipette. When aspirating, tilt the plate toward yourself and press the pipette tip against the bottom\n of the well to avoid disrupting the Matrigel droplet adhered in the center of the well.\n 38 Add 600 µl of medium per well by carefully loading into the side of the well to avoid disturbing the\n Matrigel droplet.\n 39 Place plate back into incubator. Generally, organoids are ready for both passaging and monolayer\n seeding 3 d later (7 d after seeding).\n\n Colon monolayer seeding (single cells) ● Timing 4–6 h; 2.5 h (Transwell coating); 2–4 h\n (monolayer seeding)\n Transwell coating\n 40 Obtain a bucket of ice, and keep the collagen I on ice\n 41 Sterilize biosafety cabinet using PREempt disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol.\n 42 Prepare a coating solution containing 50 µg/ml collagen I in PBS−/−. For 12-well Transwells, add\n 300 µl of coating solution on the apical side and 1,200 µl on the basolateral side.\n 43 Incubate the Transwells at 37 °C for at least 2 h to allow collagen coating to occur.\n\n Organoid collection, single cell dissociation and monolayer seeding\n 44 Prepare colon monolayer seeding medium as described in Table 4. At least 2 ml should be made for\n each Transwell plus an additional 1–2 ml for cell counting. Alternatively, medium can be prepared\n during CRS incubation (Step 46).\n 45 Collect organoids as described in Steps 20–23.\n 46 After resuspending in CRS, incubate on ice for 45–60 min, or until Matrigel is dissolved. Resuspend\n the Matrigel via gentle inversion every 10–15 min, and proceed to the next step 15 min before the\n end of incubation.\n CRITICAL Do not exceed 60 min incubation time in CRS as this can decrease cell viability. The\n c\n\n\n trypsin/EDTA used in following steps will degrade most of any remaining matrix.\n 47 With 15 min remaining for the CRS incubation, place a 1× Trypsin/EDTA aliquot into a 37 °C\n water bath.\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | AUGUST 2021 | 3874–3900 | www.nature.com/nprot 3887\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n 48 Centrifuge organoids from Step 46 at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, there should be\n a noticeable organoid pellet, ~50–200 µl in size depending on the density of the original culture.\n 49 During centrifugation, place prewarmed trypsin/EDTA and washing medium inside the biosafety\n cabinet. Make aliquots of 15 mL of washing medium. One 15 mL aliquot is needed per plate of\n organoid culture.\n 50 After centrifugation, place the 15 ml conical tube containing the organoids inside the biosafety\n cabinet, and aspirate the CRS using vacuum and a sterile Pasteur pipette.\n CRITICAL While aspirating the CRS, slowly tip the 15 mL tube and avoid placing the Pasteur\n\n\n c\n pipette too close to the organoid pellet.\n 51 Resuspend the organoid pellet in 1 ml prewarmed trypsin/EDTA via short and quick repeat\n pipetting. Incubate the organoid pellet in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min.\n CRITICAL Avoid completely drawing up the organoid suspension/pellet when adding trypsin/\n c\n\n EDTA. Organoids are very ‘sticky’ after CRS incubation, so drawing the whole suspension into the\n pipette tip will result in organoid loss.\n 52 After incubation in trypsin/EDTA, take the 15 mL conical tube inside a biosafety cabinet to initiate\n single cell preparation. To break up the organoids, ﬁrst prewet a 1,000 μl pipette tip in washing\n medium, then bend the pipette tip by pressing the tip on the inside of the 15 ml conical tube cap.\n Finally, to dissociate the organoids and generate single cells, pipette the organoids 50 times and\n then inspect under the microscope for single cells. If a substantial number of organoids and/or\n fragments remains, pipette with a bent tip for an additional 50 times before evaluating again. Repeat\n cycles of pipetting 50 times until the suspension is primarily single cells.\n CRITICAL Pipette tip needs to be wet before bending. This will decrease the organoid adherence\n c\n\n\n to the pipette tip. Do not exceed 10 min total in trypsin/EDTA, because this will decrease cell\n viability. Even if the cells have not reached primarily single cells after 10 min of mechanical\n dissociation, proceed to next step. It is important to maintain the cell viability. Foaming might be\n present during single cell preparation, but it should not affect cell viability.\n With a new (nonbent) pipette tip, add washing medium to the cell suspension to neutralize the\n trypsin/EDTA. If cell dissociation resulted in a single-cell suspension in the previous step, use a\n serological pipette to add a sufﬁcient volume of washing medium to the cell suspension to reach\n 15 ml. If cell dissociation did not reach single-cell suspension, add 1 ml of washing medium to the\n cell suspension, and continue pipetting with a bent pipette tip until a single-cell suspension is\n reached. Then, use a serological pipette to add a sufﬁcient volume of washing medium to the cell\n suspension to reach 15 ml.\n CRITICAL Do not mix with a serological pipette, as this results in cell loss.\n c\n\n\n 53 Centrifuge single-cell suspension at 400g for 5 min at 4 °C.\n CRITICAL Make sure the centrifuge is at no higher than 800g to preserve high cell viability.\n c\n\n\n 54 Aspirate and discard the supernatant using vacuum and a sterile Pasteur pipette.\n CRITICAL Leave ~50 µl of liquid at the bottom of the tube to avoid cell loss that occurs from\n c\n\n\n placing the Pasteur pipette too close to the cell pellet during aspiration.\n 55 Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of colon monolayer seeding medium. Take a 15 µl aliquot of the\n cell suspension to determine cell density.\n CRITICAL Ensure the suspension is well mixed before taking the aliquot. Take 15 µl from the\n c\n\n\n middle of the cell suspension to make it as representative as possible of the entire suspension.\n 56 Add 15 µl of Trypan Blue to the 15 µl aliquot cell suspension, and mix well via repeated pipetting.\n Count cells and assess viability by adding 10 µl of the suspension to each side of a disposable\n Countess chamber slide and inserting into Countess machine. Determine cell density from both\n sides of the slide, and record live cell density and % viability.\n ! CAUTION If there is a large discrepancy between the two cell counts, repeat cell counting with a\n new aliquot. An alternative protocol for cell counting is to use a hemocytometer following the\n manufacturer’s protocol for cell density determination.\n ?

For 12-well Transwells, add 0.5 ml of the cell suspension into the apical side.\n 61 Add colon monolayer seeding medium to the basolateral side of each Transwell. For 12-well\n Transwells, add 1.5 ml of medium per Transwell.\n 62 Place the seeded Transwells in a 37 °C incubator at 5% CO2. Inspect the Transwells every day under\n an inverted bright-ﬁeld microscope for conﬂuency.\n CRITICAL Colon cells are ﬂat and hard to see when attached to the Transwell membrane. As\n c\n\n time progresses, the tight junctions will be more visible under phase contrast. Proceed to next step\n to measure TEER for the ﬁrst time on day 3 after seeding. Typically, the ﬁrst medium change (to\n start differentiation) also occurs on day 3 after seeding (i.e., if seeded on Mondays, medium change\n and ﬁrst TEER measurement take place on Thursdays).\n\n\n Monolayer differentiation and TEER monitoring ● Timing 1–2 h\n CRITICAL This section describes how to monitor TEER using EndOhm cup chambers and epithelial\n c\n\n\n volt/ohm meter; while we have not tested alternative systems, it is likely they could be substituted,\n and the steps described here can be adapted for use with other systems. Independent of the instrument\n used to monitor TEER, ﬁrst sterilize the biosafety cabinet with PREempt disinfectant solution and\n 70% ethanol.\n 63 Make aliquots of base medium and PBS−/−. Typically, 45 ml of base medium and 40 ml of PBS−/−\n should be sufﬁcient for one 12-well plate of monolayers. Prewarm the aliquots in a 37 °C water bath\n for ~10 min.\n 64 To disinfect the tweezers needed for Transwell manipulation during TEER measurement, prepare\n two 45 ml aliquots of 70% ethanol in 50 ml conical tubes.\n 65 Place a pair of long tweezers in one of the 70% ethanol aliquots for sterilization.\n 66 Prepare colon monolayer differentiation medium according to ‘Reagent setup’ and Table 5.\n CRITICAL Media should be freshly prepared whenever possible.\n c\n\n\n 67 If the cover to the EndOhm cup chamber is held shut with tape or paraﬁlm, remove the cover.\n Spray the outer surface of the chamber and connecting wires thoroughly with 70% ethanol. Avoid\n getting excessive amounts of ethanol on the ends of the wire, as this can cause inaccurate\n measurements at later steps. Open the chamber, and spray 70% ethanol on both the bottom and\n inside of the cap.\n 68 Bring the EndOhm chamber into the biosafety cabinet, leaving the end of the wire that connects to\n the Ohmmeter outside the cabinet.\n 69 Place the Ohmmeter next to the biosafety cabinet (on a small, portable table), and connect the wire\n to the Ohmmeter. Keep the Ohmmeter turned off.\n 70 Rinse the EndOhm chamber with 6 ml of 70% ethanol, and then ﬁll with 6 ml of fresh 70% ethanol\n and let it sit for at least 5 min.\n ! CAUTION Do not exceed 30 min in 70% ethanol. This could damage the wire contacts in the\n EndOhm chamber and lead to inaccurate measurements. For 12-well Transwells, 6 ml is sufﬁcient\n to ﬁll the chamber.\n 71 Aspirate the 70% ethanol completely from the EndOhm chamber. Wash and rinse the chamber\n completely at least three times as follows: after removing the 70% ethanol, wash the EndOhm\n chamber once with 6 ml of prewarmed PBS−/−, then ﬁll the chamber with 6 ml of pre-warm\n PBS−/−. Let it sit for 2 min. Aspirate the PBS−/−, then wash again with 6 ml of PBS−/−. After this\n wash, add 3 ml of PBS−/− to the EndOhm chamber, place the top cover on top of the chamber and\n set aside.\n 72 Turn on the Ohmmeter and record the background measurement when in PBS−/−. The\n background measurement will vary because of a wide range of factors, and readings from −5 Ω to\n +5 Ω are acceptable for the 12-well chamber.\n CRITICAL If the background measurement is abnormal, leave the system to sit and equilibrate in\n c\n\n\n PBS−/− for longer.\n\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | AUGUST 2021 | 3874–3900 | www.nature.com/nprot 3889\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n 73 After recording the ohms background, aspirate the PBS−/− from the chamber.

On the ﬁnal rinse, add 2.5 ml of base medium needed in the chamber for TEER\n measurements.\n 74 Remove tweezers/forceps from 70% ethanol. Allow the alcohol to evaporate from the forceps inside\n the biosafety cabinet, making sure the tweezers/forceps tips are away from any surface.\n 75 Using a vacuum aspirator and Pasteur pipette, aspirate the medium from both apical and the\n basolateral side of the Transwells. Tilt the plate toward yourself, and aspirate with the pipette tip\n pressed against the bottom of the well in the basolateral side. Completely aspirate the basolateral\n side of every Transwell ﬁrst, then go back and aspirate the apical side of each Transwell. This order\n of aspiration is recommended by the Transwell manufacturers.\n CRITICAL Be very careful when aspirating the apical side of the Transwell. Do not completely\n c\n\n\n aspirate the apical side (leave ~50 µl), to avoid damaging the monolayer.\n CRITICAL If you wish to determine the proliferative state of the monolayer using EdU staining,\n c\n\n\n follow the instructions given in Box 1.\n 76 Add base medium to the apical side of each Transwell. For 12-well Transwells, add 500 µl to the\n apical side.\n CRITICAL Dead/detached cells are expected to be ﬂoating on top of the monolayer at the ﬁrst\n c\n\n\n medium change (i.e., 3 d after seeding); hence, it is critical rinse the apical side with 500 µl of base\n medium once before adding fresh 500 µl of base medium. This extra rinse step will help remove\n dead cells and allow more stable TEER measurements.\n 77 Add base medium to the basolateral side of the Transwells. For 12-well Transwells, add 1.5 ml to\n the basolateral side.\n 78 Using the alcohol-sterilized and dried forceps, carefully pick up a Transwell and place it into the\n EndOhm chamber.
