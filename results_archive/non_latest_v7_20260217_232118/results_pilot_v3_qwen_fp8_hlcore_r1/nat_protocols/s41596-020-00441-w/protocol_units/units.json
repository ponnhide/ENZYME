Thompson1,2 and Takanori Takebe 1,2,3,4,5,6 ✉\n Human organoids are emerging as a valuable resource to investigate human organ development and disease. The\n applicability of human organoids has been limited, partly due to the oversimpliﬁed architecture of the current technology,\n which generates single-tissue organoids that lack inter-organ structural connections. Thus, engineering organoid systems\n that incorporate connectivity between neighboring organs is a critical unmet challenge in an evolving organoid ﬁeld. Here,\n we describe a protocol for the continuous patterning of hepatic, biliary and pancreatic (HBP) structures from a 3D culture\n of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). After differentiating PSCs into anterior and posterior gut spheroids, the two\n spheroids are fused together in one well. Subsequently, self-patterning of multi-organ (i.e., HBP) domains occurs within\n the boundary region of the two spheroids, even in the absence of any extrinsic factors. Long-term culture of HBP\n structures induces differentiation of the domains into segregated organs complete with developmentally relevant\n1234567890():,;\n\n\n invagination and epithelial branching. This in-a-dish model of human hepato-biliary-pancreatic organogenesis provides a\n1234567890():,;\n\n\n unique platform for studying human development, congenital disorders, drug development and therapeutic transplanta-\n tion. More broadly, our approach could potentially be used to establish inter-organ connectivity models for other organ\n systems derived from stem cell cultures.\n\n\n Introduction\n Failure to establish contiguous organ architectures because of developmental defects, infection or\n drug toxicity leads to critical and, in most cases, lethal organ failures, as seen in biliary atresia,\n tracheoesophageal ﬁstula and congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract. Animal models\n have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms for generating connections between tissues.\n However, because of profound differences in both metabolism and molecular regulation between\n animals and humans, translation of these ﬁndings from animal models into human biology and\n disease remains a major challenge1.\n Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids are increasingly recognized as cutting-\n edge in vitro model systems for investigating human organ development and diseases, with the\n potential to also supplant fetal tissue research2–8. However, the applicability of hPSC-derived orga-\n noids has been limited thus far, partly because technology has been limited to the generation of\n single-tissue organoids lacking inter-organ structural connections. It is vital to understand the\n mechanisms that drive the intricate inter-organ orchestrations that occur during organogenesis,\n which can then be leveraged for developing appropriate multi-organ 3-D stem cell culture systems\n that allow for seamless connections to neighboring tissues9–11.\n Here, we describe a 3D differentiation approach using hPSCs to grow gut spheroids with distinct\n regional identities, which are comprised of both endoderm and mesoderm populations. We\n demonstrate that the anterior and posterior spheroid interactions recapitulate the in vivo foregut and\n midgut boundary. These interactions generate an organoid composed of several types of organs,\n called a human hepato-biliary-pancreatic (HBP) organoid (HBPO)12, that can model the inter-\n coordinated speciﬁcation and invagination that naturally occur in development.

This endodermal sheet begins to fold in at the\n anterior and posterior ends, forming the anterior and caudal intestinal portals, respectively, during\n early somitogenesis13. During anterior intestinal portal formation and subsequent foregut tubulo-\n genesis, a medial part of the foregut endoderm sheet is roughly deﬁned in the dorsal walls of the\n primitive gut tubes, and the lateral foregut endoderm cells are relocated into the ventral midline of the\n gut tube closure14. During foregut closure, the liver, gallbladder, and ventral pancreas primordia are\n speciﬁed within adjacent regions of the ventral foregut endoderm.\n The formation of each individual primordium is induced and maintained by distinct signaling\n factors released from neighboring tissues15,16. In the posterior foregut, mesodermal cues instigate\n localized proliferation and/or migration of the endoderm, which results in budding of the liver, and\n dorsal and ventral pancreas by embryonic day 9.5. After embryonic day 9.5, the speciﬁed endodermal\n organ domains of the gut tube undergo morphogenesis and lineage diversiﬁcation to create the\n functional architecture connecting neighboring organs.\n Well-deﬁned temporal expression of certain genes has been localized to distinct regions during\n organogenesis, and this gene expression can be exploited to identify particular areas of the embryo. In\n vivo, the HBP anlage, which is demarcated by HHEX (hematopoietically-expressed homeobox pro-\n tein) and PDX1 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1) expression17, is ﬁrst speciﬁed at the boundary\n region between the foregut and midgut, as indicated by expression of the foregut endoderm marker\n SOX2 (SRY-box2) and the mid/hindgut endoderm marker CDX2 (caudal-type homeobox2),\n respectively. The HBP anlage forms an epithelial vesicle invaginating ventrally from the primitive gut\n as a result of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions18,19. Given that genetic perturbation of such\n boundary-deﬁning genes disrupts integral multi-organ development20, it is clear that continuous,\n dynamic organogenesis occurs in a complex environment and is probably driven by neighboring\n factors (such as boundary interactions)21. From this knowledge, we hypothesized that the recapitu-\n lation of the foregut-midgut boundary in a stem cell culture acts to induce continuous hepatic, biliary\n and pancreatic structures.\n Therefore, to develop a foregut-midgut boundary, we ﬁrst exposed deﬁnitive endoderm, patterned\n as previously described4, to ﬁbroblast growth factor and a WNT signaling agonist, which promote gut\n tube formation and patterning, in the presence or absence of a bone morphogenetic protein\n antagonist, which induces foregut speciﬁcation, to direct SOX2 expressing anterior or CDX2\n expressing posterior gut fate.\n\n Overview of the procedure\n The overall procedure can be separated into six major stages (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Video 1).\n Stage 1 is PSC culture (Steps 1–19; day −2 to day −1). Stage 2 is deﬁnitive endoderm induction (Steps\n 20–29; day 0–day 2). Stage 3 is anterior/posterior gut patterning (Steps 30–33; day 3–day 6) and\n anterior/posterior gut spheroid formation (Steps 34–37; day 7). Stage 4 is anterior-posterior boundary\n formation (Steps 38–41; day 8). Stage 5 is HBPO polarization culture (Steps 42–48; day 9–day 12).\n Stage 6 is long-term HBPO growth culture (Steps 49–55; day 13 onward).\n\n Applications\n Studying mechanisms by which inter-tissue connections are generated in humans remains a major\n challenge because of limited access to fetal samples and poor manipulability22. Although signaling\n mechanisms for organ speciﬁcation have been studied in animal models, the ways in which com-\n binatorial endoderm-mesoderm interactions orchestrate inter-connected and multi-organ patterning\n in humans remain elusive. Human HBPOs can serve as an in-a-dish model to investigate and\n interrogate the complex inter-organ segregation process. For example, we have shown that the\n transient and localized suppression of retinoic acid signaling at the foregut-midgut border is crucial\n for directing HBP patterning in hPSC-derived organoids12. Interestingly, in agreement with animal\n studies, the accompanying mesenchyme probably plays an important role in lineage speciﬁcation into\n HBP precursors. Therefore, this system provides a novel platform that will facilitate future\n mechanistic studies about contributions of different cell types in organogenesis.

Biliary atresia, a disease of inter-organ con-\n nectivity failure, is the most common indication for pediatric liver transplantation worldwide.\n Persistent inﬂammation and obstruction in the bile ducts lead to abnormal accumulation of bile and\n consequently signiﬁcant liver damage. Several animal model studies of experimental biliary atresia\n have investigated the role of a Notch effector, Hes family bHLH transcription factor 1 (HES1), in the\n initiation and progression of the disease. Deﬁcient Hes1 expression results in induction of experi-\n mental biliary atresia in animals23, with ectopic pancreatic endocrine cell generation probably due to\n the role of HES1 as a general negative regulator of endodermal endocrine differentiation23. We know\n that HES1 expression is evolutionariy conserved in gallbladder primordium and its derivatives in\n humans, but it remains unclear how HES1 activity is involved in the segregation of the HBP pri-\n mordium and subsequent development of the bile duct system. In HBPOs differentiated from PSCs\n with a genetic knock-out of HES1, biliary speciﬁcation is abolished, while pancreatic fate commitment\n is promoted in Hes1-deﬁcient mice12.\n Building inter-organ connections in a dish has been a long-standing challenge because of a limited\n understanding of the developmental processes during organogenesis. Previous studies have also been\n hindered by lack of efﬁcient programming of the cells to naturally segregate and organize in a\n spatiotemporally appropriate manner. Many attempts have been made to either developmentally or\n synthetically solve these issues, including organoid generation, tissue printing, cell-material composite\n formation and decellularization and recellularization of existing 3D tissue. Each of these methods has\n shown some success; however, none has provided a durable, persistently functional system1.\n\nNATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | FEBRUARY 2021 | 919–936 | www.nature.com/nprot 921\n\nPROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS\n\n Recapitulating boundary interactions in 3D stem cell culture is one potential approach to drive an\n organ segregation program10,24–27. Animal organogenesis studies have revealed that the prospective\n HBP region arises from a boundary between the foregut and midgut. Co-cultivation of stem\n cell–derived foregut and midgut is sufﬁcient to induce a boundary-speciﬁc transcriptional program\n that includes the modulation of WNT and retinoic acid pathways, leading to HBPO generation. Thus,\n in vitro boundary modeling could potentially be used to establish inter-organ connectivity models for\n other organ systems derived from stem cell cultures.\n\n Experimental design\n Differentiation is achieved through several steps, starting with the 2D generation of anterior and\n posterior gut cells according to previously described methods4,28 with certain key modiﬁcations in\n basal medium and concentration of growth factors. Next, from these 2D cultures, we make single-cell\n suspensions of the anterior and posterior gut cells, and, in the presence of the Rho kinase inhibitor\n Y-27632, spheroids are generated on day 7. The successful generation of stable spheroids is absolutely\n critical to efﬁciently and consistently form HBPOs. Therefore, the size of the aggregates is crucial, and\n careful consideration must be given to both the number of cells used and the incubation time for\n aggregate formation. To generate a boundary organoid, one anterior and one posterior spheroid are\n carefully mixed in Matrigel in a single well, wherein the two spheroids will fuse overnight (Fig. 1).\n For long-term culture, we tested several different culture conditions for the day 13 boundary\n organoids to evaluate HBP organogenesis12. Among the tested culture conditions, we found that\n using the air–liquid interface system of excised PROX1+ domains continued the morphogenesis for\n the longest period, resulting in the formation of a branching structure that we have called HBPO.\n Time-course imaging showed that the dissected PROX1+ domain changed from an epithelial\n morphology to a more convoluted structure after 2 d of culture.\n\n Alternative methods\n Recently, several groups have described hepato-biliary-like organoids that can be differentiated from\n hPSCs and fetal liver progenitor cells29,30. However, these methods generate liver tissues composed of\n intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes, and do not generate any extrahepatic components\n or surrounding organs. Tissue decellularization and recellularization methods have shown some\n success in creating more spatially deﬁned 3D tissues, but the temporal dynamics that naturally occur\n between organs during biological or pathological processes have not yet been modelled31,32. Our\n system is potentially compatible with emerging organ-on-chip technologies, provided a measurable\n readout can be developed33.\n\n Limitations\n The early stage of our protocol (up to day 13) can be carried out with high efﬁciency and repro-\n ducibility. However, moving into later stages, morphological variation is observed between experi-\n ments because of variation in the efﬁciency of branching of the pancreas-like tissue. Therefore, the\n dissection of the HBPO region by using a lineage-speciﬁc reporter PSC line is recommended to\n improve the efﬁciency of epithelial bifurcation.\n Our current HBPO system is less mature than adult tissues, and it is not suitable for transplan-\n tation applications. Further HBP organogenesis (e.g., to include the liver budding process, including\n delamination of the hepatic epithelial sheet by disruption of the laminar layer) would potentially\n require the addition of stromal cell components, such as septum transversum mesenchyme and/or\n endothelial progenitors. Nevertheless, the in vitro contiguous speciﬁcation and early morphogenesis\n of HBP subdomains provide an opportunity to investigate the complex interactions at the\n anterior–posterior boundary and the generation of interconnected, multi-organ structures. This\n model can be used to study personalized human organogenesis and model disease systems in vitro,\n with the ultimate goal of developing new therapies for human diseases.\n\nMaterials\n Biological materials\n ●\n Human PSCs.

Deﬁnitive endoderm differentiation (step 30;\n day 3; Fig. 2b–d)) yields a population of cells over 70% pure by SOX17 and FOXA2 double-positive\n staining (Fig. 2c)4,28,35. During the gut cell induction (Steps 31 and 32; days 3–7), 3D structures\n gradually form in a highly reproducible manner in various lines of PSCs (Fig. 2h). At day 7 (Step 33),\n we separately dissociate anterior gut cells and posterior gut cells to reaggregate them in low-\n attachment 96-well round-bottom plates. At day 8, SOX2 positive (~80%) anterior and CDX2 positive\n (~80%) posterior gut spheroids should form, and this can be conﬁrmed by whole-mount immu-\n nostaining as in Fig. 3b and FACS12. After mixing each gut spheroid in a low-attachment, 96-well\n round-bottom plate, fused spheroids form with a high rate of reproducibility12. At day 9, PDX1 or\n PROX1 expression is not observed; however, during polarization culture in Matrigel, both proteins\n began to be expressed at the boundary domain of the fused spheroids (Fig. 3d). We ﬁnd that\n morphogenesis continues in these PDX1 and PROX1 positive domains, which form a branching\n structure called an HBPO (Fig. 4a,b). The efﬁciency of HBPO production was increased approxi-\n mately two-fold by air–liquid interface culture in our validation study12. Time-course imaging shows\n that the PROX1 positive epithelium in the HBPO starts to invaginate and grow outward in multiple\n directions, progressively forming a branching structure around day 23 (Fig. 4c).
