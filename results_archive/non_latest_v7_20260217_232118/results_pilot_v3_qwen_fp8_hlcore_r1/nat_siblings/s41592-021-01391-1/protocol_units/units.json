(c) Particle positioning by valve oscillation. Approaching particles are detected in the\ndetection zone. Once a particle is detected, the channel valve is oscillated to induce discrete movements of particles. Oscillation is terminated once correct\nplacement of a particle is achieved. (d) Stopping accuracy in a defined window. Beads (n = 744) were positioned using valve oscillation, their position\nwas manually determined within the stopping area. Scale was approximated from channel width. (e) Volume-defined droplet on-demand generation by\nvalve pressurization. Droplets (n = 68, ~8 per condition, 1 experiment) were produced by pressurizing the dropleting valve at different pressures. Size was\ndetermined by imaging the dropleting process. Volumes were calculated from the imaging data based on droplet length and channel geometry. Thus, they\nshould be considered an approximation. Points represent mean values, error bars +/-SD. The channel width of displayed images is 250 μm.\n\n\n Nature Methods | www.nature.com/naturemethods\n\nNATuRE METHoDS Articles\n\n\nExtended Data Fig. 2 | Quality assessment of DisCo scRNA-seq data.
