require complicated cell isolation, seeding and bioprinting processes, while facing challenges
for accurately recapitulating PT physical characteristics such as lumen diameter and interaction
with supportive cell types.
 A potential way to overcome these limitations is to exploit the existing finely tuned
capacity of hPSCs to be directly differentiated into multicellular tissues that anatomically
resemble their in vivo counterparts. The generation of hPSC-derived kidney organoids is now
a well-established methodology, capable of developing segmented nephrons with evidence
of proximal, distal, stromal and endothelial elements1,2,8,9,46–48. However, standard kidney
organoids model the developing kidney, displaying PT immaturity at both a phenotypic
and functional level6,49,50. In this Protocol, we describe a unique methodology to generate
intact proximalized nephrons in an organoid format, together with cortical stroma, loop of
Henle and endothelial populations. Although less mature than fully differentiated adult PTs
in vivo, PT-enhanced organoids display superior PT maturation compared with standard
organoids derived from a range of protocols, with evidence of S1/S2/S3 PT cell types, improved
functionality and suitability as a model of PT damage and disease.

Applications and limitations
PT-enhanced organoids represent a powerful model for a range of applications, such as
screening of drugs for nephrotoxic side effects, pharmaceutical efficacy testing, discovery
of novel treatments for proximal tubular diseases, modeling of inherited or acquired
diseases with a proximal tubular dysfunction phenotype, kidney developmental studies,
and bioengineering approaches to disease treatment. However, PT-enhanced organoids face
some limitations that are similarly shared with existing standard organoids. Overall immaturity
and inability to culture kidney organoids long term to achieve structural and functional
maturation are currently key limitations of the model. Despite displaying improved maturity,
some important transporters show low expression levels in PT-enhanced organoids, such as
SLC22A2/OCT2 and SLC22A6/OAT1, highlighting the need for ongoing culture optimization.
Differentiation toward off-target cell types is also recurrent in standard and PT-enhanced
kidney organoids. A diverse range of non-kidney cell types arise during hPSC differentiation to
kidney organoids, such as neural, muscle and cartilage lineages50–52. In PT-enhanced organoids,
the characteristic spatially arranged and proximalized nephrons arise from a self-established
centralized core of WNT antagonism, which possesses a pre-cartilage population in addition
to cortical stroma6. Such off-target populations are likely to be problematic for translation
of this protocol to clinical applications and it is currently unknown whether the organoid
cell endpoints would be different overall if the nephron progenitor specification steps
described here were to be incorporated into other kidney organoid protocols. Finally, while
proximalized nephrons of improved maturity will be of great benefit for a range of disease
research applications, they may not be suitable for approaches requiring the presence of more
distal nephron segments beyond the loop of Henle. PT-enhanced organoids possess little
GATA3 expression, suggesting limited patterning to distal connecting segment6. The current
inability to simultaneously generate all kidney cell populations in a single differentiation step
remains a challenge within the kidney organoid field as a whole and further limits nephron
development1,2,5,48,49. Critical interactions between cell populations such as ureteric bud or
nephron progenitors and stroma compartments or the developing nephron53–55 are lacking
in the organoid environment, thus impacting correct nephron patterning, structure and
elongation.

Experimental design
hPSC passaging and expansion in preparation for differentiation
This protocol has been successfully applied to a range of human iPSCs6, as well as human ESCs
(unpublished). The current protocol depicts results generated using two iPSC lines (detailed in
‘Reagents’), cultured feeder free in TesR-Essential 8(E8) medium with the support of Matrigel
(Steps 1–9). Passaging is performed at 80% confluency, 2 d before (day −2) differentiation
induction, at a 1:3 split ratio to ensure adequate numbers of cells in the exponential growth
phase before seeding (Fig. 2).
