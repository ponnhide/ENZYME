spatial organization. This arises from a centralized WNT signaling gradient originating from
the organoids’ dense core of cortical stroma and pre-cartilage cells, producing elongated and
aligned nephrons that radiate outward from a central ring of glomeruli6.

Alternative methods
The critical role of the PT in renal function and its vulnerability to nephrotoxic insult has
led to a wide range of approaches to generate in vitro PT models. Originally focussing on
the development of primary and immortalized adult PT cell lines, such as HK-2 (ref. 24),
HKC11/HKC8 (ref. 25), HPTC-05-CLA (ref. 26) and PTEC-TERT1 (ref. 27), more recent studies
have generated PT-like populations via transcriptional reprogramming of fibroblasts and
hiPSC-directed differentiation28–31. However, two-dimensional static cultures of such PT cells
face limitations including de-differentiation, low transporter expression levels and loss of their
polarized columnar cell morphology25,32–34. To better recapitulate physiological PT conditions,
apical sheer stress has been applied to adult PT cell monolayers35–38, while other approaches
have applied 3D culture techniques to promote tubule formation (with or without flow) using
PT cell lines, isolated adult kidney tubule cells and iPSC/kidney organoid-derived PT cells39–45.
These studies have reported similar improvements in the functional expression of some apical/
basolateral transporters, tight junction formation, selective substrate uptake and improved
nephrotoxic response compared with PT lines under static conditions. However, compared with
human PT in vivo, PT identity in vitro remains suboptimal, showing low or absent expression
of several critical transporters, heterogeneous expression of markers from other nephron
segments, or incomplete recapitulation of PT cell populations for the three PT segments
(S1–S3). Furthermore, techniques and culture formats used to improve PT cell identity can
