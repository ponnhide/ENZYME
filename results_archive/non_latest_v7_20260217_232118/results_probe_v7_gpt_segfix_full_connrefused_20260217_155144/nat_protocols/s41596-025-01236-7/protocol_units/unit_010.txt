0.5 mM EDTA dissociation solution
Using a brand new unopened 500-ml PBS, 1× without calcium and magnesium bottle, add 500 µl
of UltraPure 0.5 M EDTA to make the 0.5 mM EDTA dissociation solution for hPSC passaging.
The bottle can be stored at room temperature (20–22 °C) for ≤12 months.

hNPSR-v2 medium
Once the individual component stocks are properly prepared as outlined above, thaw the
aliquots of component stocks and use them to prepare 100 ml of complete hNPSR-v2 medium
by referring to Table 4. All stock aliquots can be used for the preparation of 100 ml of complete
hNPSR-v2 medium, except for 10 mM A83-01 stock (first stock), which needs to be further
diluted by mixing 1µl of 10 mM A83-01 with 199 μl of DMEM/F12 medium to make a 50 μM
A83-01 stock solution (second stock). The thawed stock medium components have different
shelf-lives. For growth factors, it is best to store them at 4 °C and use them within 2 weeks. For
small molecules, including the second stock of A83-01, they are good for ≤1 month at 4 °C.
The complete hNPSR-v2 medium can be stored at 4 °C for 2 weeks.

10% (vol/vol) FBS medium
10% (vol/vol) FBS medium is used for neutralizing the Accumax dissociation reaction during
iNPC passaging. An example of the preparation of 500 ml of complete 10% (vol/vol) FBS medium
is shown in Table 5. The complete 10% (vol/vol) FBS medium can be stored at 4 °C for 2 months.

FACS medium
Supplement PBS with 2% (vol/vol) FBS. For example, to prepare 100 ml of FACS medium, add 2 ml
of FBS into 98 ml of PBS and mix well. Make fresh FACS medium for use. Store temporarily at 4 °C
or on ice.

Matrigel stock
Thaw the whole bottle of 5 ml of Cultrex RGF basement membrane extract (R&D Systems,
cat. no. 3433010-01) on ice overnight. On the second day, when the Matrigel is completely
