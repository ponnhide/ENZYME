Protocol

long-term culture, iNPCs tend to decrease the expression of PAX2, a transcription factor that is
well established in kidney development on the basis of mouse genetics studies1,43. Interestingly,
decreased expression of PAX2 appears not to affect iNPC differentiation into nephron organoids
when following this protocol using Transwell culture. This is consistent with a prior observation
that PAX2-knockout hPSCs can differentiate into nephron organoids44. PAX8, a paralog of
PAX2 that shares similar transcriptional activity45, is highly expressed in iNPCs, probably
compensating for PAX2 reduction over time. Nevertheless, limitations may exist for using the
iNPC model to study the function of PAX2 in human kidney development and its dysfunction in
the development of congenital kidney diseases.
 Compared to standard hPSC-derived nephron organoids7,8 without an NPC purification
step, purified iNPC line–derived nephron organoids show dramatically reduced off-target
cells as expected (0.67% as shown by single-cell multiome analysis28). Interestingly, podocytes
reproducibly dominate the nephron cell types found in iNPC-derived nephron organoids (on
the basis of different batches of experiments, 70–90% are podocytes, while 10–30% are tubules).
Because this biased podocyte differentiation is evident in iNPC lines at both early and late
passages, this phenomenon probably reflects an intrinsic bias from the use of purified iNPCs for
differentiation. Future efforts are warranted to understand the underlying mechanisms and to
modify the iNPC differentiation protocol to generate a nephron organoid with the presence of
balanced nephron cell types, especially the improvement of nephron tubule formation. Thus,
current iNPC-derived nephron organoids are not ideal for modeling diseases in which tubules
are the primary sites of pathology.
 Compared to a complex kidney in vivo, both iNPC-derived nephron organoids and hPSCderived nephron organoids share a few common limitations, such as insufficient nephron
patterning as seen in vivo (e.g., frequent formation of scattered but not continuous nephron
segments and lack of a cortical-medullary axis), immaturity of nephron tubules (e.g., proximal
tubule cells do not express high levels of transporters essential for kidney functions, such as the
organic anion/cation transporters, and loop of Henle cells do not express uromodulin/UMOD)
and the lack of major kidney cell types within the nephron lineage (e.g., SLC12A3+ distal
convoluted tubule) and beyond the nephron lineage (collecting duct, stroma, vasculature and
neuronal systems).

Overview of the procedure
hPSCs are routinely cultured in mTeSR Plus medium (Steps 1–9) and then differentiated into
iNPCs by using a three-stage protocol in 10 d (Steps 10–30). For hPSC lines that have an NPCspecific reporter (e.g., SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry dual reporter), differentiated iNPCs are purified
by FACS (Step 31A); for hPSC lines without an NPC-specific reporter, differentiated cells are
cultured in hNPSR-v2 medium, which will lead to enrichment of the iNPC population over a few
passages (Step 31B); for hPSC lines without an NPC-specific reporter, in which the differentiated
cells have a lot of off-target cells, cell surface marker integrin subunit-α 8 (ITGA8) is used to
enrich iNPCs (Step 31C). The purified or enriched iNPCs can be cultured stably in hNPSR-v2
medium for expansion (Steps 32–41) or cryopreserved for long-term storage (Steps 42–44).
Cultured iNPCs should be routinely characterized by immunostaining every four to five
passages (2–3 weeks) to verify iNPC identity and purity (Steps 45–52). Cultured iNPCs can
differentiate into nephron organoids in a six-well Transwell plate in three phases within 21 d
(Steps 53–64). The quality of nephron organoid generation can be assessed by immunostaining
and RT-qPCR (Step 65).

Experimental design
Maintenance of hPSCs
The hPSCs are routinely maintained in feeder-free conditions in commercially available mTeSR
Plus medium (STEMCELL Technologies). Routine testing for mycoplasma is performed, and
hPSCs are discarded if they test positive. Extracellular matrix Matrigel and various Matrigel
alternatives have been used to coat the plates for the expansion of hPSCs. In this manuscript,
although we still use the term ‘Matrigel’ to indicate the extracellular matrix, we actually use
