Protocol

Alternative methods
Multiple protocols have described the generation of hPSC-derived iNPCs, transitioning
sequentially through mesoderm, intermediate mesoderm and posterior intermediate
mesoderm, recapitulating normal kidney organogenesis7,8,22. However, in these protocols,
these iNPCs are transient and are induced to undergo MET to generate nephron structures
immediately after they are formed. Direct reprogramming38 (or trans-differentiation) from
fibroblasts to nephron progenitor-like cells through the forced expression of NPC-specific
transcription factors has also been reported39,40. In addition, culture conditions have been
described to expand hPSC-derived iNPCs for a short period of time (up to two passages,
or 14 d)41,42. Compared to these alternative methods to produce nephron progenitor-like
cells in vitro, the protocol described here can stably expand hPSC-derived iNPCs for several
months with high purity (90–95% SIX2+) and retained nephrogenic potential, allowing scalable
manufacturing of high-quality human iNPCs for regenerative medicine and other applications.
Importantly, transcriptome analysis of the iNPCs cultured in hNPSR-v2 medium indicated better
resemblance to primary human NPCs in vivo, as compared to the transient iNPCs generated
from hPSC differentiation. Nephron organoids have been generated from hPSCs transitioning
through the transient iNPCs6–22. Compared to these hPSC-derived nephron organoids,
cultured iNPC-derived nephron organoids show minimal off-target cell types and increased
nephron maturity, such as the formation of COL4A3+/COL4A4+ mature podocytes28. A recent
publication20 used an improved iNPC specification step from the standard nephron organoid
protocol8 and demonstrated significant enhancement of proximal tubule segmentation and
maturity, which is consistent with our observation that NPCs with higher quality will be able to
generate more mature nephrons.

Application
The ability to manufacture near-pure human iNPCs presents an unprecedented opportunity to
study human kidney development, disease and regeneration. We showed in a proof-of-concept
genome-wide CRISPR screen in cultured mouse NPCs that candidate genes regulating NPC
self-renewal can be unbiasedly identified, with implications in congenital kidney disease and
Wilms tumor development28. Similar genome-scale screening or omics approaches can be
applied to in vitro accessible human iNPCs to understand human NPC biology. We showed that
genome editing can be performed directly in iNPC lines, allowing rapid genetic modifications in
iNPCs and assessment of their functional consequences in nephron organoids. As an example,
we showed that polycystic kidney disease 2 gene-knockout (PKD2−/−) iNPCs are expandable
and can reproducibly and highly efficiently generate cystic nephron organoids recapitulating
the disease phenotype28. By following a similar approach, other disease-related genetic
modifications can be introduced to the iNPC lines to generate novel models of kidney diseases.
We also showed that hNPSR-v2 medium was able to reprogram hPSC-derived podocytes or
primary podocytes isolated from human fetal kidneys to an NPC-like state, revealing previously
unknown podocyte plasticity28. This in vitro model offers an opportunity to understand the
detailed molecular mechanisms underlying kidney cell plasticity in the future. Compared
to hPSC-derived nephron organoids, podocytes generated from the iNPC-derived nephron
organoids show higher expression of mature podocyte marker genes such as COL4A3 and
COL4A4, offering a potential tool to model glomerular diseases that cannot be recapitulated
with current podocyte models that do not express these genes. However, it is important to
consider the following limitations before using this model to study glomerular diseases:
(i) these iNPC-derived nephron organoids are not vascularized, preventing the modeling
of glomerular filtration as in a perfused glomerulus in vivo; and (ii) whether specialized
podocyte structures (e.g., slit diaphragm) are properly formed in this in vitro model remains
to be determined.

Limitations
It is important to note that although cultured iNPCs are similar to primary human NPCs in global
gene expression and in developmental potential, some differences still exist. For example, upon
