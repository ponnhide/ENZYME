organoids failed to grow beyond 1–1.5 mm in diameter while cultured in 96-well plates even
after an extended propagation in FGF2- and EGF-containing medium. To promote further tissue
growth, we adopted the approach developed by Lancaster and Knoblich27 and embedded
SNR-derived organoids into Matrigel (MG) droplets (Fig. 5a). Following MG embedding, we
observed notable transformations, including substantial tissue growth, migration of cells into
MG and extensive radiation of fibers (Fig. 5b,c). Organoids continued expanding in MG during
the next 4 months of culture, reaching the size of 3–5 mm in diameter by ~5 months postinduction (~4 months post-embedding) (Fig. 5d–g). Between 3 and 4 months post-embedding,
we treated organoids with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT3)
and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (Fig. 1) to promote neuronal survival, maturation
and synapse development62,63. Our reasoning for applying these factors later in differentiation,
as opposed to early in the process28,37,64,65, was that at later stages the trophic factors are more
suitable for promoting synaptic development. Furthermore, we applied these factors later to
minimize the risk of premature or ectopic neuronal differentiation.
