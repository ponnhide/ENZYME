Procedure
 CRITICAL Perform all steps under a clean bench.
 c

 1 Clean the micromanipulator with 70% ethanol (eEtOH) and place it under the clean bench.
 2 Prepare ﬁne glass capillary pipettes (e.g., with DMZ Universal Electrode Puller). Check if the opening is still accessible by sucking and releasing
 DMEM/F12. Prepare at least four thin capillaries for each organoid since they break easily, and each dye requires a fresh, unused capillary.
 3 Prepare 1:1 (vol/vol) dilutions CTB-488 or CTB-647 in DMEM/F12 in sterile 1.5 ml microtubes and protect them from light.
 4 Place a 10 µl drop of Matrigel near an edge of a sterile glass slide and let the Matrigel solidify.
 5 Collect OVB organoids of day 60 and place them on the Matrigel drop on the sterile glass slide. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for
 transferring organoids.
 6 Remove excess medium carefully. Leave a thin ﬁlm or small drop of liquid around the organoid to ensure it does not dry out.
 7 Place glass slide with organoids on the stage holder of a stereomicroscope under the clean bench.
 8 Move the microinjector close to the organoids on the microscope stage holder.
 9 Fill glass capillary tip with 3 µl of CTB-488 dilution (front ﬁll) and move the needle tip forward in front of the ﬁrst pigmented area. Inject the
 solution into the ﬁrst OV carefully, using a microscope. Try not to injure the OV or the surrounding tissue and avoid making air bubbles.
10 Move the microinjector tip backward and replace the tip with a new thin glass tip.
 CRITICAL STEP Add one drop of OVB medium on the organoid to prevent it from drying out.
 c

 11 Fill glass pipette tip with 3 µl of CTB-647 dilution and repeat step 8 with the second pigmented area.
12 Transfer the injected organoids into a well of a 24-well plate for suspension culture and expose the plate to normal room light for 10 min.
 13 After light exposure, culture the plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.
14 After 24 h incubation, collect CTB-injected OVB organoids in a sterile 1 ml tube. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for transferring organoids.
15 Carefully remove any carried-over medium with a 200 µl micropipette tip without disturbing the organoids.
16 Wash organoids once with 1 ml of prewarmed DMEM/F12 for 3 min and remove the DMEM/F12.
 CRITICAL STEP Protect organoids from light in all of the following steps.
 c

17 Add 1 ml of 4% PFA, prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath, and incubate the tube at RT for 30–60 min.
 CRITICAL STEP Do not exceed the time of PFA ﬁxation above 1 h because this will lead to high autoﬂuorescence.
 c

18 Clear the tissue as described previously10. First, dehydrate the PFA-ﬁxed organoid sequentially in graded EtOH series of 30% (vol/vol) EtOH,
 50% (vol/vol) EtOH, 75% (vol/vol) EtOH and 100% (vol/vol) EtOH. For each step, gently shake organoids in a 1 ml tube for 30 min at 4 °C,
 always protected from light.
19 Clear the organoids with ethyl cinnamate (ECI) for 30 min at RT, protected from light. After successful clearing, organoids will display only the
 pigmented areas, and the brain part will be transparent.
 CRITICAL STEP Without tissue clearing, it is impossible to detect clear signals from the ﬂuorescent-tagged CTBs inside the organoid and get
 c

 satisfying 3D images.
20 Place organoid in ECI with a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip into coverslip bottom µ-slides protected from light.
 PAUSE POINT Organoids can be stored in the ECI at 4 °C protected from light until 3D imaging. Do not exceed storing for more than
 j

 2 weeks including step 22.
21 Perform additional staining using the blue (405) or the red channel (594), e.g., for DAPI staining (405) and/or IF (594).
 PAUSE POINT Store CTB-injected, tissue cleared and stained organoids for no longer than 2 weeks in total at 4 °C protected from light,
 j

 since ﬂuorophore signals might fade after this time.
22 Perform 3D imaging of an OVB organoid using a confocal microscope. We use a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with EC Plan-Neoﬂuor
 10×/0.3 and Plan-Apochromat 20×/0.8 M27 objectives. Place organoid into the center of the µ-slide chamber and orient the OVB organoid so
 that the pigmented areas are facing to the side of the µ-slide chamber. Start following trajectories from OVs into the inside of the organoid.
23 Export raw ﬁles to software Imaris x64 version 7.7.1 to perform surface and volume rendering. For details, see the manufacturer´s instructions.
24 Process obtained ﬁles further using Image J, Adobe photoshop CC 2017, and Adobe Illustrator CC 2017.
