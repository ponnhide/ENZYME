 Adult stem cell–based organoid technology is a versatile tool for the generation and long-term maintenance of near-native
 3D epithelial tissues in vitro. The generation of cancer organoids from primary patient material enables a range of
 therapeutic agents to be tested in the resulting organoid cultures. Patient-derived cancer organoids therefore hold great
 promise for personalized medicine. Here, we provide an overview of the protocols used by different groups to establish
 organoids from various epithelial tissues and cancers, plus the different protocols subsequently used to test the in vitro
 therapy sensitivity of these patient-derived organoids. We also provide an in-depth protocol for the generation of head
 and neck squamous cell carcinoma organoids and their subsequent use in semi-automated therapy screens. Establishment
 of organoids and subsequent screening can be performed within 3 months, although this timeline is highly dependent on a.
 o. starting material and the number of therapies tested. The protocol provided may serve as a reference to successfully
 establish organoids from other cancer types and perform drug screenings thereof.

 Introduction
 The development of organoid technology opens new avenues for testing and development of ther-
 apeutic approaches in a pre-clinical setting. Generated from various types of stem cells, derived from
 different tissues and even different species, organoids are 3D structures that closely recapitulate tissue
 architecture and cellular composition1. Organoid cultures can be maintained long term while
 retaining genetic stability1. Generally established from both healthy and diseased tissue, adult stem
 cell–derived organoids consist of epithelial cells and provide an opportunity to expand patient-
 derived cells in the laboratory. Adult stem cell–derived organoids are a good model to study tissue
 homeostasis and regeneration. Pluripotent stem cell–derived organoids are better suited to study
 organ development and can (depending on the differentiation protocol applied) contain cell types
 derived from all three germ layers2. As a result, and in contrast to adult stem cell–derived organoids,
 pluripotent stem cell–derived organoids can contain both epithelial and non-epithelial cells.
 A large collection of protocols to generate organoids from different tissues has been established3–29.
 Researchers have begun to investigate whether these cultures are amenable to (high-throughput)
 drug-screening procedures that would allow testing of in vitro sensitivity to various compounds.
 Often, such screens are designed to model clinically applied therapeutic regimens. To assess the
 predictive potential of these patient-derived organoids, patient responses have been compared to the
 matched patient-derived organoid response9,11,19,30,31. The results obtained to date indicate that the
 in vitro response of patient-derived organoids is, in most cases, predictive for patient response to
 therapy30,32. As such, organoid technology has the potential to predict patient response, thereby
 holding great promise for personalized medicine.
 Here, we describe a general protocol for the establishment of patient-derived organoids. This
 protocol can be applied to a range of epithelial tissues. Our guidelines are based on previously
 published protocols, used by both our research group and others. We describe how these organoids
 may be applied in therapy screens, where both the seeding of organoids into 384-well plates and the
 exposure to chemotherapeutics are performed in a semi-automated fashion (Fig. 1a). In general,
 functional tests (such as the swelling assay applied to patient-derived intestinal organoids to assess
 responsiveness to cystic ﬁbrosis drugs33) can be easily performed in organoids to assess responses to

 Although the timeline for execution of this protocol is highly dependent on the starting material, the
 number of therapies tested and other variables, the establishment of organoids and subsequent
 screening can typically be performed within 3 months.
 When in vitro drug screening is performed using different experimental methods (different
 reagents, machines, readouts or protocols) and data analysis approaches, different absolute data
 points may be obtained34–36. However, others have shown that these inconsistencies can be mini-
 mized when drug screen responses are assessed as discrete values (i.e., trends) rather than as absolute
 values such as IC50 or area under the curve (AUC)37. In general, it is believed that the robustness of
 drug-screening data will increase when both screening methods and data analysis become more
 standardized. Others have investigated the variables that contribute most to data robustness and,
 thus, are most important to control when performing in vitro drug screens34,36,37. Although touched
 upon in this protocol, as we recommend using good laboratory practice guidelines that increase data
 robustness, an in-depth discussion of these variables is beyond the scope of this paper. Regardless, we
 hope this paper will contribute to the standardization of the screening methodology, which will make
 it easier to compare screening results between experiments, organoid cultures and even laboratories
 and different researchers.

 Overview of organoid culture methods
 Generation of epithelial organoid cultures
 Adult stem cell–derived organoids were ﬁrst generated from mouse intestinal epithelial stem cells
 (marked by the expression of Lgr5)27. Shortly after, the ﬁrst patient-derived organoids were estab-
 lished from adult human intestinal epithelial cells20,27. Protocols were subsequently adapted to grow
 organoids from other epithelial tissues (both healthy and diseased)38. Adult stem cell–based organoid
 technology is now widely used as a method to culture patient-speciﬁc cells in vitro. The approach can
 be used to generate collections of patient-derived cultures, or so called ‘living biobanks’39, that
 represent the heterogeneity of the disease of interest.
 Although protocols to establish organoids from primary tissue may differ depending on the
 epithelial tissue of origin, the source of tissue (normal or tumor), and the research group that
 established the method, general principles can be deﬁned (Table 1)5,6,8,9,11,14,16,18–22,29,30,38–57. Note
 that Table 1 includes studies that demonstrated organoid establishment from patient material that
 allowed culture maintenance for >10 passages.
 Organoids can be generated from solid surgical resection material (Fig. 1b), from smaller solid
 needle or punch biopsies30,58, nasal brush samples59, transurethral resections5 or ﬂuid samples such as
 urine29, ascites50 or broncho-alveolar lavage ﬂuid48. For solid tissue, the ﬁrst step is to remove as
 much non-epithelial tissue (such as muscle or fat) as possible (Fig. 1c). Typically, primary tissue is
 subsequently cut into small fragments (e.g., 1−3 mm3) using a scalpel, followed by enzymatic
 digestion to liberate the epithelial cells from the tissue. This dissociation results in single cells or small
 clumps of cells, which are plated in a 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel such as basement
 membrane extract (BME), Matrigel or Geltrex. The ECM hydrogel serves as an artiﬁcial lamina
 propria (Fig. 1d), and its use in organoid cultures was derived from an approach pioneered by Mina
 Bissell60. After plating, these cells are provided with a culture medium consisting of a growth factor
 cocktail known to trigger a regenerative (injury) response in the stem cells of the pertinent epithelium
 (Supplementary Table 1). Key components of this cocktail are generally: (i) activators of Wnt sig-
 naling, such as the Wnt ligand and the LGR5 ligand R-spondin (RSPO)27,61,62; (ii) ligands of tyrosine
 receptor kinases such as epidermal growth factor (EGF)63,64, known to promote epithelial pro-
 liferation; and (iii) inhibitors of transforming growth factor-β/bone morphogenetic protein signaling
 such as Noggin65, as this signaling pathway is known to induce epithelial differentiation. The

 respective medium composition (and thus signaling components required to grow the organoids)
 differs by tissue of origin. This procedure results in the formation of closed epithelial structures with a
 central lumen (in the case of non-stratiﬁed epithelia such as the colon epithelium) that is lined by the
 apical surface of the organoid cells. The outside organoid surface, which is formed by the basal side of
 the cells, expresses integrins and contacts the ECM hydrogel. The kinetics of organoid formation
 depends on the tissue of origin (Fig. 1e).
 Organoids can be established from a wide range of normal and tumor epithelial cells (examples are
 given in Fig. 1f) and can subsequently be expanded and cryo-preserved. Supplementary Table 1 gives
 an overview of the components of the culture media used by different laboratories to grow organoids
 derived from different tissues5,8,9,11,14,16,18–22,29,30,38–41,43–51,55,57,66,67. Note that Supplementary
 (human) patient-derived adult stem cell–derived organoids and show long-term culture (>10 pas-
 sages). Therefore, studies that use previously reported media compositions are not included in the
 conditions and use organoid systems based on ECM hydrogels such as BME or Matrigel. A detailed
 overview of the entire isolation procedure that was just described (exempliﬁed for organoids derived
 from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)), is given in Fig. 2.

 Screening of organoid cultures for sensitivity to therapeutic agents
 Different research groups have performed drug screens on patient-derived organoids (see Table 2 for
 an overview of the drug-screening protocols used)5,6,8,9,11,12,19,30–32,39,40,42,43,47–50,52–54,56–58,66–74.
 Although differences between these protocols exist (drug exposure timing, organoid size, timing of
 treatment start relative to the seeding of the organoids and the ECM hydrogel used), the applied
 procedures are overall similar. Details of the protocols used by different groups and for organoids
 derived from different tissues are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 includes studies that report on the
