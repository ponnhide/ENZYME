Procedure
 Colon organoid seeding ● Timing 3 d (organoid growth); 2–3 h (organoid seeding)
 1 Set up the centrifuge to accommodate 15 ml conical tubes, and cool down to 4 °C.
 CRITICAL Centrifuge needs to be at 4 °C for Step 9.

 c
 2 Sterilize biosafety cabinet using PREempt disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol (vol/vol).
 3 Obtain a bucket of ice.
 4 Thaw an appropriate number of Matrigel aliquots in a 4 °C fridge (1.2 ml Matrigel is required for a
 full 24-well plate of organoids droplets).
 CRITICAL Matrigel needs to be thawed before Step 11.
 c
 5 Prepare base medium, colon organoid growth medium and washing medium as described in
 organoid growth medium is required.
 6 Obtain a cryovial of organoids from the liquid nitrogen tank, and place it into a 37 °C water bath.
 Hold in the water bath until thawed (~1 min).
 7 Bring the cryovial into the biosafety cabinet after spaying the outer surface with 70% ethanol.
 8 Add 1 ml of washing medium to the cryovial, resuspend the organoids gently and then transfer the
 content of the cryotube to the 15 mL conical tube that already contains 10 ml of washing medium.
 Fill the tube with additional washing medium up to 15 ml.
 9 Centrifuge at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. During centrifugation, prepare the material for the subsequent
 steps: sterilize a glass dish with PREempt disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol. Add ice to 50–70%
 capacity of the glass dish, spray with 70% ethanol again and place the dish into the biosafety
 cabinet. Put Matrigel aliquots into the aluminum cooling block. Spray thoroughly with 70%
 ethanol, and place gently into the glass dish containing ice.
 CRITICAL Ice is not sterile; use with extra caution in the biosafety cabinet.
 c

 10 After centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant (washing medium) with vacuum using a sterile
 Pasteur pipette.
 11 Resuspend the organoid pellet with 1.2 ml of Matrigel and seed 50 µl droplets into each well of an
 Olympus 24-well, tissue culture treated plate.
 CRITICAL It is important to use Olympus 24-well tissue culture treated plates as they keep the
 c

 Matrigel droplets spherical, which is critical for 3D organoid growth.
 12 Carefully transfer the plate(s) containing Matrigel droplets to the CO2 incubator. Incubate for
 15–20 min to allow Matrigel gelation. After 15–20 min, check the Matrigel gelation by tilting the
 plates. If the Matrigel holds ﬁrm, they should be ready.
 13 Place the plate(s) inside the biosafety cabinet and add 600 µl of colon organoid medium to each
 well. Carefully dispense the medium into the side of the well to avoid disturbing the Matrigel
 droplet. At this point, organoids will be small. In some cases, it is possible to see fragmented
 organoids with an inverted bright-ﬁeld microscope.
 14 After 3 d of culture, observe under an inverted microscope to ensure organoids have increased in
 size (>100 μm in diameter), and proceed with the organoid passaging protocol (e.g., if thawed on
 Friday, passage on Monday).

 Colon organoid passaging ● Timing 7 d cycle (organoid growth); 4–5 h (organoid
 passaging)
 CRITICAL Organoids should be passaged at a 7 d cycle (e.g., passage organoids every Monday). Avoid
 c

 culturing organoids for more than 15 consecutive passages after thawing.
 15 Set up the centrifuge to accommodate 15 ml conical tubes, and cool down to 4 °C.
 CRITICAL Centrifuge needs to be at 4 °C for Steps 21 and 25.
 c

 16 Repeat Steps 2 and 3.
 17 Check the organoid droplets under an inverted microscope to evaluate if the size of most organoids
 is >100 µm in diameter or larger. Estimate the split ratio to use for passaging organoids to calculate
 the amount of Matrigel to thaw.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 18 Thaw an appropriate number of Matrigel aliquots in a 4 °C fridge (1.2 ml Matrigel is required for a
 full 24-well plate of organoids droplets). Thaw 1.2 ml additional Matrigel in case a higher split ratio
 will be used.
 CRITICAL Matrigel needs to be thawed before Step 27. Thaw extra Matrigel ahead in case higher
 c

 splitting ratio is needed in Step 27.

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 19 Prepare colon organoid growth medium (15 ml for every 24-well plate) by ﬁrst making up base
 medium, as described in Table 2, and then using this as a component of colon organoid growth
 medium, made as described in Table 3. Alternatively, this medium can be prepared during CRS
 incubation (Step 24).
 20 Collect organoid droplets using the medium in which they are currently growing. Using a 1,000 µl
 pipette, set the pipette to 650 µl (there should be a maximum volume in each well of 50 µl Matrigel
 and 600 µl medium). Scrape the bottom of the well with the pipette tip to dislodge the Matrigel
 droplet before drawing up the medium. Place medium and organoids into a 15 ml conical tube. One
 24-well plate of organoids should ﬁt into one 15 ml conical tube.
 CRITICAL Allow space beneath the pipette tip when drawing up the Matrigel suspension (do not
 c
 press against bottom of the well). If an obvious amount of Matrigel droplet remains, adhered to the
 plate after drawing up the medium, return the medium to the well and repeat scraping to dislodge
 the remaining Matrigel. Small fragments of the Matrigel droplet will likely remain stuck to the plate
 even after repeating the procedure. As long as ≥90% of the droplet is collected, that is acceptable, as
 negligible number of organoids will be left behind in these small fragments.
 21 Centrifuge the collected Matrigel droplets at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, there
 should be ~1 ml Matrigel pellet per 24-well plate of organoid droplets collected.
 22 Aspirate the supernatant (spent organoid growth medium) with vacuum using a sterile Pasteur
 pipette.
 23 Resuspend the Matrigel pellet in CRS using a 1:10 dilution. For a full 24-well plate of organoids, use
 12 ml of CRS. Resuspend the Matrigel droplet by gently inverting the 15 ml conical tube.
 CRITICAL Do not resuspend the droplet by repeated pipetting as organoid will adhere to the
 c

 serological pipette and there might be some organoid loss.
 24 Incubate the resuspended Matrigel in the ice bucket for 45–60 min, or until Matrigel is dissolved.
 Mix the Matrigel–CRS solution via gentle inversion every 10–15 min. Organoids will settle at the
 bottom of the tube when Matrigel is fully dissolved.
 CRITICAL Do not exceed 60 min of incubation as this can decrease cell viability. Do not vortex
 c

 the organoid suspension.
 25 Centrifuge at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, there should be a noticeable organoid
 pellet, ~200 µl volume of organoid, depending on the density of the original culture. During
 centrifugation, prepare the material for the subsequent steps: sterilize a glass dish with PREempt
 disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol. Add ice to 50–70% capacity of the glass dish, spray with 70%
 ethanol again and place the dish into the biosafety cabinet. Put Matrigel aliquots into the aluminum
 cooling block. Spray thoroughly with 70% ethanol, and place it into the glass dish containing
 the ice.
 CRITICAL Ice is not sterile; use with extra caution in the biosafety cabinet.
 c

 26 Aspirate CRS using vacuum and a sterile Pasteur pipette. After aspiration, place the conical tube
 into the glass dish containing ice.
 CRITICAL Remove the CRS as much as possible, as remaining CRS could decrease the cell
 c

 viability and compromise the integrity of the Matrigel matrix.
 27 Calculate the volume needed for the desired splitting ratio allowing 50 μl of Matrigel per well
 (i.e., 1.2 ml Matrigel per 24-well plate). A typical splitting ratio is 1:3 to 1:5, but this varies and
 depends on the density of the original culture, length of culture since original thaw, and donor
 intrinsic growth behavior.
 28 Keep the tube on ice, and resuspend the organoid pellet in a maximum of 1 ml of Matrigel. If the
 total volume required is <1 ml, add the required volume; for example, if 900 µl is needed to achieve
 the desired splitting ratio, add 900 µl.
 CRITICAL Initially, 1 ml is added since a larger volume makes it harder to dissociate the
 c

 organoids and leads to a more diverse organoid fragment size.
 29 Bend a 1,000 µl pipette tip by pressing down the pipette tip on the inside of the cap for the conical
 tube. Use this bent tip to pipette the Matrigel suspension 25 times if organoids are in the ﬁrst
 passage after thawing. Otherwise pipette the Matrigel suspension 50 times. After resuspension,
 check the level of organoid fragmentation under an inverted microscope. If further dissociation is
 needed, return conical tube to ice in the biosafety cabinet, continue pipetting with bent pipette tip
 25 more times and reexamine under the microscope. Repeat until mostly fragments remain.
 CRITICAL Organoids are more fragile after the ﬁrst thawing and will be dissociated into
 c

 fragments much more easily. Do not observe organoid fragmentation under the microscope for
 >10 s to avoid Matrigel polymerization. If >10 s is needed to evaluate the level of organoid

 fragmentation, look at 10 s intervals, returning the tube to the ice bucket between intervals.
 An alternative approach is to take a 5–10 μl aliquot of the organoid–Matrigel mixture using a wide
 oriﬁce pipette tip, place the droplet on a microscope slide and assess organoid fragmentation.
 A Matrigel suspension with mostly organoid fragments is desired.
 30 Once organoids have been fragmented, add the remaining Matrigel needed (calculated in Step 27)
 to achieve the desired passaging ratio. Mix the Matrigel–organoid fragment suspension well before
 proceeding to the next step.
 31 Seed 50 µl droplets of the fragment suspension into each well of an Olympus 24-well, tissue culture
 treated plate.
 CRITICAL It is important to use Olympus 24-well, tissue culture treated plates as they maintain
 cspherical Matrigel droplets, which are critical for 3D organoid growth. Using Falcon tissue culture
 treated plates results in the spreading and ﬂattening of the Matrigel droplet. Alternatively, Falcon
 non-tissue culture treated plates may be used, but as these do not allow adhesion of the droplets,
 there is a high risk of the Matrigel droplets dislodging from the well and being aspirated when
 changing media.
 32 Carefully transfer the plate(s) containing Matrigel droplets to the CO2 incubator. Incubate the
 plates for 15–20 min to allow Matrigel gelation. After 15–20 min, check the Matrigel gelation by
 tilting the plates. If the Matrigel holds ﬁrm, they should be ready.
 33 Place the plate(s) in the biosafety cabinet. Add 600 µl of colon organoid medium to each well by
 carefully loading into the side of the well to avoid disturbing the Matrigel droplet.
 34 Incubate tissue culture plates in cell culture incubator at 37 °C, 95% air and 5% CO2 for 4 d (i.e., if
 passaged on Monday, move to next step to change medium on Friday).

 Colon organoid medium change ● Timing 0.5–1.5 h
 35 Sterilize biosafety cabinet with PREempt disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol.
 36 Prepare organoid growth medium (15 ml for every plate) according to Table 3. Medium should be
 prepared fresh each time, as the small molecules and proteins can become unstable if they remain in
 the medium for a long time.
 37 Carefully aspirate the medium from each of the wells using a vacuum aspirator and a sterile Pasteur
 pipette. When aspirating, tilt the plate toward yourself and press the pipette tip against the bottom
 of the well to avoid disrupting the Matrigel droplet adhered in the center of the well.
 38 Add 600 µl of medium per well by carefully loading into the side of the well to avoid disturbing the
 Matrigel droplet.
 39 Place plate back into incubator. Generally, organoids are ready for both passaging and monolayer
 seeding 3 d later (7 d after seeding).

 Colon monolayer seeding (single cells) ● Timing 4–6 h; 2.5 h (Transwell coating); 2–4 h
 (monolayer seeding)
 Transwell coating
 40 Obtain a bucket of ice, and keep the collagen I on ice
 41 Sterilize biosafety cabinet using PREempt disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol.
 42 Prepare a coating solution containing 50 µg/ml collagen I in PBS−/−. For 12-well Transwells, add
 300 µl of coating solution on the apical side and 1,200 µl on the basolateral side.
 43 Incubate the Transwells at 37 °C for at least 2 h to allow collagen coating to occur.

 Organoid collection, single cell dissociation and monolayer seeding
 44 Prepare colon monolayer seeding medium as described in Table 4. At least 2 ml should be made for
 each Transwell plus an additional 1–2 ml for cell counting. Alternatively, medium can be prepared
 during CRS incubation (Step 46).
 45 Collect organoids as described in Steps 20–23.
 46 After resuspending in CRS, incubate on ice for 45–60 min, or until Matrigel is dissolved. Resuspend
 the Matrigel via gentle inversion every 10–15 min, and proceed to the next step 15 min before the
 end of incubation.
 CRITICAL Do not exceed 60 min incubation time in CRS as this can decrease cell viability. The
 c

 trypsin/EDTA used in following steps will degrade most of any remaining matrix.
 47 With 15 min remaining for the CRS incubation, place a 1× Trypsin/EDTA aliquot into a 37 °C
 water bath.

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 48 Centrifuge organoids from Step 46 at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, there should be
 a noticeable organoid pellet, ~50–200 µl in size depending on the density of the original culture.
 49 During centrifugation, place prewarmed trypsin/EDTA and washing medium inside the biosafety
 cabinet. Make aliquots of 15 mL of washing medium. One 15 mL aliquot is needed per plate of
 organoid culture.
 50 After centrifugation, place the 15 ml conical tube containing the organoids inside the biosafety
 cabinet, and aspirate the CRS using vacuum and a sterile Pasteur pipette.
 CRITICAL While aspirating the CRS, slowly tip the 15 mL tube and avoid placing the Pasteur

 c
 pipette too close to the organoid pellet.
 51 Resuspend the organoid pellet in 1 ml prewarmed trypsin/EDTA via short and quick repeat
 pipetting. Incubate the organoid pellet in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min.
 CRITICAL Avoid completely drawing up the organoid suspension/pellet when adding trypsin/
 c

 EDTA. Organoids are very ‘sticky’ after CRS incubation, so drawing the whole suspension into the
 pipette tip will result in organoid loss.
 52 After incubation in trypsin/EDTA, take the 15 mL conical tube inside a biosafety cabinet to initiate
 single cell preparation. To break up the organoids, ﬁrst prewet a 1,000 μl pipette tip in washing
 medium, then bend the pipette tip by pressing the tip on the inside of the 15 ml conical tube cap.
 Finally, to dissociate the organoids and generate single cells, pipette the organoids 50 times and
 then inspect under the microscope for single cells. If a substantial number of organoids and/or
 fragments remains, pipette with a bent tip for an additional 50 times before evaluating again. Repeat
 cycles of pipetting 50 times until the suspension is primarily single cells.
 CRITICAL Pipette tip needs to be wet before bending. This will decrease the organoid adherence
 c

 to the pipette tip. Do not exceed 10 min total in trypsin/EDTA, because this will decrease cell
 viability. Even if the cells have not reached primarily single cells after 10 min of mechanical
 dissociation, proceed to next step. It is important to maintain the cell viability. Foaming might be
 present during single cell preparation, but it should not affect cell viability.
 With a new (nonbent) pipette tip, add washing medium to the cell suspension to neutralize the
 trypsin/EDTA. If cell dissociation resulted in a single-cell suspension in the previous step, use a
 serological pipette to add a sufﬁcient volume of washing medium to the cell suspension to reach
 15 ml. If cell dissociation did not reach single-cell suspension, add 1 ml of washing medium to the
 cell suspension, and continue pipetting with a bent pipette tip until a single-cell suspension is
 reached. Then, use a serological pipette to add a sufﬁcient volume of washing medium to the cell
 suspension to reach 15 ml.
 CRITICAL Do not mix with a serological pipette, as this results in cell loss.
 c

 53 Centrifuge single-cell suspension at 400g for 5 min at 4 °C.
 CRITICAL Make sure the centrifuge is at no higher than 800g to preserve high cell viability.
 c

 54 Aspirate and discard the supernatant using vacuum and a sterile Pasteur pipette.
 CRITICAL Leave ~50 µl of liquid at the bottom of the tube to avoid cell loss that occurs from
 c

 placing the Pasteur pipette too close to the cell pellet during aspiration.
 55 Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of colon monolayer seeding medium. Take a 15 µl aliquot of the
 cell suspension to determine cell density.
 CRITICAL Ensure the suspension is well mixed before taking the aliquot. Take 15 µl from the
 c

 middle of the cell suspension to make it as representative as possible of the entire suspension.
 56 Add 15 µl of Trypan Blue to the 15 µl aliquot cell suspension, and mix well via repeated pipetting.
 Count cells and assess viability by adding 10 µl of the suspension to each side of a disposable
 Countess chamber slide and inserting into Countess machine. Determine cell density from both
 sides of the slide, and record live cell density and % viability.
 ! CAUTION If there is a large discrepancy between the two cell counts, repeat cell counting with a
 new aliquot. An alternative protocol for cell counting is to use a hemocytometer following the
 manufacturer’s protocol for cell density determination.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 57 Calculate the total number of cells needed from the cell suspension to seed the desired number of
 monolayers. For 12-well Transwells inserts seed 3.0 × 105 cells per Transwell. Alternatively, in case
 of low density during single cell preparation, seed 2.5 × 105 cells per Transwell insert.
 58 From the original single cell preparation, transfer the volume of cells needed for seeding to a new
 15 ml conical tube. Add additional colon monolayer seeding medium to reach necessary density for
 seeding Transwells. For 12-well Transwells, 0.5 ml per well is needed, which is equivalent to a
 density of 6 × 105 cells/ml.

 59 Bring the coated Transwells from Step 43 from the incubator into the biosafety cabinet. Completely
 aspirate the coating solution from both sides of the Transwells. Rinse each Transwell at least once
 with PBS−/−. For 12-well Transwells, rinse with 1 ml on the apical side and 2 ml on the
 basolateral side.
 60 Mix the single cell suspension well via repeated pipetting to get it ready for seeding into Transwells.
 Remove the PBS−/− from the apical side of each Transwell insert prior to the addition of the cell
 suspension. For 12-well Transwells, add 0.5 ml of the cell suspension into the apical side.
 61 Add colon monolayer seeding medium to the basolateral side of each Transwell. For 12-well
 Transwells, add 1.5 ml of medium per Transwell.
 62 Place the seeded Transwells in a 37 °C incubator at 5% CO2. Inspect the Transwells every day under
 an inverted bright-ﬁeld microscope for conﬂuency.
 CRITICAL Colon cells are ﬂat and hard to see when attached to the Transwell membrane. As
 c

 time progresses, the tight junctions will be more visible under phase contrast. Proceed to next step
 to measure TEER for the ﬁrst time on day 3 after seeding. Typically, the ﬁrst medium change (to
 start differentiation) also occurs on day 3 after seeding (i.e., if seeded on Mondays, medium change
 and ﬁrst TEER measurement take place on Thursdays).

 Monolayer differentiation and TEER monitoring ● Timing 1–2 h
 CRITICAL This section describes how to monitor TEER using EndOhm cup chambers and epithelial
 c

 volt/ohm meter; while we have not tested alternative systems, it is likely they could be substituted,
 and the steps described here can be adapted for use with other systems. Independent of the instrument
 used to monitor TEER, ﬁrst sterilize the biosafety cabinet with PREempt disinfectant solution and
 70% ethanol.
 63 Make aliquots of base medium and PBS−/−. Typically, 45 ml of base medium and 40 ml of PBS−/−
 should be sufﬁcient for one 12-well plate of monolayers. Prewarm the aliquots in a 37 °C water bath
 for ~10 min.
 64 To disinfect the tweezers needed for Transwell manipulation during TEER measurement, prepare
 two 45 ml aliquots of 70% ethanol in 50 ml conical tubes.
 65 Place a pair of long tweezers in one of the 70% ethanol aliquots for sterilization.
 66 Prepare colon monolayer differentiation medium according to ‘Reagent setup’ and Table 5.
 CRITICAL Media should be freshly prepared whenever possible.
 c

 67 If the cover to the EndOhm cup chamber is held shut with tape or paraﬁlm, remove the cover.
 Spray the outer surface of the chamber and connecting wires thoroughly with 70% ethanol. Avoid
 getting excessive amounts of ethanol on the ends of the wire, as this can cause inaccurate
 measurements at later steps. Open the chamber, and spray 70% ethanol on both the bottom and
 inside of the cap.
 68 Bring the EndOhm chamber into the biosafety cabinet, leaving the end of the wire that connects to
 the Ohmmeter outside the cabinet.
 69 Place the Ohmmeter next to the biosafety cabinet (on a small, portable table), and connect the wire
 to the Ohmmeter. Keep the Ohmmeter turned off.
 70 Rinse the EndOhm chamber with 6 ml of 70% ethanol, and then ﬁll with 6 ml of fresh 70% ethanol
 and let it sit for at least 5 min.
 ! CAUTION Do not exceed 30 min in 70% ethanol. This could damage the wire contacts in the
 EndOhm chamber and lead to inaccurate measurements. For 12-well Transwells, 6 ml is sufﬁcient
 to ﬁll the chamber.
 71 Aspirate the 70% ethanol completely from the EndOhm chamber. Wash and rinse the chamber
 completely at least three times as follows: after removing the 70% ethanol, wash the EndOhm
 chamber once with 6 ml of prewarmed PBS−/−, then ﬁll the chamber with 6 ml of pre-warm
 PBS−/−. Let it sit for 2 min. Aspirate the PBS−/−, then wash again with 6 ml of PBS−/−. After this
 wash, add 3 ml of PBS−/− to the EndOhm chamber, place the top cover on top of the chamber and
 set aside.
 72 Turn on the Ohmmeter and record the background measurement when in PBS−/−. The
 background measurement will vary because of a wide range of factors, and readings from −5 Ω to
 +5 Ω are acceptable for the 12-well chamber.
 CRITICAL If the background measurement is abnormal, leave the system to sit and equilibrate in
 c

 PBS−/− for longer.

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 73 After recording the ohms background, aspirate the PBS−/− from the chamber. Rinse completely
 with 6 ml of prewarmed base medium at least three times.
 CRITICAL On the second rinse, let sit for 2 min to allow any remaining PBS−/− to leach out of

 c
 the wire contacts. On the ﬁnal rinse, add 2.5 ml of base medium needed in the chamber for TEER
 measurements.
 74 Remove tweezers/forceps from 70% ethanol. Allow the alcohol to evaporate from the forceps inside
 the biosafety cabinet, making sure the tweezers/forceps tips are away from any surface.
 75 Using a vacuum aspirator and Pasteur pipette, aspirate the medium from both apical and the
 basolateral side of the Transwells. Tilt the plate toward yourself, and aspirate with the pipette tip
 pressed against the bottom of the well in the basolateral side. Completely aspirate the basolateral
 side of every Transwell ﬁrst, then go back and aspirate the apical side of each Transwell. This order
 of aspiration is recommended by the Transwell manufacturers.
 CRITICAL Be very careful when aspirating the apical side of the Transwell. Do not completely
 c

 aspirate the apical side (leave ~50 µl), to avoid damaging the monolayer.
 CRITICAL If you wish to determine the proliferative state of the monolayer using EdU staining,
 c

 follow the instructions given in Box 1.
 76 Add base medium to the apical side of each Transwell. For 12-well Transwells, add 500 µl to the
 apical side.
 CRITICAL Dead/detached cells are expected to be ﬂoating on top of the monolayer at the ﬁrst
 c

 medium change (i.e., 3 d after seeding); hence, it is critical rinse the apical side with 500 µl of base
 medium once before adding fresh 500 µl of base medium. This extra rinse step will help remove
 dead cells and allow more stable TEER measurements.
 77 Add base medium to the basolateral side of the Transwells. For 12-well Transwells, add 1.5 ml to
 the basolateral side.
 78 Using the alcohol-sterilized and dried forceps, carefully pick up a Transwell and place it into the
 EndOhm chamber. Record the TEER measurement, then carefully place the Transwell back into the
 12-well plate. Repeat for all Transwells.
 CRITICAL Make sure the 70% alcohol is completely evaporated from the tweezers/forceps.
 c

 79 At the end of all TEER measurements, aspirate the medium from the basolateral side, and
 add colon monolayer differentiation medium. For 12-well Transwells, 1.5 ml colon monolayer
 differentiation medium is required per well.
 80 Return the monolayers to the incubator, and check the monolayers under an inverted microscope
 every day to inspect the conﬂuency. Repeat Steps 63–79 at preferred timepoints; we generally
 measure TEER on day 3 after seeding (i.e., if seeded on Mondays, TEER measurement take place on
 Thursdays). Proceed to the next step to prepare bacteria at day 4 after monolayer seeding, i.e., if
 seeded on Mondays, bacteria culture preparation starts on Fridays, so that the bacteria and
 monolayers will be ready for coculture at the same time.
 CRITICAL STEP The cultures are ready for coculture with bacteria (Step 92) when the TEER
 c

 values reaches ~ 200 Ω cm2 or higher, which generally occurs at ~day 3.

 Bacterial culture preparation
 81 Place the bacterial glycerol stocks in a cold metal block in an anaerobic workstation. If you wish to
 replicate our study10, use B. thetaiotaomicron strains MT768, MT798, MT799 and MT800.
 82 Use a disposable inoculating loop to scrape the top of the glycerol stock, and inoculate the scraped
 ice onto the YCFA agar plate, invert the agar plate, seal it into a plastic bag and place it into the
 incubator (37 °C) inside the anaerobic workstation for 24–36 h.
 83 After incubation for colony formation, use a disposable inoculating loop to pick one colony, and
 inoculate it into liquid YCFA medium (~7 ml) and place it into the incubator (37 °C) inside the
 anaerobic workstation for 24 h.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 84 The next day, subculture the bacteria using a 1:1,000 dilution, and let it grow overnight. Once it has
 been incubated overnight, the bacterial culture is ready to use.
 85 To determine the bacterial colony-forming unit (CFU) bring a 96-well plate into the anaerobic
 workstation, and add 90 µl of prereduced YCFA medium or DPBS+/+ buffer into each well.

 86 Use a 10 µl pipette to transfer 10 µl of bacterial culture into each well of the ﬁrst row (row A),
 mix thoroughly and make a serial dilution with rows A–H to cover dilution of 10−1 to 10−8
 (Supplementary Fig. 1).
 87 Use a multichannel pipette to transfer 2 µl of the diluted bacterial culture from all eight wells
 (rows A–H) onto a prereduced YCFA agar plate (Supplementary Fig. 1). Culture the plate
 anaerobically for 24 h at 37 °C.
 88 The next day, inspect the agar plate and count the bacterial colonies from wells in which the
 colonies can be easily counted with the naked eye. Record the number of colonies as N.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 89 Calculate the bacterial CFU per ml of original culture using the following formula: CFU/ml =
 N × 10(dilution) × 500.
 90 To determine bacterial growth over time, repeat Steps 86–89 during bacterial growth of each strain
 in Step 84 every 2–3 h. Record the OD600 value, and calculate the CFU of 200 µl culture from the
 same bacterial culture at each time point.
 91 Generate a standard curve by plotting the OD600 values and the bacterial concentration (CFU/ml)
 (Supplementary Table 1 contains an example of data we obtained).

 Coculture of monolayer with bacteria
 92 Carefully aspirate the apical medium from each of the wells of the plates from Step 80 using a
 vacuum aspirator and Pasteur pipette tip.
 CRITICAL Tilt the plate toward yourself, and aspirate with the pipette tip pressed against the wall
 c

 of the Transwell insert (avoid placing the Pasteur pipette tip too close to the monolayer).
 CRITICAL We recommend additional TEER measurements and conﬂuency inspection be taken
 c

 immediately prior to coculture with bacteria. To do this, follow Steps 63–80; note that it is not
 necessary to carry out Steps 75–77 as medium is not being changed.
 93 Sterilize the outer surface of the overnight-grown bacterial culture tubes from Step 84 and the
 prereduced YCFA medium with 70% ethanol, and bring them into the biosafety cabinet.
 94 Make a 1:100 dilution of the overnight-grown bacterial culture from Step 93 with prereduced
 YCFA medium. Add 500 µl of the diluted bacteria culture onto the apical side of the
 monolayer, and immediately put the covered monolayer back into the incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C)
 for 2 h.
 CRITICAL It is critical to use medium that is not toxic to the monolayers. Experimentally, we
 c

 found that two commonly used bacterial media, tryptone-yeast extract-glucose (TYG) and brain
 heart infusion, are toxic to the epithelial monolayers. Therefore, a pretest for the toxic effect of the
 bacterial medium on the monolayers is recommended.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 95 After 2 h, remove the plate containing coculture of monolayer and bacteria from the incubator. Use
 a 1,000 µl pipette to transfer the apical medium from each well into a new 24-well tissue culture
 plate, and set aside. Also set aside the Transwell for further use.
 CRITICAL Label the 24-well plate containing the apical medium with the corresponding
 c

 Transwell, as the medium should be transferred back to the original Transwell in Step 97.
 96 Add an appropriate inducer into the apical medium collected in the 24-well tissue culture plate, and
 mix it thoroughly but gently.
 97 Use a 1,000 µl pipette to transfer the inducer-containing apical medium back onto the

 Luminescence data analysis
 103 Calculate the CFU for each sample from Steps 100 and 102 by comparing the OD600 readings
 obtained with the standard curve generated in Step 91 (Supplementary Table 2 contains an example
 of data we have obtained).
 104 Calculate the relative luminescence unit (RLU) by dividing the raw luminescence values obtained
 from the samples prepared in Step 102 by the CFU obtained from Step 102 and standard curve
 from Step 91.
 105 Normalize the RLU value to RPUL by dividing the RLU values of target strain by that of an RPUL
 standard strain. For example, we divide the RLU values B. thetaiotaomicron strain MT798, MT799
 and MT800 by that of the B. thetaiotaomicron strain MT768 (Supplementary Table 2 contains an
 example of these calculations).

 Sample preparation for immunoﬂuorescent imaging

 them with 150 µl and 500 µl of ﬁxative solution (4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde in DPBS−/−)
 into the apical and basolateral sides, respectively. Incubate at room temperature (20 ± 5 °C)
 for 10 min.
 ! CAUTION Formaldehyde is a Group 1 carcinogen classiﬁed by International Agency for Research
 on Cancer. It should be used in a fume hood and disposed of with precaution.

Anticipated results

 Integrity and differentiation of the colon monolayers prior to coculture with bacteria
 In this protocol, we describe how to maintain colon organoids and prepare monolayers from these
 cells. Representative images of organoids during organoid culture (i.e., during Steps 15–34) are shown
 in Fig. 6a. Organoid size and number should increase over time, with the round cyst-like morphology

 maintained throughout. Representative images of the morphology of monolayers over time (i.e.,
 during Steps 62–80) are depicted in Fig. 6b. Images are shown for monolayers at 3, 5 and 7 d after
 seeding, with the increase in the corresponding TEER values over time shown in Fig. 6c and Source
 Data Fig. 6, suggesting that the monolayers are undergoing differentiation. In Fig. 6d, we show typical
 images of proliferative cells (EdU-positive) in a monolayer over time. The increased differentiation is
 accompanied by a decrease in proliferative cells. At day 7, (i.e., 4 d after switching to colon monolayer
 differentiation medium), the proportion of proliferative cells is reduced compared with monolayer at
 day 3 (Fig. 6e and Source Data Fig. 6).
 We observe donor-to-donor variability in monolayer formation. Therefore, we recommend testing
 a few donors for their ability to grow as monolayer in Transwells and remain intact after induction of
 differentiation. Although we have not performed exhaustive testing, we have observed that organoids
 derived from diseased donors are more difﬁcult to expand as organoids in Matrigel and less likely to
 generate stable monolayers in Transwells. In Table 7, we provide guidelines we have found reduce
 donor-to-donor variability. First, it is important to maintain the organoids in an undifferentiated
 state (i.e., as organoids displaying empty lumens and with a thin layer of cells) to increase cell viability
 during single cell dissociation (>85%) and monolayer seeding. Second, it is critical to monitor
 organoid growth in Matrigel to assess organoid growth based on shape, size and overall organoid

 schedule should be adjusted accordingly. Third, it is recommended to prepare more monolayers than
 the minimum required to complete your proposed study to allow for some monolayer failures.
 We typically prepared 30–50% additional Transwells to guarantee sufﬁcient usable monolayers.

 Integrity of monolayers and response of B. thetaiotaomicron to inducers after coculture
 We cocultured colon monolayers with B. thetaiotaomicron MT768, MT798, MT799 and MT80010.
 After 2 h of coculture, bacteria were exposed to four induction conditions: no inducer, aTc, DCA
 and aTc+DCA. Six hours post-induction, the apical medium containing B. thetaiotaomicron was
 harvested to determine the effect of inducers on the bacteria present in the medium. Most bacterial
 cells were located close to the colon epithelium, as shown by the higher optical density and
 luminescence signal for the medium recovered at the bottom of the apical compartment (Supple-
 mentary Table 3). In parallel, the monolayer’s integrity was monitored via TEER measurements.
 Representative bright-ﬁeld images of the monolayers after 8 h of coculture, are shown in Fig. 7a.

 The monolayers appear intact with well-deﬁned cell borders, which was conﬁrmed by the relatively
 high TEER values (Fig. 7b and Source Data Fig. 7), compared with those seen in a bioprinted bilayer
 coculture of primary human intestinal myoﬁbroblasts and the colorectal cancer cell line (Caco-2)
 monolayers30,57. Further evaluation of the monolayers using immunoﬂuorescent staining demon-
 strated well-deﬁned polygonal cell borders between epithelial cells (Fig. 7c) and bacterial cells in
 coculture with epithelial cells (Fig. 7d).
 Quantiﬁcation of the relative bacterial promoter units (RPUL) in the coculture of the three bac-
 terial strains (B. thetaiotaomicron MT798, MT799 and MT800) demonstrated that each strain
 responded to the corresponding inducers (e.g., strain MT798 responded preferentially to the DCA
 inducer, whereas MT800 responded preferentially to aTc). These quantiﬁcation results are similar to
 the bacterial induction previously observed during the validation assay of the circuits (Fig. 7e and
 Supplementary Table 3)10.
