 Heart-forming organoids (HFOs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a complex, highly structured
 in vitro model of early heart, foregut and vasculature development. The model represents a potent tool for various
 applications, including teratogenicity studies, gene function analysis and drug discovery. Here, we provide a detailed
 protocol describing how to form HFOs within 14 d. In an initial 4 d preculture period, hPSC aggregates are individually
 formed in a 96-well format and then Matrigel-embedded. Subsequently, the chemical WNT pathway modulators
 CHIR99021 and IWP2 are applied, inducing directed differentiation. This highly robust protocol can be used on many
 different hPSC lines and be combined with manipulation technologies such as gene targeting and drug testing. HFO
 formation can be assessed by numerous complementary methods, ranging from various imaging approaches to gene
 expression studies. Here, we highlight the ﬂow cytometry-based analysis of individual HFOs, enabling the quantitative
 monitoring of lineage formation.

 Introduction
 Over the last decade, a novel in vitro model has emerged termed ‘organoids’. Organoids are typically
 three-dimensional (3D) cellular clusters that resemble key aspects of native tissues, including their
 cellular composition, morphology and functionality, thereby representing an intermediate between
 conventional 2D or 3D cell cultures and animal models1. Organoids have been generated for a broad
 range of tissues, including the intestine2, kidney3 and brain4, and can be used for various applications
 in basic and translational research1,5. We recently established a novel organoid model termed ‘heart-
 forming organoids’ (HFOs), which resemble early human heart, foregut and vasculature develop-
 ment, and which can, for example, be used for monitoring genetic defects in vitro6. In this protocol,
 we provide additional details of the method we used to facilitate the robust differentiation of HFOs
 from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including embryonic stem cells and induced
 PSCs (iPSCs).
 HFOs consist of a speciﬁc morphological structure, which is schematically depicted in Fig. 1: a
 dense myocardial layer (ML) composed of cardiomyocytes is lined by endocardial-like cells, which
 surround an inner core (IC). The IC comprises anterior foregut endoderm (AFE) tissue and is
 pervaded by vessel-like structures. The ML is covered by a loose outer layer (OL) consisting of
 cardiomyocytes, septum-transversum-like cells and liver progenitors (posterior foregut endoderm,
 PFE), and further enclosed by an outermost layer of mesenchymal cells6. Together, HFOs closely
 resemble patterns of early heart anlagen prior to heart tube formation, which form by an inductive
 exchange with the developing foregut endoderm in the embryo7. As the ﬁrst hPSC-derived model
 mimicking this tissue interplay, HFOs open new perspectives for investigating mechanisms of human
 embryogenesis, disease modeling and drug discovery.

 Development of the protocol
 In general, organoids can be derived from adult stem cells or PSCs. The basic concept of organoid
 formation relies on the stem cells’ capability to self-organize into organ-like tissue patterns upon
 proper stimulation in vitro. Cells are typically exposed to tissue-speciﬁc patterning factors inside a
 hydrogel such as Matrigel, which enables the formation of complex 3D structures1,5. For the for-
 mation of HFOs, we accordingly combined Matrigel encapsulation of hPSC aggregates with an
 established strategy for directed cardiac differentiation based on biphasic WNT pathway modulation

 using the small molecules CHIR99021 (CHIR) and IWP26,8,9. In addition to requiring Matrigel
 encapsulation and WNT pathway modulation, proper induction of the spatiotemporal patterning of
 HFOs required the exact interplay of several deﬁned cues, in particular the aggregate size, culture
 medium volume and process timing combined with a speciﬁc concentration of CHIR. In addition to
 cardiomyogenesis, CHIR treatment has been used to ‘kick-start’ the differentiation of hPSCs into
 multiple other lineages, including deﬁnitive endoderm10, hepatocytes11 and endothelial cells (ECs)12.
 Moreover, previous work has shown that changes in bulk cell density (i.e., the number of hPSCs per
 culture medium volume) in the presence of CHIR can shift the primitive streak-like priming of
 hPSCs, forming either deﬁnitive endoderm or presomitic mesoderm instead of pre-cardiac meso-
 derm. Thus, ‘simple’ WNT pathway induction results in broad developmental potential13,14.

 Comparison with other methods to model heart tissue formation
 A variety of studies on in vitro models of heart tissue formation have been published. However, other
 groups’ work has mainly focused on the engineering of hPSC-derived or primary cardiac cell types,
 including cardiomyocytes, ECs and ﬁbroblasts, into (adult-like) heart tissue models15–21. In contrast
 to the HFO approach, key aspects of native heart development were not mimicked by these studies.
 Models of heart development have been published by Ma et al.22 and Hoang et al.23, who generated
 ‘cardiac microchambers’ by geometric conﬁnement of hPSCs, and by Andersen et al.24, who derived
 ‘precardiac organoids’ from mouse PSCs. Although these models do mimic aspects of cardiogenesis,
 they do not reﬂect the complex spatiotemporal patterns of early heart development, which occurs in
 interplay with foregut endoderm formation. Overcoming this issue, Rossi et al.25 have recently
 described a method for inducing cardiogenesis in gastruloids derived from mouse PSCs. This type of
 organoid comprises cardiac progenitors self-organizing into a heart tube-like domain, which is
 separated from a primitive gut-like tube by an endocardial-like layer. Importantly, however, in
 contrast to any other in vitro model, our hPSC-derived HFOs show the highly organized co-
 development of heart and anterior versus PFE anlagen in combination with endocardium and
 vascular-like network formation. This structure is a result of the exact interplay of several deﬁned
 cues combined with Matrigel encapsulation and WNT pathway modulation as described above, and
 will promote novel mechanistic studies of human organogenesis in vitro.

 Applications of the protocol
 HFOs represent a model system of human heart, foregut and vascular network formation at early
 developmental stages. Given that HFO generation is highly robust and relatively fast and can be
 applied to different hPSC lines, HFOs represent a potent tool to investigate a broad range of basic and
 translational questions. For example, HFOs can be used to study genetic defects in vitro. We have
 demonstrated this by generating NKX2.5 knock-out HFOs, which had malformations of heart
 development similar to those observed in transgenic mice6. The co-differentiation of several cell
 lineages in HFOs, which co-develop in the embryo in a similar way, enables the simultaneous
 monitoring of effects caused by, for example, genetic mutations that differentially impact on the
 distinct lineages. We also anticipate that HFOs could serve as an advanced platform for pharma-
 cological studies, including drug screening as well as teratogenicity and toxicity assays, which should
 help to identify substances and mechanisms causing tissue- and organ-speciﬁc birth defects.

well of an ultra-low attachment 96-U-well plate, followed by centrifugation to form one hPSC aggregate per well (Steps 10–13). On d-2, aggregates are
individually embedded in Matrigel droplets (Steps 14–21) followed by differentiation using the small molecules CHIR99021 and IWP2 (Steps 22–27).
HFO differentiation is completed on d10 (Step 28). Before proceeding with further experiments, HFOs should be assessed under an inverted
microscope (to observe the HFOs from the culture plate bottom) to ensure proper patterning. Analysis of HFOs can be performed by various methods,
including staining and imaging, scRNAseq or ﬂow cytometry (Steps 31–46). t-SNE, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.

 Limitations
 As noted above, HFOs recapitulate well-established patterns of early embryogenesis. However, there
 are distinct differences compared with native heart and foregut development. In contrast to the
 embryo, HFOs do not comprise a continuous, single foregut tube but display two spatially distinct
 anterior versus posterior foregut endoderm compartments. The heart anlage in HFOs is thus located
 between these foregut-like tissues rather than ventrally to the foregut tube as in the embryo. A further
 limitation of the model is the incomplete patterning of the heart anlage, which results in detection of
 second heart ﬁeld-like cells in HFOs only, with an absence of ﬁrst heart ﬁeld-like cell patterns6.
 Moreover, it has to be considered that the modeling capabilities of HFOs are so far limited to very
 early developmental stages only. Later events such as heart tube formation, looping and cardiac
 chamber development are not recapitulated by the current model. Also, the two foregut endoderm
 compartments comprise immature tissue. Further protocol development to further maturation will
 thus be required to advance the model since HFOs seem to degenerate upon long-term cultivation
 under the current culture conditions6.

 Experimental design
 Prior to commencing the protocol, hPSCs must be derived by established monolayer culture8,26.
 HFOs are generated by seeding 5,000 hPSCs per well of an ultra-low attachment 96-U-well plate on
 ‘differentiation day minus 4’ (d-4) followed by centrifugation to form one aggregate per well. After 2 d
 of cultivation (on d-2), these aggregates are individually embedded in Matrigel droplets. Another 2 d
 later (on d0), induction of directed differentiation is initiated by CHIR supplementation until d1
 followed by IWP2 treatment (d3–d5); on d10, HFO differentiation is completed. The HFO differ-
 entiation protocol is schematically outlined in Fig. 2 and explained in detail below. Although no
 special skills or equipment are needed to implement the protocol, it requires practice and attention to

 details. All steps have to be followed precisely to ensure a successful outcome. We therefore
 recommend a couple of practice runs prior to applying the protocol for investigating speciﬁc ques-
 tions. Based on our experience, we anticipate that a person with ~6–12 months of cell culture
 experience should be able to perform the protocol, including successful HFO formation and sub-
 sequent analysis.
 For protocol adaptations such as the use of other cell lines (such as novel reporter, knock-out or
 patient-speciﬁc iPSC lines) or speciﬁc compound treatment (such as growth factors, pharmacological
 compounds, etc.) during differentiation, we recommend the following:
 ● Any new cell line needs to be tested. Although HFOs have been successfully derived from human

 embryonic stem cell and iPSC lines using this protocol without modiﬁcations, it is possible that some
 cell lines may require adaptations concerning, for example, the initial cell number seeded for aggregate
 formation or modulation of the CHIR concentration used to initiate differentiation
 ● Although the protocol is robust, we recommend the induction of more HFOs than actually needed for

 the experiment. This will ensure that enough successfully formed HFO samples and relevant repeats
 will be available to enable the reliable experimental analysis and interpretation. This will also account
 for potential variation or even loss of HFOs due to experimental failure such as mechanical damaging
 of HFOs during the pipetting steps. Only successfully formed, properly patterned HFOs should be used
 for subsequent analyses
 ● It is important that appropriate controls are included within each experiment, such as untreated HFOs

 or HFOs derived from the respective nontargeted wild-type cell line, if applicable. Moreover, before
 drawing conclusions about the potential impact of an experimental treatment on HFO pattern
 formation, robust intra- and interexperimental repeats are required to substantiate novel results
 ●
 HFOs must be fully characterized. Analysis of HFOs can be performed by different methods such as
 whole-mount immunoﬂuorescence (IF) staining and microscopy, histology, gene expression studies
 and ﬂow cytometry of dissociated HFOs, for which we provide a detailed protocol below. However, it
 should be noted that every new analytical method will require establishment and thorough validation
 to comply with the speciﬁc requirements of the different tissues in HFOs, which show differential
 cell–cell adhesion properties, tissue density, etc. Thus, every method has to be critically validated
 regarding its suitability for every cell/tissue type in HFOs and with respect to the respective stage of
 HFO differentiation
