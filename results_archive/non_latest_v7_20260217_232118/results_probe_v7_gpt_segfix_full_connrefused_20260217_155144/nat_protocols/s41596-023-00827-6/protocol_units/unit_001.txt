 Organoids have been an exciting advancement in stem cell research. Here we describe a strategy for directed
 differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into distal lung organoids. This protocol recapitulates lung development by
 sequentially specifying human pluripotent stem cells to deﬁnitive endoderm, anterior foregut endoderm, ventral anterior
 foregut endoderm, lung bud organoids and ﬁnally lung organoids. The organoids take ~40 d to generate and can be
 maintained more than 180 d, while progressively maturing up to a stage consistent with the second trimester of human
 gestation. They are unique because of their branching morphology, the near absence of non-lung endodermal lineages,

 presence of mesenchyme and capacity to recapitulate interstitial lung diseases. This protocol can be performed by anyone
 familiar with cell culture techniques, is conducted in serum-free conditions and does not require lineage-speciﬁc reporters
 or enrichment steps. We also provide a protocol for the generation of single-cell suspensions for single-cell RNA
 sequencing.

 Introduction
 Organoids are used to study human development and to model disease1,2. Among others, major
 progress has been made in the generation of lung organoids3,4. The lung epithelium contains multiple
 cell types, including basal, ciliated, secretory, goblet and neuroendocrine cells in the airways, and
 alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) and surfactant-producing alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells in the
 alveoli, where gas exchange takes place4,5. In addition, several novel transitional cell populations have
 been identiﬁed in the human distal lung respiratory airway or terminal respiratory bronchioles, very
 small airways in which alveoli empty and that contain more extensive alveoli at their distal tips6–8.
 The respiratory system originates from buds that arise on the ventral aspect of the anterior foregut
 endoderm (AFE) during embryonic stage (E9.5–E12.5 in the mouse, 4–7 post-conception weeks
 (pcw) in humans). These undergo a stereotyped branching process during the pseudoglandular stage
 (E12.5–E16.5 in the mouse, 5–17 pcw in humans). During the canalicular stage (E16.5–E17.5 in the
 mouse, 16–26 pcw in humans) cell cycle activity decreases and specialization of the airway epithelium
 occurs in the stalks, with the emergence of basal, goblet, club, ciliated and other cell types. This stage
 is followed by the saccular stage, where the canaliculi widen into sacculations that will give rise to
 primitive alveoli (E17.5 to birth in the mouse, 26–38 pcw in humans)5,9–11. Expansion of alveolar
 number by further differentiation of immature saccules, alveolar maturation and secondary septation
 continue predominantly postnatally (alveolar stage, postnatal days 0–21 (d0–21) in mice, 38 pcw to
 the age of 21 years in humans)11,12. Generating organoids that at least partially model human lung
 development requires recapitulating this process to the extent possible in vitro.

 Since the ﬁrst reports on their establishment from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)13,14,
 several publications showed the generation of lung organoids, either from fetal or adult lung15–18 or
 from hPSCs19–26. We developed a directed differentiation strategy of hPSCs (both embryonic stem
 cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)) into three-dimensional (3D) lung organoids
 that undergo a process similar to branching morphogenesis and that we have used to model ﬁbrotic
 interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) and viral infection20,27,28.
 This protocol (Fig. 1a) begins by replicating early lung development through successive speciﬁ-
 cation of deﬁnitive endoderm (DE) and AFE according to protocols we established previously
 (Fig. 1b, i–iii, d4.3, d6.3)20,29,30. Subsequently, small organoids that are endowed with the expression
 patterns associated with lung buds in vivo (hence the name ‘lung bud organoids’ or LBOs, Fig. 1b,
 iv–vi, d8, d9, d15) are generated in suspension culture20. These LBOs can give rise to lung and airway
 structures after transplantation under the kidney capsule of immunodeﬁcient mice or can be
 embedded in Matrigel20, where a process similar to branching morphogenesis ensues and organoids
 arise that expand more than 6 months (Fig. 1b, vii, viii, d42, d70). Genome-wide expression analysis
 and benchmarking against the Keygenes database31, which contains tissues from the ﬁrst and second
 trimester of human gestation and of adult humans, revealed that organoids at d170 corresponded best
 to lung in the second trimester of human gestation20. At these later stages of the cultures, AT2 cells
 arise at the tips. These contain lamellar bodies (LBs) by transmission electron microscopy and can
 take up and secrete ﬂuorescently labeled surfactant protein B (SFTPB)20, features speciﬁc to AT2 cells.
 Mesenchyme appears during the anteriorization and ventralization stages and becomes scarce after
 development in Matrigel20. This may correspond to the attrition of mesenchyme during lung
 development32.

 Applications of the method
 The most unique feature of the organoids described here is the presence of mesenchyme that allows
 studies of epithelial–mesenchymal interactions and therefore recapitulation and modeling of at least
 some ILDs. ILDs are a heterogeneous group of entities with diverse or unknown etiologies affecting
 the lung interstitium33. Development of pulmonary ﬁbrosis (PF), most commonly associated with
 idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis (IPF), portends the worst prognosis33,34. Injury to AT2 cells probably
 plays a critical role in the development of both familial and sporadic IPF, as mutations causing
 familial IPF speciﬁcally affect AT2 function, while depletion of AT2 cells in mouse models is asso-
 ciated with ﬁbrosis35. In addition, a fraction of patients with familial IPF have heterozygous muta-
 tions in telomerase components or other genes involved in telomere maintenance36–43. Furthermore,
 several susceptibility loci have been identiﬁed that affect telomere length44. As telomeropathy affects
 stem cell function and AT2 cells are facultative distal lung stem cells4,45, these associations suggest a
 role for AT2 cells.
 Finding therapeutic targets and novel drug treatments requires models to dissect pathogenetic
 mechanisms, identify biomarkers, discover drug targets and perform drug testing. It has been chal-
 lenging to model ILDs in animal models34,35,46–48. A complementary, more malleable, but also more
 reductionist avenue are lung organoids derived from hPSCs. We showed that PF caused by mutation
 in Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome (HPS) genes could be modeled28. HPS is a genetic syndrome caused
 by abnormal biogenesis and trafﬁcking of lysosome-related organelles and characterized by hypo-
 pigmentation, bleeding diathesis and in some but not all genotypes, PF, also known as HPS-associated
 interstitial pneumonia (HPSIP). Fibrosis in HPSIP is most probably linked to the fact that home-
 ostasis of LBs in AT2 cells is abnormal and surfactant secretion is reduced, as LBs are also lysosome-
 related organelles49. Of the nine genotypes, only three (HPS1, 2 and 4) are clinically associated with
 HPSIP. Accordingly, we found that only organoids derived from ESCs with mutation in HPS1, 2 or
 4 showed ﬁbrotic changes, whereas organoids with a mutation in HPS8, which is clinically not
 associated with ﬁbrosis, did not28. This model therefore recapitulates the clinical incidence of PF in
 HPS. By comparing genome-wide expression data from epithelial cells isolated from lung organoids
 generated from the ﬁbrosis prone (HPS1−/− and HPS2−/−) and non-ﬁbrosis-prone (HPS8−/−)
 mutants, we furthermore identiﬁed interleukin-11 as a therapeutic target critical to ﬁbrosis. This
 provides proof-of-principle evidence that pathogenetic mechanism and therapeutic targets can be
 identiﬁed using lung organoids with mutations associated with diseases28.
 The organoids can also be used to model viral infection. They can be infected by respiratory
 viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainﬂuenza and measles. We showed that the organoids
 are authentic infection models that do not promote the emergence of culture-adapted variants in the
 propagation of parainﬂuenza27. In the case of respiratory syncytial virus, we could show that infected
 epithelial cells are dislodged into the lumen, as is observed in bronchiolitis caused by this virus49.
 The organoids can also be used for modeling human lung development. As an example, single-cell
 RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and confocal analysis is presented in the ‘Anticipated results’ section,
 showing progressive loss of other endodermal fates present early in organoid development, and
 reciprocal acquisition of a distal lung fate. This model can therefore be used to examine relevant
 signaling pathways as well as transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the progressive speciﬁcation
 of distal lung. The fact that undifferentiated endoderm remains present in organoids early in
 development suggests that it is possible that by changing the culture conditions, other endodermal
 fates could be obtained, which may constitute another potential application of this model. The
 spontaneous formation of branching structures also suggest that this model could be used to study
 branching morphogenesis in the lung.

 Comparison with other methods
 Since the ﬁrst reports on their establishment from hPSCs13,14, several publications showed the
 generation of lung organoids, either from fetal or adult lung15–18 or from hPSCs19–26. In many cases,
 the structures are limited in size or contain, often by design, speciﬁc cell types (airway23,26,50 or AT2
 cells19,24,51). The lung organoids described here present several unique features compared with others
 as a model of human distal lung development.

 Branching morphogenesis
 A ﬁrst feature is that they undergo a process similar to branching morphogenesis and that the full
 potential to generate lung and airways is present in the early organoids. While differentiation is biased

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 toward distal lung in the conditions we use in vitro (described here in this protocol), the early-stage
 lung organoids (LBOs in suspension) generate structures containing branching tubules with prox-
 imodistal speciﬁcation when embedded in donor-derived mesenchyme after transplantation under the
 kidney capsule of immunodeﬁcient mice20. Another group (the protocol described in Miller et al.22)
 also reported generation of 3D human lung organoids from hPSCs13,14. While these smaller structures
 contained cells expressing markers of lung and airway14 and have some airway potential after sub-
 cutaneous xenografting in mice13, they did not show branching structures. However, these organoids
 were similar to our reported organoids, staged as early fetal lung22.

 Pulmonary mesenchyme
 Another notable feature of the distal lung organoids described here is the presence of mesenchyme,
 the origin of which is unclear. Mesenchyme could already be detected during the AFE stage of the
 protocol, remains present and relatively abundant during the LBO (suspension) stage, and becomes
 scarce, but still detectable after development to at least d60 in Matrigel20. The mesenchymal cells can
 be isolated by cell sorting for EPCAM−THY+ cells28. RNAseq20 as well as scRNAseq (see ‘Anticipated
 results’) showed that this mesenchyme expresses genes associated with pulmonary mesenchyme
 (including WTN2B52 and TBX4 (ref. 53)). The presence of mesenchyme is shared with the protocol
 of Miller et al., although they did not further characterize the mesenchyme22. The presence of
 mesenchyme in our organoids may explain what is probably the most unique application of these
 organoids, the capacity to recapitulate at least one ILDs: HPSIP. Together, these ﬁndings indicate that
 these distal lung organoids can represent an integrated model of distal lung development and disease.

 Differentiation efﬁciency
 A ﬁnal distinguishing feature of the organoids described here is that any intervening puriﬁcation steps
 are unnecessary. The in vitro generation of NKX2.1+ lung progenitors with high efﬁciency is a critical
 but challenging step. To resolve this issue, several groups have developed strategies based on lineage-
 speciﬁc reporters to isolate these before further differentiation and maturation. In two reports from
 the same laboratory, McCauley et al.54 speciﬁed lung progenitors, and isolated NKX2.1GFP+ cells at
 d15 for further culture in Matrigel 3D medium to yield proximal airway spheroids devoid of distal
 potential, while Jacob et al.19 resorted to a NKX2.1GFPSFTPCtdTomato reporter cell line to isolate
 NKX2.1GFP+SFTPCtdTomato+ cells for further culture in Matrigel to generate spheroids containing
 AT2 cells. While these protocols are advantageous when differentiation efﬁciency is modest, they only
 allow for studies using these speciﬁc reporter lines. To resolve this problem, surface markers were
 identiﬁed by which NKX2.1+ lung progenitors can be isolated from the cultures. Gotoh et al. reported
 carboxypeptidase M (CPM) as a speciﬁc marker of NKX2.1+ progenitors24, which was then used by
 Konishi et al.26 to select for NKX2.1+ cells. Hawkins et al. used differential expression of CD47 and
 CD26 to show that CD47hiCD26lo cells are enriched in NKX2.1+ lung progenitors55. However, a
 rigorous head-to-head comparison with reporter lines has not been performed.
 The reasons why neither reporter cells nor cell sorting are required in our protocol are unclear. We
 speculate that some differences in our protocol may offer an explanation. We grow hPSCs in the
 presence of feeders, as we have found that passage in feeder-free conditions compromises future lung
 potential. Second, although commercial kits to generate DE have been recommended and are widely
 used56, we found that, while DE generation was indeed efﬁcient, the lung potential of the DE
 generated was suboptimal. We therefore adhere to a strict protocol to generate DE using reagents that
 have to be lot tested. We also generate DE in 3D embryoid bodies, and not in two-dimensional (2D)
 cultures. Finally, the LBO suspension culture step may select for cells speciﬁed to pulmonary epi-
 thelium and mesenchyme. The same may be true for the Matrigel step. Indeed, scRNAseq analysis
 suggests progressive acquisition of a distal lung at the expense of other endodermal fates over the ﬁrst
 80 d of the protocol (see ‘Anticipated results’).

 A serum-free model
 The published protocol that is the most closely related to the protocol described here was by Miller et al.22.
 However, the factors used in the latter differ from ours. In the speciﬁcation of AFE they also use, in
 addition to BMP and TGF-β inhibition, Wnt agonism, FGF4 and Smoothened agonist. They do not
 include an extended period of suspension culture (which in the protocol described here generates
 LBOs). Furthermore, and importantly, they use fetal bovine serum (FBS) in their base medium, which
 we try to avoid as this is an uncharacterized reagent. Miller et al. do obtain proximal and some distal
 lung speciﬁcation in the presence of serum, and in conditions similar to ours (but without BMP4 and

 FGF10) they obtain small spherical ‘bud tip’ organoids. The organoids we describe here do not
 develop in the presence of serum (Fig. 2).

 Development and disease modeling
 As mentioned before, the organoids of Miller et al. are much smaller and do not show branching.
 Commonalities between both types of organoids are the capacity to generate lung and airway
 structures after transplantation under the kidney capsule of immunodeﬁcient mice, the presence of
 mesenchyme and the fact that repeated enrichment steps are not required. In contrast to the current
 protocol, that of Miller et al. has not been reported to be useful in modeling ILDs, and was not
 reported to be infectable by the viruses we used20,27. Both models will probably serve complementary
 goals. The capacity to generate airway cells in the protocol of Miller et al., for example, may allow
 studies on airway development and proximodistal speciﬁcation, whereas the organoids reported here
 will allow investigation of branching morphogenesis and alveolar speciﬁcation, in addition to
 modeling ILDs.
 We have also previously reported on a protocol in Collagen I (Col I) gels that allows further
 maturation of lung cells in 3D21,57. This Col I protocol and the resulting organoids are distinct
 from the protocol described here. Rather than generating 3D LBOs in suspension culture, the Col I
 protocol continues lung progenitor speciﬁcation in 2D, followed by plating into Col I gels. The
 Col I model is, in contrast to the organoids described here, permissive for the speciﬁcation of all distal
 and airway lineages after retraction of CHIR99021 (CHIR), including cells compatible with AT1 cells.
 This ﬁnding is consistent with the observations of Kanagaki et al. in ﬁbroblast-dependent alveolar
 organoids58. However, retraction of CHIR in the distal lung organoids described here results in cell
 death and disintegration. In vitro, we were therefore not able to achieve induction of AT1 markers in
 lung organoids generated using the protocol described here. However, we do note that after trans-
 plantation under the kidney capsule, LBOs could generate cells expressing AT1 markers20, suggesting
 that the potential exists, but that the correct in vitro conditions for AT1 generation have not yet been
 identiﬁed for these organoids.
 In addition, while in most studies the maturity of the generated cells goes unreported or is
 equivalent to the second trimester of human gestation21, the cells generated by our Col I protocol
 exhibit transcriptomic proﬁles, ultrastructure and an array of lineage-speciﬁc markers that also
 partially match postnatal lungs21. Several mature cell types can be isolated using surface markers.
 Most notably, the Col I protocol allowed the generation NGFR+ basal cells, the stem cells of the
 postnatal airway59, which can be isolated and further expanded using established techniques60. On
 the other hand, and in contrast to the model described here, modeling ﬁbrotic lung disease was not
 possible, and mesenchymal cells were not present. Both models are therefore complementary. The
 reason why both protocols behave differently is most likely linked to differences in the early stages of
 directed differentiation and the different extracellular matrices used to embed the organoids. The
 underlying mechanisms merit further investigation.

 Limitations
 Even after 6 months of culture in Matrigel, the organoid model matches the second trimester of
 human gestation on the basis of genome-wide expression analysis. The expression of SFTPC, a
 marker of mature AT2 cells occurs late in the culture (d170) and is not universal (Fig. 3a), although
 all other AT2 markers studied (SFTPB, ABCA3, LPCAT, NAPSA, SLC34A2) reproducibly and pro-
 gressively increase and are consistently expressed by a majority of the cells by d80 (see ‘Anticipated
 results’). We have previously shown the presence of LBs and capacity to take up and release SFTPB in
 organoids >d120 old, indicating long-term maintenance of still immature AT2 cells20. The

 combination of CHIR, FGF7 and dexamethasone, cAMP and IBMX has been reported to be necessary
 for the expansion and maintenance of so-called alveolospheres generated from hPSC-derived lung
 progenitors. Even here, however, maintaining SFTPC expression was challenging and required
 repeated sorting for a reporter, as well switching the culture conditions between presence and absence
 of CHIR19,56. We also note that in the organoid protocol of Miller et al.22, SFTPC expression was rare.
 Even though we observed a process reminiscent of branching morphogenesis, the branching is not
 well organized. The structures branch randomly in every direction and appeared disorganized,
 probably because neither directional cues nor physical constraints, such as a thoracic cavity, are
 provided. In addition, the exact nature and patterning of the mesenchyme present is unclear and the
 proportion declines along the culture time. The mesenchyme does not have the potential to generate
 endothelial cells in vivo after transplantation under the kidney capsule, although smooth muscle and
 occasional cartilage were present20. Endothelial cells or blood vessels have also not been observed
 in vitro in our model. Furthermore, we could not achieve induction of AT1 markers in vitro, although
 AT1 markers were observed after engraftment in vivo20. Terminal and architecturally fully appro-
 priate maturation of organoids is still a challenge for the ﬁeld in general. Finally, the use of Matrigel to
 embed LBOs and serum to inactive enzymatic activities in this model is still a barrier for translational
 research. The use of Matrigel might be replaced with synthetic hydrogels. However, when LBOs,
 generated using the protocol described here, were embedded in Col I gels, they did not show
 branching (Fig. 4). We do not know whether this is due to the molecular composition or the stiffness
 of Matrigel that allows branching morphogenesis of LBOs. Hence, the choice of 3D medium for
 embedding should take these two factors into consideration. The use of serum to inactivate enzymes
 in the protocol can be easily substituted with puriﬁed protease inhibitors.

 Experimental design
 A schematic of the protocol with examples of the typical morphologies at each stage is shown in Fig. 1.
 We maintain hPSCs on feeder cells. The protocol begins with mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast (MEF)
 depletion (d1, Fig. 1b, i) followed by a stepwise, sequential induction of DE (d0–4, Fig. 1b, ii) and AFE
 (d5–6, Fig. 1b, iii) as previously described20,61. hPSCs are passaged on Matrigel-coated plates to
 deplete residual MEFs for ~24 h (Steps 1–13). After MEF depletion, primitive streak and embryoid
 body induction is performed in embryoid bodies/primitive streak (EB/PS) medium in ultralow-
 attachment plates for 12–16 h (Steps 14–27). This is followed by switching to DE induction medium
 for another 76–80 h (d4; Steps 28–42). Essential in this step is exposure to high concentrations of
 Activin A. DE can be generated both in 2D adherent cultures and or in 3D as EBs in low-attachment
 plates. We found that lung potential is maintained the best in EBs. DE purity is veriﬁed by ﬂow
 cytometry after staining for EPCAM, cKIT and CXCR4 (Steps 43–66)20,61. It is essential that more
 than 90% of the cells express high levels of these three markers. Others have recommended the use of
 commercial kits to generate DE56. We found that while generation of DE was efﬁcient, the potential
 of these DE cells to generate lung and airway cells was more limited.
 High-purity DE (>90%) is directed to AFE via inhibition of TGF-β, BMP and WNT signaling by
 SB 431542, NOGGIN and IWP2, respectively (Steps 67–89)29,30,61. At the end of AFE induction (d6),
 cells are treated with ventralization medium in the presence of BMP4, FGF10, FGF7, all-trans retinoic
 acid (RA) and the glycogen synthase kinase 3β antagonist, CHIR for 48 h (Steps 90–92). At this time,
 formation of loosely adherent clumps can be observed (Fig. 1b, iv). Next, LBOs are generated
 (Steps 93–99). This is accomplished by resuspending clumps of cells at d8 and maintaining those in
 ultra-low-attachment plates in the presence of CHIR, FGF10, FGF7, BMP4 and RA, where they will
 form spheres consisting of folding epithelial sheets interspersed with mesenchymal cells (Fig. 1b, v, vi
 and Fig. 3b). The majority of the epithelial cells will express early, but not mature lung markers, and
 have an expression proﬁle consistent with lung bud epithelium. The mesenchymal cells express
 markers consistent with pulmonary mesenchyme, and can make up 5–20% of the population by ﬂow
 cytometry20.
 In the ﬁnal stage (Steps 100–117), the LBOs are plated in Matrigel with CHIR, FGF10, FGF7,
 BMP4 and RA, where they undergo outward budding followed by a process similar to branching
 morphogenesis (Fig. 1b, vii, viii). Other alternatives can be used, such as Cultrex (R&D Systems),
