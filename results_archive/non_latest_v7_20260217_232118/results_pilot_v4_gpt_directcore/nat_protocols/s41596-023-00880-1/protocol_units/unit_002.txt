Differentiation of iPSCs to metanephric mesenchyme and PT-enhanced organoid generation
Amongst other differences, the monolayer differentiation stage of this protocol has been prolonged compared with our previous methodology9,10, with organoid generation occurring at day 13 (Step 31), and utilises both TeSR-E6 and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium/Nutrient Mixture F12 (DMEM/F12) basal medium. Differentiation is commenced 24 h post-seeding by exposing the iPSCs to TeSR-E6 containing 6 µM CHIR99021 followed by 200 ng/mL FGF9 for 5 and 2 d, respectively, inducing posterior intermediate mesoderm and metanephric mesenchyme (Steps 25–28).
