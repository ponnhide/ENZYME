60. Prepare three 15 mL conical tubes for the ‘substrate’ (with DAPI), ‘inhibitor’ (cimetidine) and ‘substrate + inhibitor’ (DAPI + cimetidine) conditions, each containing 4 mL of E6 medium and 4 µL of DRAQ7 dead cell stain (1:1,000 dilution).
61. Add 4 µL of DAPI to ‘substrate’ and ‘substrate + inhibitor’ tubes containing 4 mL of E6 (1:1,000 dilution). Mix well.
62. Add 4 μL of 100 mM cimetidine to ‘inhibitor’ and ‘substrate + inhibitor’ tubes containing 4 mL of E6 (1:1,000 dilution, final concentration 100 µM). Mix well.
63. Remove a Transwell plate with six wells of day 27 PT‑enhanced organoids from the incubator. Label three wells ‘test’ and three wells ‘control’.
64. Aspirate culture medium from the three control wells and replace this medium with the ‘inhibitor’ medium, first adding a drop on top of each organoid then dispensing the remaining 1 mL to the basolateral compartment of each Transwell.
65. Incubate the organoids for 30 min in a 37 °C incubator.
66. Following incubation, aspirate the inhibitor medium from the control wells, as well as the E6 culture medium from the three test wells.
67. Add ‘substrate’ medium to the three test wells and ‘substrate + inhibitor’ medium to the three control wells, first adding a drop on top of each organoid, then dispensing the remaining 1 mL to the basolateral compartment of each Transwell.
68. Incubate the organoids for 1 h in a 37 °C incubator.
69. Following incubation, aspirate the medium from test and control wells then wash once quickly (less than 5 min) with HBSS, first adding a drop to the top of each organoid then dispensing the remaining 1 mL to the basolateral compartment of each Transwell.
70. Transfer the Transwell inserts to a glass‑bottomed six‑well imaging plate containing 1 mL of HBSS in the base of each well.
71. Image immediately using a confocal microscope with 405 and 640 nm lasers and a 10–20× Plan Apochromatic long working distance objective to distinguish DAPI‑ and
