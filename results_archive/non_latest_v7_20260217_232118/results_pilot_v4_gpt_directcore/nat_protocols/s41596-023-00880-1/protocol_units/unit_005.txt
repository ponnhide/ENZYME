52. Day 27: prepare two 15 mL conical tubes for the ‘test’ (with albumin) and ‘control’ (without albumin) conditions, each containing 4 mL of E6 medium.
53. Add 4 µL of TRITC–albumin to 4 mL of E6 within ‘test’ conical tube (1:1,000 dilution).
54. Remove a Transwell plate with six wells of day 27 PT‑enhanced organoids from the incubator. Label three wells ‘test’ and three wells ‘control’.
55. Aspirate culture medium from wells then add TRITC–albumin to ‘test’ wells and plain E6 to ‘control’ wells, first adding a drop on top of each organoid, then dispensing the remaining 1 mL to the basolateral compartment of each Transwell.
56. Incubate the organoids overnight (~16–20 h) in a 37 °C incubator.
57. Day 28: wash the organoids three times in HBSS (5 min per wash) by placing a drop of HBSS on top of the organoid and the remaining 1 mL in the basolateral compartment of each Transwell.
58. After the final wash, transfer the Transwell inserts to a glass‑bottomed six‑well imaging plate containing 1 mL of HBSS in the base of each well.
59. Image immediately using a confocal microscope with a 594 nm laser and a 10–20× Plan Apochromatic long working distance objective to distinguish TRITC–albumin, simultaneously capturing transmitted light to localise the TRITC–albumin within the nephrons of PT‑enhanced organoids.
