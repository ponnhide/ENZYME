Laminin‑521‑coated 12‑well tissue culture plate for differentiation
For each well of a 12‑well plate required, add 20 µL of Laminin‑521 to 1 mL of cold DMEM/F12. Pipette to mix and dispense 1 mL per well. Seal the plate with parafilm and store overnight at 4 °C for optimal coating. Warm to 37 °C in a CO2 incubator before dissociating and seeding of hPSCs (Steps 10–24).
