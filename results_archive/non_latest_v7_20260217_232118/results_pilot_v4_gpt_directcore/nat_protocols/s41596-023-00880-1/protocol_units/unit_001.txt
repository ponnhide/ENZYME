Seeding and attachment of hPSCs for differentiation
Accurate and consistent seeding density are important to differentiation outcome and reproducibility of the PT-enhanced organoid protocol. The iPSCs are consistently seeded for differentiation onto Laminin-coated 12-well plates 2 d post-passaging, at which time the iPSC culture has reached ~80% confluency, at a density of 25,000 cells per well (Steps 10–24). The number of wells is calculated at Step 10 to ensure adequate organoids for control and test conditions in downstream analyses (Steps 54–91), including functional assays (PT-specific uptake of fluorescently labeled substrates) and immunofluorescence.
