For dose‑dependent light sensitivity, expose each organoid to 500 ms long flashes. Start with a low intensity of 2,000 mlux (moonlight on a clear night), increase to 20,000 mlux (candle light) and then to 200,000 mlux (daylight on a cloudy day). Repeat each intensity three times at 3 min intervals, and then switch to the next higher light intensity.
