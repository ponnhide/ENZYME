3 Transfer the mixture into a Zymo-Spin IC Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30 s at 16,000g. Transfer the column into a new collection tube and discard the ﬂow through.
4 In an RNase‑free tube, add 5 μl DNase I (6 U/μl), 35 μl DNA Digestion Buffer and mix by gentle inversion. Add the mix directly to the column matrix. Incubate at room temperature (20–30 °C) for 15 min.
