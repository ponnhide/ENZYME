11 For RT–qPCR, prepare technical triplicates of 15 μl reaction:

Component Volume for 15 μl reaction

Sybr green 7.5 μl
Forward primer (from 0.15 μl 10 μM stock)
Reverse primer (from 0.15 μl 10 μM stock)
cDNA Variable
Water Variable
Total volume 15 μl

12 Prepare samples in a 384‑well plate and run for 40 cycles. Use primers listed in Table 1. Calculate relative gene expression on the basis of the average cycle (Ct) value, normalized to GAPDH as the internal control and reported as fold change (2(-ddCT)).
