Single-cell dissociation ● Timing ~90 min
11 Make up a dissociation solution of fresh 0.5 mg/ml dispase II, 0.2 mg/ml collagenase IV and 0.2 mg/ml DNase I in PBS at room temperature.
12 Remove PBS from the wells by pipetting and add the dissociation solution.
13 Scrape Matrigel droplets and pool all cells from all conditions with dissociation solution to a gentleMACS C‑Tube. Top up the dissociation solution to 5 ml/C‑Tube.
14 Dissociate organoids into single cells by using a gentleMACS Octo dissociator and the ‘Standard protocol’ (see Equipment setup) (Timing: ~50 min).
