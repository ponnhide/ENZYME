34 Resuspend the pellet in an appropriate amount of BME. As a guideline, 200 µl is sufﬁcient for a pellet of ~50 µl. The amount of BME to add scales linearly with the pellet volume. 35 Plate 100 µl of BME‑containing cells in multiple small drops (<20 µl each) per well in a 12‑well plate (Fig. 2e). When tissue yield is limited, plating can be scaled down to 24‑well format by adapting all volumes accordingly (Table 3).
