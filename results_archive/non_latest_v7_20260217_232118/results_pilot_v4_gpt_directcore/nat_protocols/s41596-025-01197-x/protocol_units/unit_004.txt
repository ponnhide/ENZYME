Isolated SNRs are cultured in suspension on an orbital shaker at 45 rpm with the amplification medium containing EGF (10 ng/mL) and FGF2 (10 ng/mL). We use a multichannel pipettor for half medium changes every other day. The fresh medium contains 2× EGF (20 ng/mL) and 2× FGF2 (20 ng/mL) to maintain the final concentrations of these growth factors at 10 ng/mL.
