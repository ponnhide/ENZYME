(i) Fixation: transfer organoids to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube using a P200 pipette tip cut to avoid damaging the organoids. (ii) Let organoids settle to the bottom, aspirate the medium, and rinse once with sterile PBS. (iii) Discard the supernatant, add 250 μL of 4 % PFA and incubate overnight at 4 °C. (iv) Sucrose gradient: sequentially add and remove 1 mL of 10 %, 20 % and 30 % sucrose solutions, allowing organoids to settle to the bottom between each step (30–40 min per step). (v) OCT embedding: transfer organoids to a cryosection mold, remove residual sucrose solution and slowly fill the mold with OCT, avoiding bubbles. (vi) Flash freeze the mold containing OCT and organoids by placing it on dry ice. (vii) Cryosectioning: use a cryostat to cut 15–20‑μm‑thick sections and place them onto positively charged microscope slides. (viii) Immunohistochemistry: block the sections with 3 % BSA and 0.3 % Triton‑X 100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, incubate overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, wash, incubate with secondary antibodies for 1–2 h at room temperature, wash, mount coverslips, and air‑dry.
