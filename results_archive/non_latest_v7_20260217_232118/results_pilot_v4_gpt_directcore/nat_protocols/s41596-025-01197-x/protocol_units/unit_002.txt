The successfully induced cultures are replated using Dispase, which allows the detachment of neuroectodermal cell clusters. The clusters of neuroectodermal cells give rise to NRs. Upon replating, we switch to the amplification medium with EGF (10 ng/mL) and FGF2 (10 ng/mL). Half the medium is exchanged every other day with fresh medium containing 2× EGF (20 ng/mL) and 2× FGF2 (20 ng/mL) to maintain the final concentration at 10 ng/mL. We limit FGF2 exposure to 5 d (two medium changes) to avoid potential tissue caudalization50. We continue including EGF until NRs become apparent. We use glass Pasteur pipettes bent
