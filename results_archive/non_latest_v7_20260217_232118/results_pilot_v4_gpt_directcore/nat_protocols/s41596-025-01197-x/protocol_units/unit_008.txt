(i) Organoid preparation and mounting: transfer a 5‑month‑old organoid to a 6 cm dish with ice‑cold, oxygenated cutting ACSF using a P1000 pipette tip cut to avoid damaging the organoid. (ii) Prepare the vibratome by wiping the vibratome chamber with Kimwipes and coating the post with a thin layer of superglue. (iii) Mount the organoid on the glue‑coated post using a plastic spatula. (iv) Fill the vibratome chamber with ice‑cold, oxygenated cutting ACSF and bubble with carbogen. (v) Cut 350‑µm‑thick slices using the vibratome set to 100 Hz frequency, 1.2 mm amplitude and a slow forward movement velocity. (vi) Transfer slices to a maintenance beaker with bubbling ACSF, then to a recording chamber. (vii) Patch‑clamp: use a thin‑walled borosilicate glass pipette (5–8 MΩ) filled with standard intracellular solution, approach a visually identified neuron, form a Giga seal, rupture the membrane, and record in current‑clamp mode.
