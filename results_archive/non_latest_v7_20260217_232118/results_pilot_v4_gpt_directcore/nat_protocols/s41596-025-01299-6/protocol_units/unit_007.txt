30. Pool 12 organoids into one well of a six-well plate along with 3 ml of enzyme solution with papain (10 U ml−1). Incubate the plate with organoids at 37 °C for 15 min in a 5% CO2 incubator. Gently shake the plate horizontally every 5 min to evenly distribute the papain solution. Both control and genetically perturbed hSO should be dissociated at this step, because control (uninfected) cells will be needed to set the gate for FACS.
