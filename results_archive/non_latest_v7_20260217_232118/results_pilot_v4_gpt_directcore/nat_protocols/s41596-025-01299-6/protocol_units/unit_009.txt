44. Transfer one hFA into a 10-cm dish. Aspirate the medium as much as possible.
45. Align the assembloid with the hCO on the left and the hSO on the right (Fig. 3i). Use a fluorescence microscope to confirm the identity of the hSO by checking the hFA, as the hSO should show many Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells.
46. Carefully separate the two organoids at the boundary of the fusion with tweezers or scissors.
47. Collect the hCO and hSO into separate dishes with NM. Save the samples in the incubator until the next step.
48. Repeat this process for the rest of the hFA.
49. Pool eight organoids per well and then proceed with dissociation. A few control hSO (uninfected) should be dissociated at this step to be used as a negative control for FACS.
