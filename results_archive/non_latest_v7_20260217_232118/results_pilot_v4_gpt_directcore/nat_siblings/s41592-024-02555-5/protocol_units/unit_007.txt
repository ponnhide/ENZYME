we assessed the demultiplexing performance of the different algorithms, we pooled PSC lines (5,000 cells per line) before organoid generation we benchmarked them with ground truth priors using (1) five in silico multiplexed datasets with varying degree of balance among genotypes and (2) two ad hoc experiments in which the different genotypes were barcode-tagged before pooling
