Screen results were analysed using the casTLE software54, a maximum likelihood estimator that provides for each gene: a casTLE score, a log‑likelihood ratio that considers the relative enrichment or depletion of each gene‑targeting sgRNA compared to the distribution of negative control sgRNA effects, a casTLE effect size, a log2‑transformed maximum likelihood estimate of the ratio of cells containing sgRNAs targeting a given gene in one sample compared to another, normalized to the median difference of negative control sgRNAs.
