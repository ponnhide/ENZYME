From day 6 to 24, neural medium was supplemented with 20 ng ml−1 EGF (R&D Systems) and 20 ng ml−1 FGF2 (R&D Systems) with daily medium change in the first 10 days, and the lentivirally integrated sgRNA spacer sequence using the Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase (Agilent, catalogue no. 600679). From day 25 to day 43, neural medium was supplemented with 20 ng ml−1 brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (Peprotech, catalogue no. 450-02) and 20 ng ml−1 NT‑3 (Peprotech, catalogue no. 450-03). From day 44, only neural medium without growth factors was used for medium changes every 4 days.
