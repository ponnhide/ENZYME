To generate 3D hCO, hiPS cells were dissociated with accutase to obtain a single-cell suspension. About 3 × 10^6 cells per AggreWell 800 plate well in Essential 8 medium supplemented with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (10 µM). The plate was centrifuged at 100 g for 3 min and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2.
