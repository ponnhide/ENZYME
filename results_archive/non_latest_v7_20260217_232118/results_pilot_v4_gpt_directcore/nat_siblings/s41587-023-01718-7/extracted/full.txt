 The epicardium, the mesothelial envelope of the vertebrate heart, is the
 source of multiple cardiac cell lineages during embryonic development and
 provides signals that are essential to myocardial growth and repair. Here we
 generate self-organizing human pluripotent stem cell-derived epicardioids
 that display retinoic acid-dependent morphological, molecular and
 functional patterning of the epicardium and myocardium typical of the left
 ventricular wall. By combining lineage tracing, single-cell transcriptomics
 and chromatin accessibility profiling, we describe the specification and
 differentiation process of different cell lineages in epicardioids and draw
 comparisons to human fetal development at the transcriptional and
 morphological levels. We then use epicardioids to investigate the functional
 cross-talk between cardiac cell types, gaining new insights into the role of
 IGF2/IGF1R and NRP2 signaling in human cardiogenesis. Finally, we show
 that epicardioids mimic the multicellular pathogenesis of congenital or
 stress-induced hypertrophy and fibrotic remodeling. As such, epicardioids
 offer a unique testing ground of epicardial activity in heart development,
 disease and regeneration.


The epicardium is the mesothelial cell sheet covering the heart’s outer contributions, the epicardium provides signaling factors critical for

Extended Data Fig. 10 | Epicardioids as in vitro models of cardiac between the epicardial and myocardial compartments. We could demonstrate
development and disease. (a) Graphical representation of the structure that IGF2 secreted by the epicardium stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation
and cell composition of epicardioids, formed by self-organization of hPSCs and compaction, and that NRP2 regulates epicardial EMT and the migration
into myocardial and epicardial compartments. (b) During epicardioid of epicardium-derived cells. (d) Epicardioids are versatile disease models, as
development, juxta-cardiac field ( JCF) progenitors give rise to epicardial cells illustrated by their capacity to recapitulate hypertrophic and fibrotic remodeling
