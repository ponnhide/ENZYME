To passage, organoids were mechanically dislodged from Cultrex domes using a P1000 pipette tip and resuspended in cold 10 mM EDTA with 10 µM Y-27632 (STEMCELL Technologies) in a 15 mL conical tube. The tube containing organoids was then placed on an end-over-end rotator at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 500 ×g, 4 °C.
