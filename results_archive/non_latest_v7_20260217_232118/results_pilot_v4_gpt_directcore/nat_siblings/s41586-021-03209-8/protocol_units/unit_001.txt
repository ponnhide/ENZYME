Cortical organoids were cultured using a forebrain-directed differentiation protocol47,58. In brief, two genetically normal human iPS cell lines (H28126 (Gilad Laboratory, University of Chicago) and 1323-4 (Conklin Laboratory, Gladstone Institutes)), which were previously authenticated47, and the embryonic stem cell line H1 (WiCell, authenticated at source), were expanded and dissociated into single cells using accutase. Cells tested negative for mycoplasma. After dissociation, cells were pelleted at 600g in a swinging bucket rotor centrifuge and washed twice in 200 μl CUT&Tag wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)).
