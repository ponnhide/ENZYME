H3K27ac CUT&Tag libraries were prepared as previously described60, with modifications. In brief, cells were dissociated from human cortical tissue as described above. Fifty thousand cell aliquots were reconstituted in 200 μl CUT&Tag wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Nuclei were isolated by resuspending cell pellets in 200 μl dig‑wash buffer. Primary antibody (1:50 dilution) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C on an overhead rotary shaker rotating at 90 rpm. Excess primary antibody was removed by pelleting the nuclei at 600g and washing twice in 200 μl dig‑wash buffer. Secondary antibody (1:50 dilution) was added at a dilution of 1:50 in 100 μl dig‑wash buffer and nuclei were incubated at room temperature for 30 min while rotating. Excess secondary antibody was removed by pelleting the nuclei at 600g and washing twice in 200 μl dig‑wash buffer. pA‑Tn5 was added at a dilution of 1:100 in 100 μl dig‑med buffer (0.05% digitonin, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail), and nuclei were incubated at room temperature for 1 h while rotating. Unbound pA‑Tn5 was removed by pelleting the nuclei at 300g and washing twice in 200 μl dig‑med buffer. Nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl tagmentation buffer (10 mM MgCl2 in dig‑med buffer) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After tagmentation, nuclei were lysed with the addition of 100 μl DNA binding buffer (Zymo Research), and DNA was purified with a 1.5:1 ratio of AMPure XP beads.
