Cells (10^6) were pelleted and lysed for 3 min in 100 μl chilled lysis buffer (10 mM Tris‑HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween‑20, 0.1% Igepal CA‑630, 0.01% digitonin, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)). Lysed cells were then washed with 1 ml chilled wash buffer (10 mM Tris‑HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween‑20, 1% BSA) and nuclei were pelleted at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C.
