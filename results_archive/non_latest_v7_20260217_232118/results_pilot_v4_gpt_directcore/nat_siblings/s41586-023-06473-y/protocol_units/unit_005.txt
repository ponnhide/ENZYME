we introduced a unique clone barcode (UCB; 1.4 × 10^7 combinations) for each dual sgRNA cassette to label individual lentiviral integration events (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Using this strategy, we obtained an average of 2,770 bulk-extracted genomic DNA from organoid pools of four different embryoid bodies (Fig. 1e).
