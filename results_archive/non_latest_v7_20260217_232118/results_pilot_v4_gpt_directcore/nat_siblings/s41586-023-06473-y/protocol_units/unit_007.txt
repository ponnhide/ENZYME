Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based analyses we found a mean average cell number per clone of 4.4 (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). These data suggest that cells captured in the CHOOSE screen ages throughout development, with an average of 21.8% on day 120 came from diverse and relatively small clones, which are crucial for mitigating dominant clonal effects.
