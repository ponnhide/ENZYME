In this assay, a pre-assembled array of gRNA-targeting sequences fused with TagBFP is used to generate interneurons with lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) origin (LGE-IN; MEIS2) or caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) origin (CGE-IN; NR2F2)28. into the reporter cell lines by lentiviruses. Successful genome editing causes frameshift mutations, resulting in the loss of blue fluorescent protein (BFP) fluorescence, which enables the quantitative evaluation of gRNA efficiency (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c).
