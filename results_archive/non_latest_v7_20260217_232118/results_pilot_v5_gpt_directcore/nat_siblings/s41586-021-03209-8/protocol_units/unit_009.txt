pA-Tn5 was added at a dilution of 1:100 in 100 μl dig-med buffer (0.05% digitonin, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail) and nuclei were incubated at room temperature for 1 h while rotating. Unbound pA-Tn5 was removed by pelleting the nuclei at 300g and washing twice in 200 μl dig-med buffer.
