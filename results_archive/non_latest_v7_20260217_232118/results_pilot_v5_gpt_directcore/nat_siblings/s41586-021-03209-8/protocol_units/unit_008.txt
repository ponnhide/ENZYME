Primary antibody (H3K27ac, Cell Signaling 8173) was added at a dilution of 1:50 in 100 μl dig-wash buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C on an overhead rotary shaker rotating at 90 rpm, and changed to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12-based medium containing 1× glutamax, 1× N2, 1× B27 without vitamin A and 1× antibiotic–antimycotic (anti-anti). Excess primary antibody was removed by pelleting the nuclei at 600g and washing twice in 200 μl dig-wash buffer.
