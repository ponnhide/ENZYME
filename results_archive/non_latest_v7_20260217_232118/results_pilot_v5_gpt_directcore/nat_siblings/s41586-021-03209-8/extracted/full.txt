Open access During mammalian development, differences in chromatin state coincide with
 Check for updates cellular differentiation and reflect changes in the gene regulatory landscape1. In the
 developing brain, cell fate specification and topographic identity are important for
 defining cell identity2 and confer selective vulnerabilities to neurodevelopmental
 disorders3. Here, to identify cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility patterns in the
 developing human brain, we used a single-cell assay for transposase accessibility by
 sequencing (scATAC-seq) in primary tissue samples from the human forebrain. We
 applied unbiased analyses to identify genomic loci that undergo extensive cell-type-
 and brain-region-specific changes in accessibility during neurogenesis, and an
 integrative analysis to predict cell-type-specific candidate regulatory elements. We
 found that cerebral organoids recapitulate most putative cell-type-specific enhancer
 accessibility patterns but lack many cell-type-specific open chromatin regions that
 are found in vivo. Systematic comparison of chromatin accessibility across brain
 regions revealed unexpected diversity among neural progenitor cells in the cerebral
 cortex and implicated retinoic acid signalling in the specification of neuronal lineage
 identity in the prefrontal cortex. Together, our results reveal the important
 contribution of chromatin state to the emerging patterns of cell type diversity and cell
 fate specification and provide a blueprint for evaluating the fidelity and robustness of
 cerebral organoids as a model for cortical development.
