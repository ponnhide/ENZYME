28. Day 10. Aspirate the phase III medium and gently wash the cells with 1 ml of PBS.
29. Remove PBS, add 0.5 ml of Accumax (pre‑warmed to 37 °C) into the well and then put the plate in a 37 °C incubator for 12 min. 6 min after the incubation, remove the plate from the incubator and tap the plate to help the cells detach and better dissociate.
30. After Accumax dissociation, add 0.5 ml of 10% (vol/vol) FBS medium to neutralize the dissociation reaction and pipette up and down gently 10 times to break down the cell clusters into single cells.
31. If using cells with an NPC‑specific reporter such as the SIX2‑GFP;PAX2‑mCherry dual reporter, follow option A. For iNPC line derivation from hPSC lines that have no NPC‑specific reporters for FACS, follow option B. Alternatively, if there are large populations of off‑target cells after hPSC‑to‑iNPC differentiation, follow option C to sort for cell surface marker ITGA8 via FACS.
