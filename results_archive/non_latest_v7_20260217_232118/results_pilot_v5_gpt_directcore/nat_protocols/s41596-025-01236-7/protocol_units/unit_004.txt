17. Seed 40,000 hPSCs in one Matrigel‑coated well of a 12‑well plate with 1 ml of mTeSR Plus medium supplemented with 10 µM Y27632.
▲ CRITICAL STEP An accurate initial hPSC seeding number is very critical for differentiation.
▲ CRITICAL STEP It is important to add 10 µM Y27632 to increase the survival of the hPSCs during seeding.
