32. Day 0. If continuing after FACS (Step 31A or C), count the cells with a TC20 automated cell counter and seed ~120,000 cells per well to one Matrigel‑coated well of a 12‑well plate with 1 ml of hNPSR‑v2 medium. (From our experiences, FACS from one well of a 12‑well plate can lead to the isolation of 200,000–300,000 SIX2+ iNPCs. Please scale up or down as needed.)
33. Return the cultures to the incubator. Typically, it takes 4 d for each sorted iNPC passage cycle at the split ratio of 1:10 (Fig. 3a). (From our experiences, a confluent well of a 12‑well plate can produce 1–1.5 million iNPCs.)
34. Day 1. Observe iNPCs under the microscope to ensure that the cells are attached to the plate. It is common to find dead cells floating, which is normal from FACS. No medium change is needed.
35. Day 2. Change the medium to 1 ml of fresh hNPSR‑v2 medium.
36. Day 4. Observe iNPCs under the microscope to check confluence. iNPCs should have reached 80–90% confluence and will be ready for passaging or cryopreservation (D4 in Fig. 3a).
