11. Aspirate 1 ml of PBS and add 0.5 ml of Accumax solution (pre‑warmed to 37 °C) and put the plate in an incubator for 12–18 min. Every 3–4 min, take the plate out of the incubator and tap gently to facilitate hPSC dissociation. The dissociation is considered complete when most of the hPSCs are detached from the plate, with most of the floating hPSCs as either single cells or small clusters with fewer than five cells.
▲ CRITICAL STEP Complete dissociation of hPSCs into single cells is very important for accurate hPSC seeding, which will have significant effects on the efficiency of hPSC‑to‑iNPC differentiation.
12. After Accumax dissociation, add 0.5 ml of mTeSR Plus medium supplemented with 10 µM Y27632 to neutralize the digestion reaction. Now, the total volume of cell solution is ~1 ml.
13. Pipette up and down gently 10 times to break down the cell clusters into a single‑cell solution.
