Reverse transcribe 100–1,000 ng of total RNA using the qScript XLT cDNA SuperMix. Combine following reagents in 0.2 ml microtubes:

Component Volume for 20 μl reaction

qScript XLT cDNA SuperMix 4 μl
RNA template Variable
RNase-/DNase-free water Variable
Total volume 20 μl

After sealing each reaction, vortex gently to mix contents. Centrifuge brieﬂy to collect components at the bottom of the reaction tube.
Incubate as follows: 5 min at 25 °C, 60 min at 42 °C, 5 min at 85 °C, hold at 4 °C. Use ﬁrst-strand product for RT–qPCR ampliﬁcation.
