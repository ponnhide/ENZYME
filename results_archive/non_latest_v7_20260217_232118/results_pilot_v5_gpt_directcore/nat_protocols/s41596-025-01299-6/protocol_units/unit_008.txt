67. The sgRNA mix comes in a 96-well plate. Warm the plate to room temperature.
68. Vortex the plate at low speed for 30 s and then centrifuge the plate for 5 min at 500g.
69. Mix 300 pmol of sgRNA with 40 pmol of Cas9 protein in a V-shaped 96-well plate to form an RNP complex for sgRNAs targeting each gene. The stock of our sgRNAs was 100 pmol μl−1 and the Cas9 was 20 pmol μl−1. Therefore, the total volume of our mix was 5 μl.
70. Incubate the RNPs at room temperature for 10 min and then place them on ice until use.
