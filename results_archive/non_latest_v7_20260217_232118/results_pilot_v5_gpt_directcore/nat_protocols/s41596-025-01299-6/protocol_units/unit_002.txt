6. Aspirate the medium from each well and replace it with 1 ml of pre-warmed E8 medium supplemented with 5 μg ml−1 polybrene and the empirically determined volume of lentivirus encoding the sgRNA library. After 8 h, add another 1 ml of E8 medium to each well. Place the plate back in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Maintain one plate of uninfected hiPS cells as a negative control.
7. Maintain hiPS cell cultures by replacing the medium daily with 3 ml of pre-warmed E8 medium. Closely monitor the state of the hiPS cells each day before medium change.
