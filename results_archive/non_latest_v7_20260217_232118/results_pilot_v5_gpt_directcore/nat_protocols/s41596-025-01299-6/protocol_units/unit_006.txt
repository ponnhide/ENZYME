40. Transfer one hCO and one hSO into the same well of a 24-well low-attachment plate by using the P1000 pipette tips with wide orifice. Fill each well with 2 ml of NM. Tilt the plate slightly to guide both organoids toward the edge of the well. Using a P20 pipette tip, gently position the hCO and hSO so that they are in contact with each other (Fig. 3f).
41. Once the assembloids are set up across the entire plate, carefully transfer the plate to a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2, ensuring that the plate remains tilted (Fig. 3g). Keep the plates in the tilted position for 4 d without disturbing them.
42. Change the medium for the hFA every 4 d by replacing 2 ml of NM. Handle the aspiration and refilling carefully to avoid disrupting the assembloids.
43. Thirty days after assembloid formation, assess interneuron migration in the hFA by using a fluorescence microscope. GFP+ cells that have migrated to the hCO region should be readily visible (Fig. 3h). hFA with minimal interneuron migration to the hCO side were excluded from analysis (~10% of total hFA were excluded on the basis of this criterion).
