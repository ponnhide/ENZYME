85. PCR amplification. To validate KO efficiency, amplify the genomic DNA (gDNA) by using primers flanking the sgRNA target sites. Because three sgRNAs were used per candidate gene (Fig. 4a), we expect the KO cells to exhibit segmental deletions. As a result, PCR amplification from KO cells will produce a smaller amplicon. In cases of high KO efficiency, only the smaller KO band is detected (Fig. 4b).
