44. Transfer one hFA into a 10-cm dish. Aspirate the medium as much as possible.
45. Align the assembloid with the hCO on the left and the hSO on the right (Fig. 3i). Use a fluorescence microscope to confirm the identity of the hSO by checking the hFA, as the hSO should show many Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells.
46. Carefully separate the two organoids at the boundary of the fusion with tweezers or scissors.
47. Collect the hCO and hSO into separate dishes with NM. Save the samples in the incubator until the next step.
48. Repeat this process for the rest of the hFA.
49. Pool eight organoids per well and then proceed with dissociation. A few control hSO (uninfected) should be dissociated at this step to be used as a negative control for FACS.
50. Remove the extra medium from each well and add 3 ml of enzyme solution with papain (30 U ml−1) to the well. Incubate the samples at 37 °C for 45 min in a 5% CO2 incubator. Gently swirl the plate every 15 min to evenly distribute the enzyme solution.
51. After digestion with the enzyme solution, transfer the sample and enzyme solution to a 15-ml conical tube.
