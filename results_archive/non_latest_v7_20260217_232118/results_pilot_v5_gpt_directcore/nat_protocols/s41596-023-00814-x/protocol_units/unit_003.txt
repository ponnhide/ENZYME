9 Aspirate the PFA carefully and gently add 500 µl PBS‑Glycine to wash out the PFA. Repeat the washing step two more times.
CRITICAL Perform the washing steps carefully not to detach the fixed adherent cells.
10 Aspirate the PBS‑Glycine after the third time washing and add 500 µl of permeabilization solution. Incubate for 10 min at RT.
11 Aspirate the permeabilzation solution and wash three times with 500 µl PBS‑Glycine.
12 Aspirate the PBS‑Glycine after the third time of washing and add 500 µl of blocking solution.
PAUSE POINT Store plate at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks wrapped with Parafilm to prevent evaporation and drying out of the fixed cells, or proceed with the immunostaining after 1 h incubation at RT with blocking solution.
