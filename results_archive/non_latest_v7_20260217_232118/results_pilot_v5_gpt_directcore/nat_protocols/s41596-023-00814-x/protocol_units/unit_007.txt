3 Dissociate the organoids to small aggregates by adding 3 ml of 0.05% Trypsin and incubating for 20 min at 37 °C.
4 To stop the reaction, inhibit Trypsin by adding 6 ml of 20% FBS‑DMEM.
5 Collect darkly pigmented aggregates in a separate 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 1,000g for 3 min at RT.
6 Resuspend the pigmented aggregate pellet in RPE medium (Table 6) and seed them onto laminin‑coated cell culture treated dishes.
