5 When iPSC colonies/patches have reached a diameter of 200–500 µm, proceed with the fixation.
6 Aspirate the medium and gently add 500 µl DMEM/F12 (prewarmed in a 37 °C warm water bath) to each well.
7 Aspirate the DMEM/F12 and gently add 500 µl PFA (prewarmed in a 37 °C warm water bath) gently to each well without detaching the cells.
8 Incubate the plate for 10 min at RT.
