Isolated SNRs are cultured in suspension on an orbital shaker at 45 rpm with the amplification medium containing EGF (10 ng/mL) and FGF2 (10 ng/mL). We use a multichannel pipettor for half medium changes every other day. The fresh medium contains 2× EGF (20 ng/mL) and 2× FGF2 (20 ng/mL) to maintain the final concentrations of these growth factors at 10 ng/mL. At this stage, it is important to confirm tissue growth. In our preliminary experiments, we discovered that organoids failed to grow in the amplification medium without FGF2. We take images of SNR‑derived organoids at 1, 7 and 14 d post‑isolation (Fig. 3). One‑month‑old SNR‑derived organoids that exhibit consistent growth and a distinct singular lumen can be MG embedding in Stage 5 (Fig. 5).
