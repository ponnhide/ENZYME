13. To passage one well, warm 1 mL dispase, 6 mL Essential 8 medium and 9 mL stem cell medium. Prepare MG‑coated plates. Add 4.5 µL of Y‑27632 (1:2,000) to warmed stem cell medium.
14. Aspirate 100% of the old stem cell medium and add 1 mL dispase.
15. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 5–8 min, monitoring the progress of dissociation. When the edges of PS cell colonies become partially detached, aspirate dispase and wash cells with Essential 8 medium three times (2 mL per wash).
16. After the last wash, add 3 mL of stem cell medium and scrape cells off the plate gently using a cell scraper.
17. Gently triturate detached colonies using a 1 mL pipette tip 5 times (or a 5 mL serological pipet 10–15 times) to break them into smaller pieces.
18. We usually split PS cells 1:3. For this, transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube and adjust the total volume of stem cell medium with Y‑27632 to 9 mL.
19. Add 3 mL of cell suspension to each MG‑coated well.
20. Place the plate with dissociated cells in the incubator and move it back‑to‑forth and left‑to‑right a few times to evenly spread the cells over the entire surface.
21. Change the medium daily by removing ~90% of the old media and adding 3 mL of fresh stem cell medium without Y‑27632 until cells reach ~90% confluency.
