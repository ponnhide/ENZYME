SNR‑derived organoids with a clearly visible singular lumen are embedded in MG on days 14–15 post‑isolation (~1 month post‑induction) (Fig. 1). During embedding, the individual organoids are placed into Parafilm dimples (one organoid per dimple), which are then filled with MG (25 µL per dimple) and transferred to a 37 °C, 5% CO₂ incubator for MG gelation (Fig. 5a). The gelated MG droplets containing organoids are then transferred into 10 cm Petri dishes (5–7 organoids per dish) for long‑term culture on an orbital shaker in a 37 °C, 5% CO₂ incubator.
