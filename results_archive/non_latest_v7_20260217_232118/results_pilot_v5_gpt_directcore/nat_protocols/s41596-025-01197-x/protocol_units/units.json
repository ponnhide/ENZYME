The dual‑SMAD inhibitors induce the neuralization of ectodermal tissue while destabilizing the pluripotency gene expression networks and suppressing the induction of mesodermal fates in PS cells. Thus, we use the dual‑SMAD inhibitors dorsomorphin (4 μM) and SB‑431542 (10 μM) in neurobasal media with the vitamin A‑containing B27 supplement for neural induction (Figs. 1 and 2a–c).",

Once the sheet of cells is detached, carefully transfer it into a 15 mL conical tube using a 5 mL serological pipet.\n28. Let the cell clump settle to the bottom of the tube by gravity. This will take 1–2 min. Then, carefully remove the supernatant using a 1 mL pipet to avoid disturbing the clump at the bottom.\n29. Wash it three times using 3 mL N2/B27 medium. During each washing step, dislodge the clump from the bottom of the tube with medium while carefully avoiding breaking it into pieces. Let it settle to the bottom of the tube after each wash.\n30. After the last wash, add 4 mL amplification medium and gently triturate (~5 times) the clump of cells using a 5 mL pipette to break it into small clumps of cells that are ~750 µm by 750 µm in size. Check the size under the microscope.\n31. Replate the resultant clumps of cell at low density to promote NR formation. We usually replate one well into three or four 35 mm dishes. To replate into three dishes, transfer all cell clumps into a 15 mL conical tube and adjust the total volume with amplification medium to 12 mL. If replating four dishes, scale the total volume to 16 mL. Then, split the total volume between three MG‑coated dishes.\n32.

Place the Parafilm over of the plastic portion of an empty P200 pipette tip holder (the section with holes). Using the rubber end of a 3 mL syringe plunger, apply pressure to the parafilm directly above a hole to form a dimple to be filled with MG. Repeat this step to make the necessary number of dimples (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b).\n49. Carefully detach the Parafilm square from the pipette tip holder by peeling it away from the surface while maintaining the dimple shape.\n50. Place the dimpled Parafilm square on the inside of a sterile 10 cm Petri dish lid and press the Parafilm corners onto the surface using a fingernail so that it becomes stuck to the lid. This will tilt the corners without squashing the dimples (Supplementary Fig. 1c).\n51.
