Option A: dissociation procedures for 1‑month‑old organoids
● TIMING 1–2 h
(i) Transfer 1‑month‑old organoids (before MG embedding) to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube using a P200 pipette tip cut to avoid damaging the organoids. Let organoids settle to the bottom, aspirate the medium and rinse once with sterile PBS. Carefully remove the PBS without collecting organoids.
(ii) Transfer the organoids to a 6 cm dish and chop them into small pieces using a scalpel. Collect pieces into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 rpm (300 g) at room temperature.
(iii) Discard the supernatant, add 500 µL of prewarmed papain with 5% DNase I and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min, gently tapping the tube every 10 min.
(iv) Discard the papain solution, add 500 µL of trypsin inhibitor, and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.
(v) Dissociate organoids into single cells by repeated pipetting with a P1000 pipette.
(vi) Centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 rpm.
(vii) Resuspend the cell pellet in 300 µL sterile PBS containing 0.04% BSA and filter the solution through a 40 µm cell strainer to obtain a single‑cell suspension.
(viii) Keep samples on ice.
