During the next 4 months, organoids substantially increase in size and exhibit notable cell migration and process extension into the MG (Fig. 5). Between 3 and 4 months post‑MG embedding (4 and 5 months post‑induction), the organoids are treated with BDNF (10 ng/mL), NT3 (10 ng/mL) and GDNF (10 ng/mL) to promote neuronal and network maturation (Fig. 1). We usually use 5‑month‑old organoids for scRNA‑seq, immunohistochemistry and slice patch‑clamp electrophysiology (see the ‘Downstream assays’ section).
