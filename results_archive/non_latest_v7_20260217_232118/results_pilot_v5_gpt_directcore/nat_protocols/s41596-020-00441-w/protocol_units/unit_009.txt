44 Add 20–30 µl/well of 100 % Matrigel (Phenol Red‑Free) on ice to the fused A‑P spheroid in a 1.5‑ml tube. Gently re‑suspend the single A‑P spheroid by using a mechanical pipette with a wide‑bore 200‑µl tip and slowly plate it on a 24‑well tissue culture plate (VWR International) to make a Matrigel drop.
45 Incubate the drop in a CO₂ incubator at 37 °C for 5 min.
