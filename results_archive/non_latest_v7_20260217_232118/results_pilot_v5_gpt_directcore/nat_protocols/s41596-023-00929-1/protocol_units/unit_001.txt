1. Turn on rotating oven and allow it to heat up to 37 °C while you prepare your sample.
2. Obtain a 60 mm cell culture dish containing ~7 mL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.
3. Add 150 µL of pre-aliquoted DNase (10 mg/mL) to each dish.
4. Obtain ~250 mg of human brain tissue per sample. Document case details.
▲ Caution Local institutional guidelines should always be followed when using human source materials since they can contain blood-borne pathogens. These protocols probably will include training, proper engineering and personal barrier protections.
5. Place in dish containing HBSS/BSA/glucose + DNase.
▲ Critical step It is crucial DNase is added to the solution at this step otherwise digestion will be inadequate. See also the troubleshooting advice for Steps 9 and 54.
6. With a scalpel, cut tissue into small (~2 mm × 2 mm chunks) in HBSS/BSA/glucose + DNase solution in a sterile environment (Fig. 2).
▲ Critical step Ideally, dissection should occur in a cell culture biosafety cabinet. If this is not possible, the tissue can be dissected outside of a hood with attention paid to best aseptic technique.
