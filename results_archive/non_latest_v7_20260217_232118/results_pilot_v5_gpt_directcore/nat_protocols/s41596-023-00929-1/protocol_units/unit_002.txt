11. After samples have finished spinning, discard the supernatant by pouring out the liquid into a waste container.
▲ Critical step Do not aspirate the supernatant during the cell dissociation and digestion, as the cell pellet may be aspirated and lost.
12. Add 1 mL of HBSS/BSA/glucose and 50 µL of pre-aliquoted DNase (10 mg/mL) into each sample tube.
13. Gently mix/resuspend 50 times using a micropipette, taking care not to introduce bubbles, which may detrimentally affect the cells49.
14. Obtain two additional 15 mL conical tubes per each sample tube. For example, for three sample digestion tubes, obtain six tubes for Percoll filtration.
▲ Critical step Yield will be compromised if each digestion is not distributed into two Percoll tubes.
15. Dispense 4 mL of 22% Percoll into each new conical tube.
16. Carefully dispense cell suspension from each sample tube into the new conical tubes containing 22% Percoll in equal amounts. Use ~750 µL per tube.
▲ Critical step The cell suspension should be dispensed on top of the Percoll.
17. Spin down for 10 min at 500g, 4 °C with no deceleration.
18. Discard supernatant.
19. Reunite contents of all Percoll tubes into one tube by resuspending the cell pellet in the HBSS/BSA/glucose remaining after pouring out the supernatant.
20. Spin down the sample tube for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.
21. Do not discard the remaining tubes. The small amount of cells left over after combining the majority of cells into one tube for the master mix can be used for unstained and DAPI controls (Steps 36–45).
