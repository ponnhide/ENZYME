Immediately remove 10 µL of the cell suspension for counting with a hemocytometer. Typically, prolonged differentiation in CDBLY2 will yield 5 × 10⁶ cells per well. A minimum of 11.25 × 10⁶ cells will be required for 45 organoids to perform both PT functional assays and immunofluorescence outlined below.
Calculate the cell suspension volume required for 250,000 cells and dispense this volume into individual 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, allowing one tube per organoid (Fig. 1). For the generation of 45 organoids, we recommend preparing two or three extra tubes of 250,000 cells in case the cell micromass breaks during aspiration.
