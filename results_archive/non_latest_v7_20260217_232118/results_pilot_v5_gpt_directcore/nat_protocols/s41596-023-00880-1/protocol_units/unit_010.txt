Day 27: set aside two plates (12 wells) of organoids for PT functionality assays (albumin and DAPI uptake, detailed in Steps 52–59 and 60–71) and remove the remaining plate of three wells from the incubator to undergo fixation for later immunofluorescence.
For fixation, aspirate medium from the base of the transwell and replace with 1 mL per well of cold 4 % PFA, also adding one drop of PFA on top of each organoid. Incubate the plate for 30 min at 4 °C, then remove PFA using a P1000 pipette and discard in the appropriate PFA waste container. Wash three times with PBS, 10 min per wash in the same manner as fixation, adding 1 mL of PBS to the basolateral Transwell compartment and one drop on top of each organoid.
