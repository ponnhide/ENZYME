Top up the medium volume in each tube to 200 µL with E6/2 % FBS.
Centrifuge tubes three times at 300 g for 3 min, rotating the tubes 180° between each centrifugation step. While centrifugation can be performed in two batches if only a 24‑tube rotor is available, it is preferable for all tubes to be centrifuged simultaneously, either by using two centrifuges or a larger capacity rotor.
▲ CRITICAL STEP If centrifugation is to be performed in batches, begin transferring the first batch of cell micromasses to the Transwell inserts (Step 46) while the second batch is underway to minimize delay.
