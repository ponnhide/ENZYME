17 Add 500 µl of collagenase (20 mg/ml stock, ﬁnal concentration 1 mg/ml) and 10 µl of ROCK inhibitor (10 mM stock, ﬁnal concentration 10 µM) to the 50-ml Falcon tube containing the minced tissue.
18 Wrap the 50-ml Falcon tube with Paraﬁlm and place the tube at a slight angle (~15°) on top of an orbital shaker located inside a heated incubator oven at 37 °C. Set the orbital shaker at 140 r.p.m. and digest the tissue for 1–2 h. At this moment, the processing of the next tissue can be initiated.
19 Pipette up and down 5–10 times every 30 min using a 5-ml sterile serological pipette pre-wetted with D-BSA medium to aid digestion. Monitor the digestion of the tissue at least every 30 min, using an inverted bright‑field microscope (×5, ×10 or ×20 objective). When clusters of 5–10 cells are observed (Fig. 2g), digestion is complete.
