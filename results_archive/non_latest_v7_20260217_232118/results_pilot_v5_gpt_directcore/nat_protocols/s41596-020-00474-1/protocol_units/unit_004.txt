20 After incubation, take the tube from the heated incubator oven and clean with 70% EtOH. Add 1 ml of FBS directly to the 50-ml Falcon tube to stop the collagenase digestion.
21 Homogenize the digested tissue by pipetting it up and down vigorously with a 10-ml sterile serological pipette pre-wetted with D-BSA.
22 Pre-wet a 100‑µm strainer by pipetting 10 ml of D‑BSA on the strainer into a new 50‑ml Falcon tube. Swirl the 50‑ml tube to wet the sides of the tube and discard the D‑BSA. Then, strain the digested tissue over the 100‑µm strainer into the 50‑ml Falcon tube (both pre‑wetted with D‑BSA).
