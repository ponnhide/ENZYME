1 Transfer each tissue sample (<3–4 cm3) into a separate 50-ml Falcon tube ﬁlled with D-BSA. Keep tissues on ice until starting the isolation.
2 Register the new sample in the corresponding lab management system.
3 (Optional) Generate labels for collecting pieces of tissue for different purposes (DNA, RNA, protein and/or histology).
4 Collect the 50-ml Falcon tube containing the normal or tumor tissue and transfer the tissue to a 10-cm glass Petri dish by decanting the 50-ml Falcon tube (Fig. 2c).
5 Take a microscopic picture of the tissue, including a ruler in the picture (Fig. 2c). Make a note of how the tissue looks (ie, size, fatty, vascularized, necrotic, etc) in the corresponding lab note.
6 Aspirate the excess D-BSA and cut the tissue into small pieces (2–4 mm3) using two scalpels by holding one scalpel in each hand and slicing the tissue while pressing the blades of both scalpels against each other.
