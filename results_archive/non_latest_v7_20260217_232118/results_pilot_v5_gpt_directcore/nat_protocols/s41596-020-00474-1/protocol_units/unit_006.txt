31 (Optional) If the pellet is partially red, add 1–2 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer with a P1000 pipette, resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down several times and incubate for 2 min at RT before continuing with Step 32.
CRITICAL For pellets <100 μl in size, 1 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer is sufficient. For pellets >100 μl, use 2 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer.
