(Optional) Add 10 µM ROCK inhibitor to adDMEM/F12+++ medium to increase cell survival. Keep tissue samples in this medium at 4 °C until the start of the isolation.\n2 Assess whether obtained tissue pieces consist purely of epithelium or if they also contain fat or muscle tissue. If so, remove non-epithelial components as much as possible using surgical scissors or scalpels and forceps under a dissection microscope. If not, continue to the next step immediately.\n3 Mince the tissue into small fragments of 1–3 mm3 in a 10-cm cell culture dish using surgical scissors or scalpels.\n4 Fix one or two representative fragments in ﬁxative (i.e., 10% (wt/vol) formalin or 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde) for histological analysis.\n5 Snap-freeze fragments for molecular (i.e., whole exome/genome sequencing or mRNA sequencing) or biochemical (i.e., Western blotting or proteomics) analysis at –80 °C.
