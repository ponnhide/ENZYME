7 When the mixture becomes cloudy and the remaining tissue fragments are disrupted, further aid tissue disruption by pipetting up and down 10–20 times using a P1000 pipette. Wash once by topping up with 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium, and centrifuge at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C.
8 Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium, and ﬁlter using a 100-µm cell strainer.
9 Centrifuge the resuspended and ﬁltered cells at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C.
10 Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in BME or Matrigel. BME should be kept on ice to prevent it from solidifying; thus, work quickly. The amount of BME depends on the size of the pellet. Approximately 10,000 cells should be plated in 40 µl of BME.
