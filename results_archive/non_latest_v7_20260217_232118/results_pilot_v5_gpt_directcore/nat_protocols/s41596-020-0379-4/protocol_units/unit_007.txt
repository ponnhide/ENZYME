21 After shearing is complete, wash with 10 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium.
22 Resuspend the organoid pellet in 70% (vol/vol) BME, and plate organoids in small droplets on the bottom of a pre‑warmed culture plate as described in Steps 10–13. After plating is complete, invert the plate and place it in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2 for 30–60 min.
23 Pre‑warm organoid medium containing 10 µM ROCK inhibitor at 37 °C.
24 After BME drops have solidiﬁed (30–60 min), carefully pipette pre‑warmed medium into the wells.
25 Place culture plates in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2 until the organoids are needed for the drug screen.
