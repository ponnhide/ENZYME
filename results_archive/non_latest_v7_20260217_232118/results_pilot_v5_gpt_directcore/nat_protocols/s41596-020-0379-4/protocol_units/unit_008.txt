26 2–3 d after splitting, remove the medium, and add 500 µl of adDMEM/F12+++ medium into each well. Break up the BME drops using a P1000 ﬁlter tip, and transfer the material to an ice‑cold 15‑ml conical tube.
27 (Optional) If you are freezing more wells or several cell culture plates, adjust the number of 15‑ml conical tubes accordingly.
28 (Optional) If there are large amounts of BME, ﬁll up the 15‑ml conical tubes containing the organoids to a total volume of 12 ml with ice‑cold adDMEM/F12+++ medium, pipette up and down with a pre‑wetted (using adDMEM/F12+++) 10‑ml serological pipette and put the tube on ice for 10 min. Pipette up and down again several times with a 10‑ml serological pipette. Leaving the sample on ice longer will further dissolve the BME.
29 Centrifuge the organoids at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C.
30 Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.
31 (Optional) If multiple 15‑ml conical tubes were used to collect one organoid culture, resuspend the pellet of each 15‑ml conical tube in 1 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium, and transfer them all into a 15‑ml conical tube. Centrifuge the organoids again at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C, and aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.
32 Add the required volume of cell‑freezing medium, and pipette up and down using a P1000 pipette to properly resuspend the organoids.
33 Per sterile cryogenic vial, add 500 µl of freezing medium with the resuspended organoids.
34 Place the cryogenic vial into a freezing container. Store the freezing container with the samples at –80 °C.
35 After storage at –80 °C for 24 h, remove the vials from the freezing container, and transfer them to the liquid nitrogen tank (approximately –180 °C).
