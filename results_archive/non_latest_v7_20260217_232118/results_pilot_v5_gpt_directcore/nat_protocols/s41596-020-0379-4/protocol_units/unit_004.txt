11 Plate the BME containing organoids on the bottom of pre-heated 24-well suspension cell culture plates in drops of ~10 µl each. Place three to four drops into each well.
12 Place the culture plate into a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2 for 20–30 min to let the BME solidify.
13 Prepare the required amount of organoid medium (tissue-speciﬁc growth factors are listed in Supplementary Table 1), add 10 µM ROCK inhibitor and Primocin (100 µg/ml) and place medium in the 37 °C water bath. For head and neck organoids, additionally add 0.5 µg/ml caspofungin to the human head and neck organoid medium (see Reagent setup).
14 Once the BME drops are solidiﬁed (30–60 min), ﬂip the plate and carefully add 500 µl of organoid medium to each well.
