Dispense 250 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose into each of the four remaining FACS tubes.
Add 2.5 µL of a single antibody to each single-color control tube into the FACS tubes containing 250 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.
For the live/dead stain, add 1.25 µL of DAPI into the FACS tubes containing 250 µL of combined buffer/cell rinse. One tube will be unstained.
After adding antibodies as explained in Step 43, shake the UltraComp eBead vial and add one drop of beads to each single-color control with the ‘Ready to Use’ bottle.
