11 Prepare a stock cell suspension at a concentration of 5,000 cells per 100 µL medium by adding an appropriate amount of cells from Step 10 (based on the desired number of HFOs) to E8 + 10 μM Y27632. Gently resuspend the cells.
12 Seed 100 µL of the stock cell suspension per well of a U-shaped ultra-low attachment 96-well plate. Seed 12 wells (one row) more than the number of desired HFOs (Table 1).
