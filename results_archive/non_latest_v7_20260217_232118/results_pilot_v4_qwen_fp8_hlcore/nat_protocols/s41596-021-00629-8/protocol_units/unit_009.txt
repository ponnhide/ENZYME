2 Take the confluent T25 flask (Fig. 3b; confluency is typically reached 2–4 d after seeding), aspirate the medium and add 5 mL of PBS w/o. Aspirate the PBS w/o, add 1 mL of Accutase and place the plate into the incubator.
3 Add 5 mL of DMEM/F12 to the flask, and rinse the flask bottom with the medium to detach the cells. Transfer the resulting cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube, and centrifuge the tube at 300g for 3 min at 4 °C.
4 Remove the supernatant, and gently resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of E8 + 10 μM Y27632.
5 Count the cells and assess the cell viability by applying Trypan blue staining in a hemocytometer using standard methods (and previously described33).
6 Take a prepared Geltrex-coated T25 flask, aspirate the medium and add 5 mL E8 + 10 μM Y27632.
7 Add 0.5–1.0 × 10^6 cells to the flask, and place it into the incubator. Move the flask a few times back and forth and left to right at the point where it is placed in the incubator to ensure that the cells are equally distributed (Supplementary Video 1).
