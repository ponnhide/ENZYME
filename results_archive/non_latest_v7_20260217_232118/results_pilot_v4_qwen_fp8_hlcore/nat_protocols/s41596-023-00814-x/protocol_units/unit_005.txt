Procedure
 1 Collect three to ﬁve OVB organoids of day 60 in a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for transferring organoids.
 2 Remove any of the carried-over medium carefully with a 200 µl micropipette tip without disturbing the organoids. Wash organoids once with 1 ml
 of DMEM/F12 (prewarmed to 37 °C in a water bath) for 3 min and withdraw the DMEM/F12.
 3 Dissociate the organoids to small aggregates by adding 3 ml of 0.05% Trypsin and incubating for 20 min at 37 °C.
 4 To stop the reaction, inhibit Trypsin by adding 6 ml of 20% FBS-DMEM.
 5 Collect darkly pigmented aggregates in a separate 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 1,000g for 3 min at RT.
 6 Resuspend the pigmented aggregate pellet in RPE medium (Table 6) and seed them onto laminin-coated cell culture treated dishes.
 7 Incubate dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the incubator.
 8 Within the next 2 weeks, you can observe expanding colonies of pigmented cells growing as adherent monolayer sheets.
 9 To subculture the RPE cells and obtain a pure RPE culture, one can optionally pick pigmented colonies and transfer small aggregates to a new
 laminin-coated TC-treated dish.


 transplanted cells, these precursors can differentiate within their in vivo niche to terminally differ-
 entiated and fully functional cell types. Although untested, the qualities of these cells, hypothetically,
 maybe better than those derived from the directed differentiation of iPSCs in 2D. Thus, when
 generated in suitable conditions with strict good manufacturing standards, OVB organoids could be
