 tissue part
 ● Validation of successful differentiation is only possible after 30 d of culture

 ● Culturing OVB organoids beyond 60 d leads to the degradation and collapse of organoids

 ● Unique expertise for human iPS cell cultivation and differentiation is necessary

 ● Culturing optimization may be required due to the erratic behavior of iPSCs donors


 Experimental design
 In all cases, it is necessary to check each iPSC line for the capacity to differentiate into all three
 germ layers (ecto-, meso- and endoderm) by the standard differentiation protocol with traditional
 markers, and to check that cells are free from contaminants. It is noteworthy that even if an iPSC
 line generates neural progenitor cells4,6,32 (as veriﬁed by the expression of Nestin, for example), it
 does not guarantee that the same cell line could generate all other mature cell types of the neuronal
 lineages such as photoreceptors or RPE cells. Testing the standard three germ layers indicates that
 the iPSC line is pluripotent and can form the progenitor cells of each germ layer. This could be a
 likely scenario if one uses a transgenic iPSC line reprogrammed by a lentiviral-based system.
 Lentiviral transduction can introduce transgenes at multiple random sites into the genome. By
 chance, a transgene could be inserted into a coding sequence or a regulatory element critical for
 RPE cells’ development or function. Thus, it is advisable to consider the possibility of random
 integration.

 Designing strategies
 Before the researcher starts designing the experiments, certain aspects have to be taken into
 consideration:
 1 For modeling genetic diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, oculocutaneous
 albinism, and so on, it is necessary to access patient-derived iPSC lines from stem cell biobanks or
 to reprogram patient materials in the laboratory. If no patient iPSCs are available, the disease-
 causing mutation can be introduced in isogenic iPSCs by genetic engineering methods such as
 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated protein 9 (CRISPR–Cas9)
 technology.
 2 For developmental studies and live imaging, transgenic iPSC lines with ﬂuorescent reporters, for
 example, under a tissue-speciﬁc promoter such as retinal progenitors or eye ﬁeld, can be used.
 3 For cell lineage tracing during development, barcoding methods for cells have been described44.
 Before starting the differentiation, this has to be done on the iPSC level in advance.


NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 18 | JUNE 2023 | 1893–1929 | www.nature.com/nprot 1903

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 Control cell lines
 1 As a control line for patient iPSCs, using iPSCs from at least two different healthy donors of the
 same gender, cell origin and age group is recommended.
 2 For the CRISPR–Cas9-engineered iPSCs, use the parental cell line used for the CRISPR–Cas9
 (‘isogenic control’).
 3 For the ectopic expression of a mutant transgene, use the original cell line expressing the wild-type
 gene as a control.

 Possible variations in the cell line
 We have generated OVB organoids from ﬁve human iPS cell lines, and the percentage of organoids
 containing one or two pigmented areas changes signiﬁcantly among the different cell lines
 (‘Anticipated results’).
 Several studies report that the cell type from which your selected iPSCs originate might inﬂuence
 the differentiation efﬁciency45,46. We have experienced this ‘somatic memory effect’ when using the
 CRX-iPSC that were reprogrammed from Müller ganglion cells, for which we observed an earlier RPE
 cell occurrence than other lines.

 Protocol modiﬁcations
 The protocol we describe here not only allows the study of OV development but can also be utilized
 for studying forebrain development, axis formation, cyclopia, ganglionic eminence, optic stalk or
 optic tract development. However, this protocol could be modiﬁed to obtain organoids emphasizing
 these structures. For example, adding media supplements that support neuronal maturation and
 function (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, BrainPhys
 medium47) to the OVB medium could improve the neuronal activity in the OVB organoids. Notably,
 continued organoid growth beyond 60 d with other neuron-supporting media or inducing vascu-
 latures could enhance the neuronal circuitry and further development of the RGCs, optic tract, LGN
 and visual cortex area.

 Statistical requirements
 In all cases, we recommend setting up at least three independent experiments (N = 3 batches) of
 organoid cultures to accomplish statistically meaningful results. For a single batch (N = 1), start from
 the thawing of the iPSC line and proceed with differentiation until the required day of OVB organoid
 protocol. Repeat this procedure twice for batches two and three (N = 3). In each batch, at least three
 individual organoids (n = 3; technical replicates) per timepoint, treatment or condition must be
 analyzed to get statistically meaningful results. For example, to perform four different analyses such
 as IF, western blot, ERGs, and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
 (qRT–PCR), one should use n = 12 organoids for each test method (n = 12; 3× IF, 3× western blot,
 3× ERGs and 3× qRT–PCR). The exact number of replicates should be used for respective control
 experiments.

 Limitations
 This protocol produces organoids within 50–60 d, which comprise a wide diversity of immature
 neuronal, non-neuronal and retinal cell types, matching Capowski stage 2–3 (ref. 16). However, as the
 protocol described here consumes ~50–60 d across multiple stages, it is prone to the accumulation of
 mistakes. These can further be magniﬁed, eventually leading to an unsuccessful generation of OVB
 organoids. Although we provide a step-by-step protocol, the problems and troubleshooting can be
 frustratingly delayed due to the different steps involved. Furthermore, having tested the method’s
 robustness with ﬁve different iPSC donors, we expect success rates to vary signiﬁcantly among the
 donor lines.
 Even though the described protocol allows the generation of OVB organoids exhibiting a wide
 diversity of various neuronal, non-neuronal and retinal cell types, the nature of cell types is mostly
 immature and matched to Capowski stages 2–3 (ref. 16). This could be because the viability of
 organoids is limited beyond day 60. This poor viability is one of the important limitations, as it does
 not favor the maturation of the cells. As a result, the OVB organoids, at this stage of development, do
 not show mature retinal cell types and retina–cortex connectivity as seen in vivo. We still need to
 attempt to optimize the conditions that allow the generation of healthy organoids beyond 60 d of
 culture. However, the increased accessibility of this protocol may enable researchers to accelerate the

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 further development of strategies that can allow culturing them for a longer time. Another limitation
 in this methodology is its scalability to generate many organoids per batch. As most steps strictly
 require manual processing and culturing, there is a limitation on how many organoids one can
 generate per batch. Generation of ~40 OVB organoids per batch is realistic, and this is a sufﬁcient
 number for the analysis of three different timepoints, for example.
 OVB organoids generated with this protocol consistently developed OVs across iPSCs from several
 donors (‘Anticipated results’). We hope further optimizations and ﬁne tuning by a wide range
 of researchers can improve the proposed protocol’s robustness. Finally, due to a substantial portion of
 the brain tissue, the number of retinal and non-neuronal cell types covered for bulk or scRNA
 sequencing (scRNA-seq) is often limited. This poses a risk of using many organoids for sequencing
 purposes, which is not cost-effective. Otherwise, the results of correlating OVB organoids with
 the in vivo counterparts are not satisfactory. However, despite these limitations, we believe that the
 accessibility of the current protocol will develop measures to overcome the limitations described here.

 protocol. This can substantially affect the differentiation procedure. For example, suppose your iPSC
 culture does not display a typical morphology of homogeneous stem cell colonies but instead contains
 large, ﬂat cells or cells with neurites. In that case, this is a sign of differentiation under stem cell
 conditions. For ‘cleaning up’ in cases where there are up to 20% of differentiated cell areas, remove any
 differentiated cells from the dishes before passaging. If more than 20% of the cells are differentiated, we
 recommend manually picking the ‘good’ iPSC colonies and transferring them to new dishes.
