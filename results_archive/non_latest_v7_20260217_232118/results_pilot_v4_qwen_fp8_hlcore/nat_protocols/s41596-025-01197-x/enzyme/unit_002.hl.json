          "rationale": "During the early stages of human embryonic development (18–19 d post-conception), gastrulation results in the formation of three germ cell layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. As development progresses, ectodermal cells undergo extensive proliferation and form the neural plate (20–21 d post-conception), which is followed by the formation of neural folds (22–23 d post-conception) and then a singular neural tube (25–26 d post-conception). The wall of the neural tube comprises polarized and pseudostratified neuroepithelial cells that are the earliest neural progenitors in the developing human embryo. Proper neural tube formation is vital for normal embryonic development, as neural tube formation abnormalities are known to lead to different birth defects, such as anencephaly, spina bifida and encephalocele. Remarkably, neural tube-like structures, termed 'neural rosettes', can be spontaneously generated from PS cells in vitro during neural differentiation. We hypothesized that isolated SNRs could be used as a starting material for generating predictably organized brain organoids with a singular neural tube-like structure to mimic the natural development of neural tissue from the singular neural tube. Importantly, multiple rosette-like structures in neural tissue have been observed in association with brain tumors, which may affect neuronal differentiation, migration and maturation."

          "rationale": "Efficient neural induction of PS cells in vitro can be achieved through the use of dual-SMAD inhibition via co-application of a BMP–SMAD1/5/8 inhibitor, such as Noggin, LDN193189 or dorsomorphin, and an inhibitor of the TGF-β–activin–NODAL–SMAD2/3 signaling pathway, such as SB-431542. The dual-SMAD inhibitors induce the neuralization of ectodermal tissue while destabilizing the pluripotency gene expression networks and suppressing the induction of mesodermal fates in PS cells. Thus, we use the dual-SMAD inhibitors dorsomorphin (4 μM) and SB-431542 (10 μM) in neurobasal media with the vitamin A-containing B27 supplement for neural induction. Notably, no other organoid generation protocols use vitamin A-containing B27, as vitamin A is a precursor of retinoic acid, which is known to induce neural tissue caudalization. However, we detected no or few cells expressing caudal markers, such as EN1, FOXA2, GBX2, PAX2, and HOXA2 and HOXA1, in SNR-derived organoids grown in media with vitamin A-containing B27, suggesting that a higher concentration of retinoic acid is probably necessary to induce the caudalization of neural tissue. Our rationale for using vitamin A-containing B27 was to promote intermediate neural progenitor specification and corticogenesis."

          "rationale": "Another important distinction of our neural induction protocol is that we use no Wnt inhibitors. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for supporting neural progenitor proliferation and dorsal telencephalic patterning, while Wnt inhibitors are known to promote the ventralization of telencephalic tissue. We decided to rely on endogenous morphogens, such as BMP7 and Wnt antagonists SFRP1 and FRZB, which have been detected in SNR-derived organoids, to induce the default neurodevelopmental program for the specification of telencephalic cell fates. Finally, to stimulate the proliferation of newly differentiated neuroectodermal cells and facilitate their adoption of radial glial identity, we treat the cultures of neuroepithelial cells with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2, 10 ng/mL) and epidermal growth factor (EGF, 10 ng/mL). In our preliminary experiments, we noticed that cultures without FGF2 exhibit impaired NR formation, limited organoid growth and increased cell death. The emergence of neural rosettes is typically observed at 6–8 d post EGF/FGF2-treatment initiation."
