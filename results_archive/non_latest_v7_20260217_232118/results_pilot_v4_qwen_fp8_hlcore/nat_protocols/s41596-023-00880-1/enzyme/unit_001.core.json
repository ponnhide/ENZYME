However, in all instances, nephron patterning remains immature. The immaturity of the proximal tubule (PT) is particularly problematic given the unique role of this structure in nephron reabsorption and secretion, and thus overall kidney functionality. This immaturity critically limits the potential usefulness of kidney organoids for applications such as drug development and toxicology research, as well as studies of PT dysfunction and disease. In this Protocol, we describe in detail our recently published methodology for generating kidney organoids with enhanced PTs (PT-enhanced kidney organoids)."
