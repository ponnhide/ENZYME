Add 500 µl of collagenase (20 mg/ml stock, final concentration 1 mg/ml) and 10 µl of ROCK inhibitor (10 mM stock, final concentration 10 µM) to the 50-ml Falcon tube containing the minced tissue. Wrap the 50-ml Falcon tube with Paraﬁlm and place the tube at a slight angle (~15°) on top of an orbital shaker located inside a heated incubator oven at 37 °C. Set the orbital shaker at 140 r.p.m. and digest the tissue for 1–2 h.
