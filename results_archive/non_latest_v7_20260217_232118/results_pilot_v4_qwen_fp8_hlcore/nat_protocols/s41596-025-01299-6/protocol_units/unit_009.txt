Protocol


l-Cysteine (6 M stock in nuclease-free H2O). Dissolve 10.54 g of l-cysteine hydrochloride
monohydrate in 10 ml of fresh nuclease-free H2O to make a 6 M stock. To avoid freeze-thaw
cycles, make 0.5-ml aliquots and store at −20 °C for ≤6 months.

Medium preparations (for cell culture)
E8 medium. Prepare the medium as specified in the table below. Store the medium at 4 °C for
≤2 weeks. Allow the E8 medium to come to room temperature (20–25 °C) before use.

Composition Volume (500 ml total) (ml) Final concentration
E8 medium 490 –
E8 supplement 10 2% (vol/vol)


Neural differentiation medium (NM). Prepare the medium as specified in the table below. Store
the medium at 4 °C for ≤2 weeks. Warm NM in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min before use.
