Although it specifically focuses on interneuron development, the protocol studying interneuron generation can be adapted to studying various developmental processes, including corticogenesis, gliogenesis and cell-type specification in regions such as the striatum18, thalamus19 and cerebellum20. The protocol for studying interneuron migration into the dorsal forebrain may also be adapted to study integration of interneurons into circuits or the genetic regulation of the migration of other cell types. To adapt the protocol for alternative applications, reporter hiPS cell lines for the cell type of interest are needed. Experimental readouts should then be adapted to the biological process of interest."

Although this protocol focuses on neural organoids and assembloids derived from hiPS cells, it can be adapted for human embryonic stem cell–derived cultures. The use of neural organoids and assembloids derived from human cells captures the unique human context of disease21,22. This makes the protocol particularly powerful for studying the genetic basis of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, epilepsy and schizophrenia."

          "text": "Among existing approaches, pooled CRISPR screening with 2D hiPS23–25 cell–derived neuronal cells has been widely used because of their scalability and shorter differentiation time. This format is particularly useful for assessing basic cellular phenotypes such as viability and proliferation. These 2D cultures, however, often involve the direct conversion of hiPS cells into terminally differentiated cell types, which precludes the modeling of intermediate stages of development. In addition, these cultures are more homogeneous in terms of cell composition, limiting their use for studying cell-cell interactions, such as interneuron migration. Neural organoids and assembloids, on the other hand, are suitable for conducting research focused on investigating the complex developmental processes involving diverse cell-cell interaction."

This illustrates how a gene perturbation alters cellular identity, differentiation trajectories or gene regulatory networks. However, this strategy is technically demanding, requiring high-quality single-cell RNA sequencing data and sufficient coverage for each perturbation, and therefore limiting the throughput of the experiment."

First, the off-target effects of sgRNAs can result in unintended gene perturbations and confounding phenotypes. To minimize this, we recommend using multiple independent sgRNAs per gene and validating top candidate genes individually with orthogonal approaches."

Carefully validating the pluripotency and genome integrity of hiPS cell lines is essential27. Conducting screens across multiple hiPS cell lines can improve robustness. In addition, validating top candidates across multiple hiPS cell lines ensures broader relevance. Batch-to-batch variability in organoid cultures can also introduce technical noise; therefore, quality-control steps at multiple stages of differentiation and across biological replicates is essential."
