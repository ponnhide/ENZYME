Despite these challenges, this protocol provides a powerful tool for exploring complex neurodevelopmental processes in a human-relevant context."

Therefore, we maintained in culture the virus-infected hiPS cells (with sgRNA and Cas9 expression) for ~10 d to ensure gene editing. For experiments editing postmitotic cells, including neurons, it is crucial to validate Cas9 function in the cell type of interest."

In the protocol presented here, we focused on both interneuron generation and migration in the forebrain. To track interneurons, we engineered a hiPS cell line to stably express eGFP under the control of a previously validated Dlxi1/2b enhancer, which labels the medial ganglionic eminence–derived cell lineage5,17. Consequently, interneurons in the hSO were marked as Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+. For the interneuron generation screen, we assessed the relative enrichment of sgRNAs for each targeted gene by comparing sorted Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ and Dlxi1/2b::eGFP− populations in hSO. To minimize screen duration while still capturing lineage specification, we performed this comparison immediately after the patterning phase of hSO differentiation, when ~25% of the cells in the hSO should have acquired an interneuron identity (Fig. 3d,e)."
