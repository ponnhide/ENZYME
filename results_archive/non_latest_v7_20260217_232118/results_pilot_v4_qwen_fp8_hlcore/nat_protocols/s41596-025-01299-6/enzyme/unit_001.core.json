          "text": "Organoids and assembloids derived from human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells model various aspects of nervous system development and function and can be used to study neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. We developed human forebrain assembloids (hFA) by integrating human cortical organoids (hCO), representing the cerebral cortex, with human subpallial organoids (hSO), mimicking the ventral forebrain. This preparation mirrors the cellular behavior of neurons in the fetal forebrain. Using this system, we investigated Timothy syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the CaV1.2 calcium channel and discovered that interneurons in mutant assembloids exhibit abnormal migratory saltations. Further molecular analyses revealed the underlying mechanisms driving these migration defects. We also leveraged this platform to identify and test the efficacy of an antisense oligonucleotide designed to correct the aberrant exon usage caused by the mutation, successfully mitigating interneuron migration defects."

          "text": "Abnormalities in the development and function of cortical γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing interneurons are increasingly recognized as contributing factors to autism spectrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). This connection is supported by the high prevalence of seizures and epilepsy in individuals with autism spectrum disorder and by genetic studies that have identified numerous NDD-associated genes related to inhibitory signaling, including multiple γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subunits. Despite these findings, linking specific genetic mutations to distinct phases of the extended process of human forebrain development remains challenging."
