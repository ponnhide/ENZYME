1 Remove as much cell culture medium from the cultures as possible, taking care not to disturb the organoids.
2 Add 500 µl of pre-chilled Cell Recovery solution.
3 Pipette up and down gently by using wide-bore tips to carefully break up the Matrigel matrix without damaging the organoids and collect the
organoids into a 15-ml conical tube.
4 Incubate the cultures with Cell Recovery solution at 4 °C for 20 min.
5 Centrifuge the cultures at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C, remove the Cell Recovery solution and repeat steps 2–5.
6 Visualize the organoids under the microscope to conﬁrm that the Matrigel has been fully depolymerased and that organoids are ﬂoating free
from the Matrigel. If organoids appear free from the Matrigel, centrifuge the cultures at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C to separate the structures
from the solution. Remove the Cell Recovery solution.
7 Add 5 ml of cold DPBS to the tube and gently pipette up and down to wash the Matrigel from the organoids.
8 Spin down the conical tube at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C.
9 Gently aspirate the DPBS.
10 Wash a second time with 5 ml of DPBS and spin down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C.
11 After aspirating DPBS, ﬁx the organoids in 1 ml of 4% (wt/vol) PFA at 4 °C overnight.
12 Spin down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min. Remove the PFA solution and dispose of properly.
13 Treat the ﬁxed samples with 500 µl of 4% (wt/vol) PFA with 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 at room temperature for 15 min.
14 Spin down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min. Remove the PFA/Triton X-100 solution and dispose of properly.
15 Add 5 ml of DPBS to the tube to suspend, and spin down the conical tube at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C.
16 Gently aspirate the DPBS.
17 Wash a second time with 5 ml of DPBS, spin down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C and gently aspirate the DPBS.
18 Add 1 ml of permeabilization buffer (0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20/DPBS) to the tube and transfer the organoids in solution to a 1.5-ml centrifuge
tube. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature.
19 After gently removing the permeabilization buffer, add 1 ml of blocking buffer (1% (wt/vol) BSA and 0.3% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in DPBS) and
leave for 1 h at room temperature.
20 Prepare the primary antibody mixture in blocking buffer. Perform a spin-down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C and aspirate off the blocking
buffer. Add the primary antibody mixture and incubate overnight at 4 oC.
21 Aspirate the primary antibody mixture and perform three washes with 1 ml of DPBS, spinning down and aspirating the DPBS each time.
22 Prepare the secondary antibody mixture in blocking buffer. Add this mixture to the tube with the organoids and leave at room temperature for
2 h or overnight at 4 oC.
23 Wash three times with 1 ml of DPBS, spinning down and aspirating the PBS each time.
24 Add 50 μl of DPBS to each tube of organoids and transfer to one well of an IBIDI glass slide. Add one drop of DAPI mounting medium per well.
Gently tilt the slide side to side to mix the DAPI mixture.
