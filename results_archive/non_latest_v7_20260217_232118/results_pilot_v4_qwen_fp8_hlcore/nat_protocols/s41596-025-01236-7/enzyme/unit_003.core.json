          "text": "Alternative methods: Multiple protocols have described the generation of hPSC-derived iNPCs, transitioning sequentially through mesoderm, intermediate mesoderm and posterior intermediate mesoderm, recapitulating normal kidney organogenesis. However, in these protocols, these iNPCs are transient and are induced to undergo MET to generate nephron structures immediately after they are formed. Direct reprogramming (or trans-differentiation) from fibroblasts to nephron progenitor-like cells through the forced expression of NPC-specific transcription factors has also been reported. In addition, culture conditions have been described to expand hPSC-derived iNPCs for a short period of time (up to two passages, or 14 d). Compared to these alternative methods to produce nephron progenitor-like cells in vitro, the protocol described here can stably expand hPSC-derived iNPCs for several months with high purity (90–95% SIX2+) and retained nephrogenic potential, allowing scalable manufacturing of high-quality human iNPCs for regenerative medicine and other applications. Importantly, transcriptome analysis of the iNPCs cultured in hNPSR-v2 medium indicated better resemblance to primary human NPCs in vivo, as compared to the transient iNPCs generated from hPSC differentiation. Nephron organoids have been generated from hPSCs transitioning through the transient iNPCs. Compared to these hPSC-derived nephron organoids, cultured iNPC-derived nephron organoids show minimal off-target cell types and increased nephron maturity, such as the formation of COL4A3+/COL4A4+ mature podocytes. A recent publication used an improved iNPC specification step from the standard nephron organoid protocol and demonstrated significant enhancement of proximal tubule segmentation and maturity, which is consistent with our observation that NPCs with higher quality will be able to generate more mature nephrons."

          "text": "Application: The ability to manufacture near-pure human iNPCs presents an unprecedented opportunity to study human kidney development, disease and regeneration. We showed in a proof-of-concept genome-wide CRISPR screen in cultured mouse NPCs that candidate genes regulating NPC self-renewal can be unbiasedly identified, with implications in congenital kidney disease and Wilms tumor development. Similar genome-scale screening or omics approaches can be applied to in vitro accessible human iNPCs to understand human NPC biology. We showed that genome editing can be performed directly in iNPC lines, allowing rapid genetic modifications in iNPCs and assessment of their functional consequences in nephron organoids. As an example, we showed that polycystic kidney disease 2 gene-knockout (PKD2−/−) iNPCs are expandable and can reproducibly and highly efficiently generate cystic nephron organoids recapitulating the disease phenotype. By following a similar approach, other disease-related genetic modifications can be introduced to the iNPC lines to generate novel models of kidney diseases. We also showed that hNPSR-v2 medium was able to reprogram hPSC-derived podocytes or primary podocytes isolated from human fetal kidneys to an NPC-like state, revealing previously unknown podocyte plasticity. This in vitro model offers an opportunity to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying kidney cell plasticity in the future. Compared to hPSC-derived nephron organoids, podocytes generated from the iNPC-derived nephron organoids show higher expression of mature podocyte marker genes such as COL4A3 and COL4A4, offering a potential tool to model glomerular diseases that cannot be recapitulated with current podocyte models that do not express these genes. However, it is important to consider the following limitations before using this model to study glomerular diseases: (i) these iNPC-derived nephron organoids are not vascularized, preventing the modeling of glomerular filtration as in a perfused glomerulus in vivo; and (ii) whether specialized podocyte structures (e.g., slit diaphragm) are properly formed in this in vitro model remains to be determined."
