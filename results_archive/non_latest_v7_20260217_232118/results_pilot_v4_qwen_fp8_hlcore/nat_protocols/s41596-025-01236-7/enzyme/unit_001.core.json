          "description": "Nephrons are the functional units of the kidney. On average, 1 million nephrons are present in one human kidney. Each nephron consists of >30 different cell types that are spatially organized to perform its diverse kidney functions from glomerular filtration to tubular reabsorption and secretion. Six2+ nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) have a central role in kidney organogenesis: they self-renew and give rise to all the major nephron cell types. Over the past decade, kidney organoids have been developed from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) by recapitulating normal kidney organogenesis. To develop nephron organoids, hPSCs transition sequentially through mesoderm, intermediate mesoderm and posterior intermediate mesoderm to generate a transient hPSC-induced NPC (iNPC) population. These transient iNPCs then further develop into nephron cell types in the organoids. Those pioneering in vitro human kidney models have enhanced our understanding of human kidney development and disease mechanisms. Despite the progress, cellular immaturity and the presence of large numbers of off-target cell types in hPSC-derived kidney organoids have hindered the development of safe and effective kidney-replacement therapies and prevented the accurate modeling of kidney diseases, especially adult-onset diseases. In this protocol, we describe in detail our recently published methodologies for deriving long-term expandable human iNPC lines from hPSCs. These iNPC lines exhibit a stable cell-proliferation rate, retain NPC marker gene expression over long-term culture and can be directly used for the generation of nephron organoids, demonstrating minimal off-target cell types with enhanced organoid maturity."
