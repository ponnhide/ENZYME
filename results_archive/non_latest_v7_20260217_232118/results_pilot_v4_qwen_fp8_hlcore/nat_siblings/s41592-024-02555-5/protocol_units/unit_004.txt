The single-cell transcriptomics datasets generated from both mosaic and downstream multiplexed organoids at early, mid and late stages of differentiation (Fig. 1b) were demultiplexed using three different state-of-the-art algorithms available for genetic demultiplexing (demuxlet27, souporcell28, Vireo29).
