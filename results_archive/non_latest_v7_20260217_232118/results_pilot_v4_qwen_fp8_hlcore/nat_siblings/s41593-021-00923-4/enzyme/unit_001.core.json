Despite recent evidence of neurotoxicity induced by a similar astroglial phenotype with UPR activation52, and the well-described contribution of astrocytes to neuropathology in ALS or ALS/FTD13, the functional consequences of C9 ALI-CO astrocytes have yet to be explored. This is pertinent to our organoid model as the transcriptomic data also point to secondary reactive astroglial responses, which can be associated with protective effects. Thus, teasing apart the primary and secondary astrocyte pathology and their functional consequences on neurons through perturbation experiments in C9 ALI-COs would be a therapeutically relevant goal53."

This allowed us to specifically address initial astroglia- and neuron-dependent pathologies without immune or secondary inflammatory responses. However, supplementation of ALI-COs with microglia/allogeneic immune cells could address immune-related pathogenesis in ALS/FTD in the future55."

Sliced organoids provide an important advantage as two adjacent slices derived from the same organoid could serve as a control–treatment pair, increasing the confidence in analyzing drug-related effects. The slicing of organoids may improve nutrition, suppressing the necrotic core5 that often features in whole organoids. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the complete immersion of slices in the medium."
