For cytomix treatment, human recombinant TNFɑ (R&D Systems), IFNɣ (R&D systems), and IL-1β (PeproTech) were dissolved in organoid media (without EGF or Nicotinamide) for 8 hours, after which organoids were washed twice with Advanced DMEM/F12 and then replaced with organoid media. The low and high doses considered were 10 ng/mL TNFɑ, 10 ng/mL IFNɣ, 1 ng/mL IL1β and 50 ng/mL TNFɑ, 50 ng/mL IFNɣ, 5 ng/mL IL1β.
