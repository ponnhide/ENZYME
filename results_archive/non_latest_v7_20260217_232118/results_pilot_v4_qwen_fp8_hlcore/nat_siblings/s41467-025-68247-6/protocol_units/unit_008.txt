Experiments involving microwell plates utilized 500 µm Gri3D plates (SUN bioscience). Prior to organoid seeding, storage buffer was aspirated from each well and 150 µL of Advanced DMEM/F12 was added through the pipetting port. The plate was placed in the tissue culture incubator for at least 30 min. Organoids that had been maintained in Cultrex domes for at least 5 days after passaging were removed from the ECM following the passaging protocol as above, but dissociated for 12 min in Trypsin rather than 6, or until organoids were largely single cells. Trypsin was neutralized and organoids were washed as in the passaging protocol. Following the PBS wash, organoids were resuspended in organoid growth media without Nicotinamide: Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1X Pen-Strep, 10 mM HEPES, 1X GlutaMAX, 1X B-27 Supplement, 0.2 nM Wnt Surrogate protein, 5 nM Gastrin-1, 1.25mM N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine, 100 µg/mL Primocin, 500 nM A 83-01, 50 ng/mL recombinant human EGF, 100 ng/mL recombinant human Noggin, 250 ng/mL recombinant human R-spondin 3, 100 ng/mL recombinant human IGF1, 50 ng/mL recombinant human FGF2, and with 10 µM Y-27632. Dissociated organoids were then counted using a hemocytometer and seeded into the microwell plates at a density of 200 cells per microwell, in 50 µL of media per well. The plates were placed in the incubator for 30–60 min to allow the cells to settle, after which another 100 µL of media containing 2% Matrigel was added per well. It is critical that Matrigel is added to the media while cold.
