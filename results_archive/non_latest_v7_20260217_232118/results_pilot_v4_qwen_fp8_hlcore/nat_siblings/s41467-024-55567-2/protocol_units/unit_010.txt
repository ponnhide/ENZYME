To interfere with MBD3 expression, sgRNA sequences targeting MBD3 were cloned into SpCas9-equipped HP180 plasmids and electroporated into established LGR5-mNeonGreen reporter cells. Colonies from single cells were manually picked, expanded, and screened by Western blotting using an MBD3 antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz).
