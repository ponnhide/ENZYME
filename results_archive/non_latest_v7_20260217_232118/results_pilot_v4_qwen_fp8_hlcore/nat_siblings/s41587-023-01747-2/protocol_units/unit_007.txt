Focusing on segmented nuclei in an exemplary 39-week organoid section, variance analysis in the protein expression feature space and visualization in a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) embedding revealed eight molecularly distinct nuclei clusters (Supplementary Fig. 4d,e), and comparison of protein expression with single-cell transcriptomes14 enabled cell type assignment to each nuclei cluster (Fig. 1h,i and Supplementary Fig. 4e,f).
