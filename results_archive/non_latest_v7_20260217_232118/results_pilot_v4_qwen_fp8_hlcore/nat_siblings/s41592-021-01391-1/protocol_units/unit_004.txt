The important points are the implementation of Quake-style microvalves to facilitate flow control during operation; the development of a machine-vision-based approach utilizing subsequent image subtraction for blob detection; the induction of deterministic particle displacement patterns to move particles into the target region of interest with 95.9% of particles placed in a ~200-μm-wide region; and the precise pressurization of the dropleting valve to enable accurate control of droplet volume.
