For 10x Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell suspensions were loaded onto 10x Genomics Single Cell 3′ Chips along with the mastermix as per the manufacturer’s protocol (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/index/doc/technical-note-chromium-single-cell-3-v3-reagent-workflow-and-software-updates) for the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library to generate single cell gel beads in emulsion (GEMs, version 3 chemistry).
