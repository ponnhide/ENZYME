Fluorescent cells containing the reporter can be isolated using flow cytometry before being propagated or cryopreserved for later use. From these uniquely barcoded iPSCs, we initiate cerebral organoids using approximately 2,000 cells to record lineages during organoid development (Fig. 1b). At a time point of choice, doxycycline introduction into the medium induces Cas9 expression in organoid cells, followed by formation of Cas9–gRNA complexes, leading to double-stranded break formation at the targeted location in the fluorescent reporter region of the recorder.
