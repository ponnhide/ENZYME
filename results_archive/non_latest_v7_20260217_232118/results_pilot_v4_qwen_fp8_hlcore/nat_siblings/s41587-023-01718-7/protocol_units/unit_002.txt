To follow cell trajectories over time, we used CellRank47 to infer the terminal macrostates (myocytic, epicardial, endothelial and endodermal) and the probability of each cell to transition toward these states based on both pseudotime and RNA velocity information (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7a).
