Epithelial cells are classified into four main groups based on their marker expression: (1) SOX9 populations, enriched in the proliferative phase and expressing genes characteristic of rising estrogen levels (MMP7, ESR1); (2) ciliated cells (PIFO, TPPP3); (3) lumenal cells (LGR5); and (4) glandular cells (SCGB2A2) (Fig. 2b–d and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b).
