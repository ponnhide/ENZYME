To generate a cellular map of the human endometrium that accounts for the temporal and spatial changes across the menstrual cycle, uterine samples were analyzed by single-cell transcriptomics—single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)—alongside spatial transcriptomics methods (10x Genomics Visium slides and high-resolution microscopy) (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a).
