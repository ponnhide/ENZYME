With our integrative scRNA-seq maps, we can now resolve three clusters within the SOX9 population: (1) SOX9+LGR5+ cells, expressing KRT17 and WNT7A; (2) SOX9+LGR5− cells, expressing IHH; and (3) proliferative SOX9+ cells, including both LGR5+ and LGR5− cycling cells (that is, cells in G2M/S phase).
