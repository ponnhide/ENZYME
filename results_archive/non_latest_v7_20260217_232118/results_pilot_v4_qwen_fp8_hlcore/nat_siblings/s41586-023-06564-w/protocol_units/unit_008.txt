The next day (day 0), cellular aggregates were transferred into ultra-low attachment plastic dishes (Corning, catalogue no. 3262) and cultured in Essential 6 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. A1516401) supplemented with dorsomorphin (2.5 µM, Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. P5499), SB-431542 (10 µM, R&D Systems, catalogue no. 1614) and XAV-939 (1.25 µM, Tocris, catalogue no. 3748). No medium change was performed on day 1. Organoids were cultured in E6 medium with patterning molecules from days 2 to 5.
