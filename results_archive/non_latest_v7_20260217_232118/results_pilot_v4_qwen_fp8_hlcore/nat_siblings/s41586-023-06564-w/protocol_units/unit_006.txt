CAG::Cas9 hiPS cells cultured in a six-well plate were infected with lentivirus expressing Dlxi1/2b::eGFP with a hygromycin resistance gene. Cells were maintained in Essential 8 medium for another 3 days before passaging. One day after passaging, 200 µg ml−1 hygromycin was added to the medium to select for infected cells. Cells were maintained in hygromycin for 9 days.
