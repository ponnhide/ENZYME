H3K27ac CUT&Tag libraries were prepared as previously described60, with modifications. In brief, cells were dissociated from human developing cortical tissue as described above. Fifty thousand cell aliquots were reconstituted in neural induction medium at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 96-well v-bottom low-adhesion plates. Glasgow’s modified Eagle’s medium (GMEM)-based neural induction medium includes 20% Knockout Serum Replacer (KSR), 1× non-essential amino acids, 0.11 mg/ml sodium pyruvate, 1× penicillin-streptomycin, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5 μM SB431542 and 3 μM IWR1-endo. Medium was supplemented with 20 μM Rock inhibitor Y-27632 for the first 6 days. After 18 days, organoids were transferred from 96- to 6-well low-adhesion plates, moved to an orbital shaker rotating at 90 rpm, and changed to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12-based medium containing 1× glutamax, 1× N2, 1× B27 without vitamin A and 1× antibiotic–antimycotic (anti-anti). At 35 days, organoids were moved into DMEM/F12-based medium containing 1× N2, 1× B27 with vitamin A and 1× anti-anti. Throughout the culture duration, organoids were fed every other day.
