For instance, we developed human\nforebrain assembloids5 (hFA) by integrating human cortical organoids (hCO), representing\nthe cerebral cortex, with human subpallial organoids (hSO), mimicking the ventral forebrain\n(Fig. 1), which can be used to study cortical interneuron migration and circuit integration5–7. This\npreparation mirrors the cellular behavior of neurons in the fetal forebrain5,8. Using this system,\nwe investigated Timothy syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations\nin the CaV1.2 calcium channel and discovered that interneurons in mutant assembloids\nexhibit abnormal migratory saltations5. Further molecular analyses revealed the underlying\nmechanisms driving these migration defects8. Importantly, we also leveraged this platform to\nidentify and test the efficacy of an antisense oligonucleotide designed to correct the aberrant\nexon usage caused by the mutation, successfully mitigating interneuron migration defects9.\n\nDevelopment of the protocol\nAbnormalities in the development and function of cortical γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing\ninterneurons are increasingly recognized as contributing factors to autism spectrum disorder\nand other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs)10,11. This connection is supported by the high\nprevalence of seizures and epilepsy in individuals with autism spectrum disorder and by genetic\nstudies that have identified numerous NDD-associated genes related to inhibitory signaling,\nincluding multiple γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subunits12,13. Despite these findings, linking\nspecific genetic mutations to distinct phases of the extended process of human forebrain\ndevelopment remains challenging.\n Pooled CRISPR–Cas9 genetic screening provides a powerful, high-throughput\napproach to systematically study the functions of a group of genes in complex biological\nprocesses14,15. Although this approach has been applied with neural organoids to study early\nneural differentiation, its use in investigating more complex developmental events, such as\ninterneuron differentiation and migration, had not been demonstrated.

Specifically, we established a reporter hiPS cell line that\nlabels interneurons and applied it in both organoid and assembloid models. In organoids,\nwe assessed interneuron generation, and in assembloids, we assessed interneuron migration\ninto cortical circuits. By comparing sgRNA enrichment and depletion across interneuron\npopulations in these contexts, our analysis identified 46 genes (~11% of genes screened) that\nsignificantly disrupted interneuron development. We validated several of these hits and\nfound results consistent with the screen, demonstrating that significant sgRNA enrichment or\ndepletion can be reliably maintained long term in both organoid and assembloid models. These\nfindings underscore the utility of this CRISPR-assembloid platform in mapping NDD-associated\ngenes to specific developmental processes and uncovering the mechanisms of disease.\n Here, we present a detailed protocol for integrating pooled CRISPR–Cas9 screening with\nneural organoids and assembloids to study human interneuron generation (i.e., interneuron\ngeneration screen) and migration to the developing cortex (i.e., interneuron migration screen).\nThe protocol outlines key steps for applying CRISPR screening in 3D organoid cultures,\naddressing challenges such as culture variability and extended culture duration. In addition,\nthis protocol includes a practical workflow for generating knockout (KO) cell lines for screen\nhits, enabling downstream functional validations.\n\nOverview of the procedure\nOur protocol for pooled CRISPR screening in neural organoids and assembloids can be divided\ninto five sections (Fig. 2a,b). Section 1 begins with the transduction of hiPS cells by using\nlentivirus carrying sgRNAs, which also encodes mCherry to label infected cells, followed by\nthe maintenance of transduced hiPS cells to achieve gene perturbation. This is followed by\nsection 2, which describes the generation of hSO from genetically modified hiPS cells. We also\nprovide details on the generation of hCO for use in the migration screen. Section 3 describes\nsteps for isolating cells from parallel screens for interneuron generation and migration. This\ninvolves the use of engineered hiPS cells to stably express eGFP under the control of a previously\nvalidated Dlxi1/2b enhancer, which labels ganglionic eminence-derived cells5,17.

      "text": "Protocol\n\nApplications\nThis protocol combines pooled CRISPR KO screening with hiPS cell–derived neural organoids\nand assembloids to provide a versatile platform for investigating the genetic regulation of\nneural development. Although it specifically focuses on interneuron development, the protocol\nstudying interneuron generation can be adapted to studying various developmental processes,\nincluding corticogenesis, gliogenesis and cell-type specification in regions such as the\nstriatum18, thalamus19 and cerebellum20. The protocol for studying interneuron migration into\nthe dorsal forebrain may also be adapted to study integration of interneurons into circuits or\nthe genetic regulation of the migration of other cell types. To adapt the protocol for alternative\napplications, reporter hiPS cell lines for the cell type of interest are needed. Experimental\nreadouts should then be adapted to the biological process of interest.\n By targeting specific groups of genes or through unbiased genome-wide screens, this\napproach enables the systematic identification of key regulators involved in diverse biological\nprocesses. Although this protocol focuses on neural organoids and assembloids derived from\nhiPS cells, it can be adapted for human embryonic stem cell–derived cultures. The use of neural\norganoids and assembloids derived from human cells captures the unique human context of\ndisease21,22. This makes the protocol particularly powerful for studying the genetic basis of\nneurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, epilepsy and schizophrenia.\n\nComparison with other methods\nAmong existing approaches, pooled CRISPR screening with 2D hiPS23–25 cell–derived neuronal\ncells has been widely used because of their scalability and shorter differentiation time. This\nformat is particularly useful for assessing basic cellular phenotypes such as viability and\nproliferation. These 2D cultures, however, often involve the direct conversion of hiPS cells into\nterminally differentiated cell types, which precludes the modeling of intermediate stages of\ndevelopment. In addition, these cultures are more homogeneous in terms of cell composition,\nlimiting their use for studying cell-cell interactions, such as interneuron migration. Neural\norganoids and assembloids, on the other hand, are suitable for conducting research focused\non investigating the complex developmental processes involving diverse cell-cell interaction.\nThe combination of CRSIPR-based perturbation with single-cell RNA sequencing26 enables\nthe profiling of transcriptional consequences due to gene perturbation. This illustrates how\na gene perturbation alters cellular identity, differentiation trajectories or gene regulatory\nnetworks. However, this strategy is technically demanding, requiring high-quality single-cell\nRNA sequencing data and sufficient coverage for each perturbation, and therefore limiting\nthe throughput of the experiment. The approach that we present here relies on genomic DNA\nsequencing of bulk samples and therefore can be scaled up to genome-wide screening. In\naddition, coupling CRISPR screening with phenotypic assessments allows one to study specific\nbiological processes, which can be difficult to infer from RNA profiles alone.\n\nLimitations\nThere are a number of limitations to consider while designing and interpreting results from the\npooled CRISPR KO screen in human neural organoids and assembloids.\n First, the off-target effects of sgRNAs can result in unintended gene perturbations and\nconfounding phenotypes. To minimize this, we recommend using multiple independent\nsgRNAs per gene and validating top candidate genes individually with orthogonal approaches.\n Second, variability between hiPS cell lines and their insufficient benchmarking can\ninfluence differentiation potential, gene expression profiles, and responses to genetic\nperturbations, thereby affecting the reproducibility and generalizability of the screen. Carefully\nvalidating the pluripotency and genome integrity of hiPS cell lines is essential27. Conducting\nscreens across multiple hiPS cell lines can improve robustness. In addition, validating top\ncandidates across multiple hiPS cell lines ensures broader relevance. Batch-to-batch variability\nin organoid cultures can also introduce technical noise; therefore, quality-control steps at\nmultiple stages of differentiation and across biological replicates is essential.\n Third, the heterogeneous nature of gene disruption in pooled CRISPR screens can\ncomplicate genotype-phenotype correlations. Editing outcomes may range from homozygous",

Follow-up validation using\nisogenic homozygous or heterozygous KO lines is critical for clarifying the effect of complete or\npartial loss of the candidate genes.\n Moreover, organoids, despite mimicking many aspects of the developing brain, lack\nvascularization and cross-talk between brain regions28. Assembloid generation is laborious,\nlimiting some readouts and large-scale studies. Moreover, these studies are long, often\nrequiring >10 weeks of in vitro differentiation. Despite these challenges, this protocol provides\na powerful tool for exploring complex neurodevelopmental processes in a human-relevant\ncontext.\n\nExperimental design\nValidation of Cas9 expression\nIn this protocol, we use a hiPS cell line that stably expresses Cas9 under a Tet-off system, for\nwhich we validated gene-editing efficiency by using a GFP self-cutting assay16. We and others\nhave observed that Cas9 function may vary in postmitotic cells29. Therefore, we maintained in\nculture the virus-infected hiPS cells (with sgRNA and Cas9 expression) for ~10 d to ensure gene\nediting. For experiments editing postmitotic cells, including neurons, it is crucial to validate\nCas9 function in the cell type of interest.\n\nDesigning the readout of the screen\nA critical aspect of CRISPR screening is determining the readout of the screen and the time\npoint to perform the experimental readout for the phenotype or biological process being\nstudied. In the protocol presented here, we focused on both interneuron generation and\nmigration in the forebrain. To track interneurons, we engineered a hiPS cell line to stably\nexpress eGFP under the control of a previously validated Dlxi1/2b enhancer, which labels\nthe medial ganglionic eminence–derived cell lineage5,17. Consequently, interneurons in the\nhSO were marked as Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+. For the interneuron generation screen, we assessed the\nrelative enrichment of sgRNAs for each targeted gene by comparing sorted Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+\nand Dlxi1/2b::eGFP− populations in hSO. To minimize screen duration while still capturing\nlineage specification, we performed this comparison immediately after the patterning phase\nof hSO differentiation, when ~25% of the cells in the hSO should have acquired an interneuron\nidentity (Fig. 3d,e). For the interneuron migration screen, we evaluated the relative enrichment\nof sgRNAs for each targeted gene in migrated and non-migrated Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells in hFA.\nOn the basis of our empirical observations, we conducted this comparison on samples that\nwere collected 30 d after assembly to ensure enough migrated interneurons for downstream\nanalysis.\n\nLibrary representation\nMaintaining sufficient library representation is essential for ensuring the reproducibility\nof a pooled CRISPR screen30, especially considering inter-hiPS cell line variability for neural\norganoid generation31. In practice, the actual library representation for a given screen may be\nlower than theoretically calculated, particularly in long-term cultures that model dynamic\ndevelopmental processes. When resources permit, increasing library representation can help\nmitigate these challenges and improve the robustness of the screen.\n\nMinimization of organoid fusion\nDuring neural induction, differentiation and patterning, neural organoids tend to fuse with\neach other32. To improve culture quality, we routinely separate fused organoids33, or one can\nincorporate xanthan gum polymers to avoid fusion34. Large organoid clusters can impede\ncellular growth and result in unwanted cell death.\n\nMinimization of cell death during dissociation\nHarsh dissociation of organoids and assembloids can induce cell death, especially in long-term\ncultures. To minimize this, we optimized papain concentration and incubation time on the basis",
