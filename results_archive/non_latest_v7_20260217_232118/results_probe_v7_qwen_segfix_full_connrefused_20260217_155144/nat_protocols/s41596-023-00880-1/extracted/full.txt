Protocol


Introduction

Several protocols have been established for the directed differentiation of human pluripotent
stem cells (hPSCs) to kidney tissue, generating organoids with segmented nephrons surrounded
by stroma and endothelium1–5. However, in all instances, nephron patterning remains immature.
The immaturity of the proximal tubule (PT) is particularly problematic given the unique role of
this structure in nephron reabsorption and secretion, and thus overall kidney functionality. This
immaturity critically limits the potential usefulness of kidney organoids for applications such as
drug development and toxicology research, as well as studies of PT dysfunction and disease. In
this Protocol, we describe in detail our recently published methodology for generating kidney
organoids with enhanced PTs (PT-enhanced kidney organoids)6.

Development of the protocol
The PT-enhanced organoid protocol builds on our earlier methods for generating hPSC-derived
kidney organoids, which have transitioned from hPSC maintenance using mouse embryonic
feeder layers to the use of feeder-free hPSC culture conditions, utilizing either APEL or
TeSR-E6 medium to support subsequent differentiation4,7–10. However, there are several
differences between these original methods and the PT-enhanced organoid protocol with
respect to the duration of the metanephric nephron progenitor specification phase and the
maintenance of this population before three-dimensional (3D) micromass generation6. While
our original Takasato protocol generates 3D kidney organoids from an intermediate mesoderm
population at day 7 of monolayer differentiation, prolonged differentiation and suppression of
precocious epithelialization in the current protocol favors improved metanephric progenitor
identity and proximal patterning of the resulting organoids.
 The PT-enhanced kidney organoid protocol possesses specific adaptions to the stepwise
differentiation phases to primitive streak and intermediate mesoderm that influence the
resulting metanephric identity of the progenitors. In the initial stages of the PT-enhanced
protocol, similar to the Takasato method9,10, hPSCs—embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)—cultured in two-dimensional monolayer conditions of carefully
controlled cell density are initially induced with canonical WNT signaling to form primitive
streak. To encourage a metanephric identity, posteriorization of the primitive streak is
promoted by prolonging the duration of canonical WNT induction to 5 d before the addition
of FGF9, known to encourage robust posterior intermediate mesoderm formation3,4,9 (Fig. 1a).
The subsequent monolayer differentiation phase is then extended beyond day 10 (with
day 13 determined to be optimal6) with the introduction of nephron progenitor supportive
medium (CDBLY2; modified from CDBLY11) to better emulate the complex morphogen signaling
environment and timing of metanephric kidney development12–16, as well as the appearance of
SIX2-expressing progenitors during kidney organoid differentiation7.
 The provision of CDBLY2 at day 8 of monolayer differentiation prolongs FGF9 exposure
while simultaneously maintaining low-level canonical WNT, BMP and NOTCH signaling to
support nephron progenitor self-renewal11,17–20, assisting nephron progenitor commitment,
nephron patterning and maturation21–23. As a result, CDBLY2 not only supports and expands
the progenitors, but also prevents spontaneous epithelialization of the monolayer, prolonging
the progenitor specification phase of the differentiation compared with standard organoid
protocols6.
 Monolayer cells are aggregated on day 13 of differentiation, when the culture contains
predominantly committed and primed progenitors, intermediate mesoderm and metanephric
mesenchyme6, and transferred to a Transwell membrane for air–medium interface culture
in a 3D format (Fig. 1a,b). Following 14 d of culture in TesR-E6 basal medium, with an initial
5 d exposure to FGF9, the resulting PT-enhanced organoids possess more mature PTs
compared with those derived from a range of standard organoid protocols, with improved
transporter expression and evidence of S1/S2/S3 PT segmentation. The higher levels of
nephron functionality also translate to a more detectable PT damage response following
nephrotoxic insult and an improved ability to model severe acute respiratory syndrome

coronavirus 2 infection6. Another unique feature of PT-enhanced organoids is their nephron
spatial organization. This arises from a centralized WNT signaling gradient originating from
the organoids’ dense core of cortical stroma and pre-cartilage cells, producing elongated and
aligned nephrons that radiate outward from a central ring of glomeruli6.

Alternative methods
The critical role of the PT in renal function and its vulnerability to nephrotoxic insult has
led to a wide range of approaches to generate in vitro PT models. Originally focussing on
the development of primary and immortalized adult PT cell lines, such as HK-2 (ref. 24),
HKC11/HKC8 (ref. 25), HPTC-05-CLA (ref. 26) and PTEC-TERT1 (ref. 27), more recent studies
have generated PT-like populations via transcriptional reprogramming of fibroblasts and
hiPSC-directed differentiation28–31. However, two-dimensional static cultures of such PT cells
face limitations including de-differentiation, low transporter expression levels and loss of their
polarized columnar cell morphology25,32–34. To better recapitulate physiological PT conditions,
apical sheer stress has been applied to adult PT cell monolayers35–38, while other approaches
have applied 3D culture techniques to promote tubule formation (with or without flow) using
PT cell lines, isolated adult kidney tubule cells and iPSC/kidney organoid-derived PT cells39–45.
These studies have reported similar improvements in the functional expression of some apical/
basolateral transporters, tight junction formation, selective substrate uptake and improved
nephrotoxic response compared with PT lines under static conditions. However, compared with
human PT in vivo, PT identity in vitro remains suboptimal, showing low or absent expression
of several critical transporters, heterogeneous expression of markers from other nephron
segments, or incomplete recapitulation of PT cell populations for the three PT segments
(S1–S3). Furthermore, techniques and culture formats used to improve PT cell identity can

Protocol


require complicated cell isolation, seeding and bioprinting processes, while facing challenges
for accurately recapitulating PT physical characteristics such as lumen diameter and interaction
with supportive cell types.
 A potential way to overcome these limitations is to exploit the existing finely tuned
capacity of hPSCs to be directly differentiated into multicellular tissues that anatomically
resemble their in vivo counterparts. The generation of hPSC-derived kidney organoids is now
a well-established methodology, capable of developing segmented nephrons with evidence
of proximal, distal, stromal and endothelial elements1,2,8,9,46–48. However, standard kidney
organoids model the developing kidney, displaying PT immaturity at both a phenotypic
and functional level6,49,50. In this Protocol, we describe a unique methodology to generate
intact proximalized nephrons in an organoid format, together with cortical stroma, loop of
Henle and endothelial populations. Although less mature than fully differentiated adult PTs
in vivo, PT-enhanced organoids display superior PT maturation compared with standard
organoids derived from a range of protocols, with evidence of S1/S2/S3 PT cell types, improved
functionality and suitability as a model of PT damage and disease.

Applications and limitations
PT-enhanced organoids represent a powerful model for a range of applications, such as
screening of drugs for nephrotoxic side effects, pharmaceutical efficacy testing, discovery
of novel treatments for proximal tubular diseases, modeling of inherited or acquired
diseases with a proximal tubular dysfunction phenotype, kidney developmental studies,
and bioengineering approaches to disease treatment. However, PT-enhanced organoids face
some limitations that are similarly shared with existing standard organoids. Overall immaturity
and inability to culture kidney organoids long term to achieve structural and functional
maturation are currently key limitations of the model. Despite displaying improved maturity,
some important transporters show low expression levels in PT-enhanced organoids, such as
SLC22A2/OCT2 and SLC22A6/OAT1, highlighting the need for ongoing culture optimization.
Differentiation toward off-target cell types is also recurrent in standard and PT-enhanced
kidney organoids. A diverse range of non-kidney cell types arise during hPSC differentiation to
kidney organoids, such as neural, muscle and cartilage lineages50–52. In PT-enhanced organoids,
the characteristic spatially arranged and proximalized nephrons arise from a self-established
centralized core of WNT antagonism, which possesses a pre-cartilage population in addition
to cortical stroma6. Such off-target populations are likely to be problematic for translation
of this protocol to clinical applications and it is currently unknown whether the organoid
cell endpoints would be different overall if the nephron progenitor specification steps
described here were to be incorporated into other kidney organoid protocols. Finally, while
proximalized nephrons of improved maturity will be of great benefit for a range of disease
research applications, they may not be suitable for approaches requiring the presence of more
distal nephron segments beyond the loop of Henle. PT-enhanced organoids possess little
GATA3 expression, suggesting limited patterning to distal connecting segment6. The current
inability to simultaneously generate all kidney cell populations in a single differentiation step
remains a challenge within the kidney organoid field as a whole and further limits nephron
development1,2,5,48,49. Critical interactions between cell populations such as ureteric bud or
nephron progenitors and stroma compartments or the developing nephron53–55 are lacking
in the organoid environment, thus impacting correct nephron patterning, structure and
elongation.

Experimental design
hPSC passaging and expansion in preparation for differentiation
This protocol has been successfully applied to a range of human iPSCs6, as well as human ESCs
(unpublished). The current protocol depicts results generated using two iPSC lines (detailed in
‘Reagents’), cultured feeder free in TesR-Essential 8(E8) medium with the support of Matrigel
(Steps 1–9). Passaging is performed at 80% confluency, 2 d before (day −2) differentiation
induction, at a 1:3 split ratio to ensure adequate numbers of cells in the exponential growth
phase before seeding (Fig. 2).

Nature Protocols | Volume 18 | November 2023 | 3229–3252 3232

Protocol


Seeding and attachment of hPSCs for differentiation
Accurate and consistent seeding density are important to differentiation outcome and
reproducibility of the PT-enhanced organoid protocol. The iPSCs are consistently seeded for
differentiation onto Laminin-coated 12-well plates 2 d post-passaging, at which time the iPSC
culture has reached ~80% confluency, at a density of 25,000 cells per well (Steps 10–24). The
number of wells is calculated at Step 10 to ensure adequate organoids for control and test
conditions in downstream analyses (Steps 54–91), including functional assays (PT-specific
uptake of fluorescently labeled substrates) and immunofluorescence.

Differentiation of iPSCs to metanephric mesenchyme and PT-enhanced organoid
generation
Amongst other differences, the monolayer differentiation stage of this protocol has been
prolonged compared with our previous methodology9,10, with organoid generation occurring
at day 13 (Step 31), and utilises both TeSR-E6 and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium/Nutrient
Mixture F12 (DMEM/F12) basal medium. Differentiation is commenced 24 h post-seeding
by exposing the iPSCs to TeSR-E6 containing 6 µM CHIR99021 followed by 200 ng/mL FGF9
for 5 and 2 d, respectively, inducing posterior intermediate mesoderm and metanephric
mesenchyme (Steps 25–28). Further specification and support of the metanephric mesenchyme
population occurs from day 8 to 13 of differentiation (Step 29) through the addition of nephron
progenitor maintenance medium, adapted from a previous method11 to increase BMP7
levels6. Organoids are generated at day 13 of differentiation using our standard centrifugation
technique9 with TesR-E6 medium10 and are cultured for 14 d (day 27, representing the D13 + 14
timepoint in the original research related to this manuscript6) before collection (Figs. 1 and 2).
While the organoids may be suitable for functional and protein expression analyses described
below at earlier or later timepoints, day 27 is the most frequently assessed timepoint in our
laboratory, maximizing the maturation time before off-target populations such as cartilage are
visible by brightfield microscopy.

Functional and protein expression analyses of developed PT-enhanced organoids
To establish organoid patterning and maturity, a portion of the organoids are fixed at
Step 53, 14 d post-aggregation (day 27; representing the D13 + 14 timepoint6), for subsequent
immunofluorescence of PT-specific markers (Steps 74–91), while the remaining organoids
are used for fluorescent substrate uptake assays (Steps 54–73). The albumin uptake assay,
using tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated albumin to measure megalin–cubilin
activity56, is commenced first to account for its longer duration. During the incubation
step with TRITC–albumin, it is possible to complete the assay for PT-specific organic cation
transport via Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion Protein 1/2 (MATE-1/MATE-2), which utilizes DAPI
as a surrogate substrate57. Imaging of the live organoids from both functional assays, as well
as the fixed organoids following immunofluorescence, are performed using laser scanning
confocal microscopy (Steps 61, 73 and 91). The resulting PT-enhanced organoids are considered
successfully patterned based on the presence of radiating nephrons that take up fluorescently
labeled albumin and DAPI (Fig. 3), express PT-specific proteins (Fig. 4) and bind Lotus
tetragonobulus lectin (LTL) on their apical membrane (Fig. 4).

Resuspend lyophilized BMP7 (10 µg) in 100 µL of 0.1% human serum albumin containing 4 mM
HCl to make a stock solution of 100 µg/mL. Dispense as 5 µL aliquots into microcentrifuge tubes
and store at −80 °C for up to 6 months.

CHIR99021 (10 mM stock)
Centrifuge the tube of CHIR99021 at 1,000–3,000g for 10 s at room temperature (15–25 °C)

microcentrifuge tubes and store at −20 °C for up to 12 months.

CDBLY2
Referring to Table 3, calculate the total volume of CDBLY2 required for the experiment and for
each of the five medium changes (daily from D8 to D12 of differentiation), allowing 1 mL per well
of a 12-well plate and an additional 0.5–1 mL medium for pipetting errors. Collect and thaw all
required reagents detailed in Table 3 on ice. Working on ice in a biological safety cabinet, make
up the total volume of CDBLY2 medium required for the entire experiment in a 50 mL Falcon
tube, adding the exact volume of each reagent to cold media. Invert the tube to mix, then aliquot
into five individual conical tubes for each medium change and refrigerate. Before each medium
change, warm the tube to room temperature. See Troubleshooting section.

iPSCs in culture
Commence the protocol with a minimum of one well of 80% confluent iPSCs (~5–6 ×105 cells),
cultured in E8 medium within a Matrigel-coated six-well plate. The iPSCs can be maintained in
culture with daily refreshing of E8 medium (2 mL per well) and passaging once the cells reach
80% confluency (every 2–3 d) at a 1:6 split ratio for expansion (Fig. 2a), or 1:3 ratio at D2 before
seeding at Step 6 (Fig. 2b).
▲ CRITICAL We have experienced reduced reproducibility of the protocol when hPSCs are
obtained from cultures that have been highly manipulated, poorly maintained, contain high
levels of spontaneous differentiation or have been continuously cultured for long periods of
time (~40 passages and beyond). For optimal results, we suggest performing this protocol with
hPSCs maintained according to Steps 1–9 that have been derived from low passage frozen stocks
to enable seeding for differentiation before the cells have undergone 30 passages (inclusive of
passaging pre- and post-thaw) (Fig. 2a,b). Patches of spontaneous differentiation either outside
or within hPSC colonies (Fig. 2c, top) should be removed via aspiration with a glass pipette and

12 months.

Laminin-521-coated 12-well tissue culture plate for differentiation
For calculations related to well number determination, refer to Step 10 of the Procedure. For
each well of a 12-well plate required, add 20 µL of Laminin-521 to 1 mL of cold DMEM/F12. Pipette
to mix and dispense 1 mL per well. Seal the plate with parafilm and store overnight at 4 °C for
optimal coating. Warm to 37 °C in a CO2 incubator before dissociating and seeding of hPSCs
(Steps 10–24).
▲ CRITICAL While coated plates may be stored for 1 week at 4 °C, note that coating
efficiency will decrease over time. Problematic or sensitive cell lines may also require
higher concentrations of laminin-521. See the ‘Troubleshooting’ section.

LIF (100 µg/mL)
Resuspend lyophilized LIF (10 µg) in 100 µL of 0.1% (vol/vol) human serum albumin in ultrapure

storage at −80 °C for up to 6 months.

Matrigel stock
Thaw Matrigel overnight at 4 °C. Using prechilled sterile pipette tips and prechilled tubes,
aliquot 500 µL into each microcentrifuge tube and store at −20 °C.

Matrigel-coated six-well plate for iPSC maintenance
Thaw the Matrigel stock tube on ice. For each well of a six-well plate, prepare 1 mL of Matrigel
medium solution by adding 6 µL of Matrigel stock to 1 mL of cold DMEM/F12 using a prechilled
pipette tip. Mix and dispense 1 mL of Matrigel medium solution per well of a six-well plate
using a prechilled serological pipette. Incubate the six-well plate in the 37 °C incubator for at
least 30 min before cell seeding. Matrigel-coated plates can be stored within the CO2 incubator
or refrigerated for up to 2 weeks. Before cell seeding, aspirate residual Matrigel/DMEM/F12
solution and immediately replace with 2 mL E8 per well. Unused thawed Matrigel can be stored
on ice for up to 2 weeks at 4 °C.

Procedure

hPSC passaging and expansion in preparation for differentiation
● TIMING 2 d
1. Day −3: prepare two or three Matrigel-coated wells in a six-well plate before passaging and
 warm to 37 °C in the CO2 incubator (see ‘Reagent setup’).
2. Aspirate E8 medium from the well of 80% confluent hPSCs and wash the cells once with 1 mL
 of room temperature 0.5 mM EDTA to remove detached cells.

Nature Protocols | Volume 18 | November 2023 | 3229–3252 3241

Protocol


 ▲ CRITICAL STEP hPSC quality is important to the experimental outcome. Refer to the
 ‘Reagent setup’ above and Table 4 for additional information regarding hPSC maintenance.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
3. Add 1 mL of fresh room temperature EDTA to the well and incubate for 3 min, visualizing the
 cells at 2.5 min for cell rounding at the edge of all colonies, with some rounding beginning to
 appear in the center.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Larger colonies may require longer incubation times. Typically, 3 min is
 sufficient. Do not exceed 5 min as this can be detrimental to cell viability.
4. While incubating, remove the Matrigel-coated plate from the CO2 incubator, aspirate
 Matrigel solution from the wells and replace with 2 mL of room temperature E8.
5. After 3 min, aspirate the EDTA from the cells and dispense 1.5 mL of E8 directly onto the well
 to detach the cells from the plate. Re-aspirate the medium containing the detached cells,
 then use this to wash the well gently once more to dislodge additional remaining cells and
 dissociate the colonies to medium-sized cell clusters (Fig. 2a).
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Pipetting more than three times or using excessive force can be
 detrimental to hPSC health and thus the experimental outcome. Cells should ideally remain
 in medium-sized clusters (Fig. 2a, top) while passaging for maintenance purposes to
 encourage appropriately sized colonies.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
6. Re-aspirate medium with cells and add 0.5 mL per well (1:3 split ratio) dropwise to the new
 Matrigel-coated plate containing 2 mL of E8 per well (plate prepared in Step 4).
7. Place the plate in the CO2 incubator and distribute cells by moving plate in a left-to-right
 motion followed by a backward–forward motion three times in both directions. Incubate
 overnight.
8. Day −2: inspect the hPSCs using a light microscope to check there are colonies attached to
 the plate. Replace the medium with fresh room temperature E8.
9. Day −1: inspect the hPSCs using a light microscope to check the colonies have expanded
 since day −2 to be considered in the exponential growth phase, as required for seeding for
 differentiation.

Seeding and attachment of hPSCs for differentiation
● TIMING 2 d
10. Day −1: prepare a Laminin-521-coated 12-well plate before passaging and warm to 37 °C in the
 CO2 incubator (see ‘Reagent setup’). Determine the number of wells to be seeded according
 to the number of organoids required. The PT-enhanced protocol typically generates
 5 × 106 cells/well of a 12-well plate after 13 d of differentiation. The procedure shown here
 generates 45 organoids, enabling assays for albumin uptake and organic cation transport
 to be performed, as well as immunofluorescence of PT markers. For the generation of
 45 organoids of 250,000 cells each, 11.25 × 106 cells are required. Therefore, we recommend
 preparing four Laminin-521-coated wells for hPSC differentiation (minimum three wells).
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
11. Aspirate E8 from hPSCs, wash well with 1 mL of room temperature TrypLE Select, then
 aspirate and replace with a fresh 1mL of TrypLE Select.
12. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 3 min, monitoring for rounding of the cells
 (Step 3).
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP The cells should remain loosely attached to the plate, indicating a
 sufficient length of TryPLE Select exposure while minimizing the chance of excessive
 dissociation.
13. While incubating, dispense 3 mL of room temperature E8 into a 15 mL conical tube.
14. Following incubation, use a P1000 pipette to gently pipette the cells up and down three
 times to dissociate them into small clusters.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP When pipetting, three times is sufficient to dissociate the cells into small
 clusters appropriate for cell counting at Step 19. Pipetting excessively (more than five times)
 is detrimental to cell health and experimental outcome.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING

Nature Protocols | Volume 18 | November 2023 | 3229–3252 3242

Protocol


15. Transfer the dissociated cells in TrypLE Select into the 15 mL conical tube containing 3 mL of E8.
16. Wash the well with a further 1 mL of E8 to collect any remaining cells and add to the conical
 tube.
17. Centrifuge the conical tube containing dissociated hPSCs at 300g for 3 min.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP For more sensitive hPSC lines, it may be necessary to omit this
 centrifugation step and proceed with cell counting and seeding steps below to avoid a
 large amount of cell death affecting differentiation efficiency.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
18. Aspirate the supernatant, gently flick the tube three times to dislodge pelleted cells, and
 resuspend in 0.5–0.8 mL of E8 with minimal gentle pipetting.
19. Transfer the suspension of small cell clusters to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, invert three
 or four times to evenly distribute cells and immediately remove 10 µL for cell counting using
 a hemocytometer.
20. After determining cell density, prepare a cell seeding mastermix in a conical tube according
 to the number of Laminin-521-coated wells to be seeded for differentiation, allowing for
 25,000 cells/well and 1 mL/well medium volume (plus one additional well for pipetting
 error).
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP For more sensitive hPSC lines that undergo a substantial amount of death
 after seeding, it may be necessary to increase the cell seeding number per well to obtain
 equivalent seeding density as a resilient line seeded at 25,000 cells/well. Variations in cell
 density result influence the differentiation outcome.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
 Example calculations:
 Cell suspension density = 1 × 106 cells/mL
 Cells to be seeded per well = 25,000 cells
 Number of wells to be seeded = 4 wells (+1 well extra for error = 5 wells)
 Total number of cells needed = 25,000 cells × 5 wells = 125,000 cells
 Volume of cell suspension required = 125,000/1 ×106 = 125 µL
 Final seeding mastermix = 125 µL cells in 5 mL E8 medium
21. Remove the Laminin-521-coated 12-well plate from the incubator and aspirate the coating
 medium from the wells that are to be seeded.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Work with three or four wells at a time. It is important that the wells do not
 dry as this will inactivate the Laminin-521 coating.
22. Invert the seeding mastermix three or four times immediately before seeding and dispense
 1 mL of mastermix per well.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Avoid further pipetting of the cells to maintain optimal cell health.
23. Once all wells are seeded, return the plate to the 37 °C CO2 incubator and evenly
 distribute the cells by moving the plate in a left–right then backward–forward motion
 at least three times.

Differentiation of hPSCs to metanephric mesenchyme
● TIMING 13 d
24. Day 0: following 24 h of incubation, check the cells are ready to commence differentiation
 (D0). Inspect the hPSCs using a light microscope to ensure that the cells are adhered,
 appear healthy without spontaneous differentiation and are of appropriate density
 (Fig. 2a,b).
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Suboptimal cell densities will affect the efficiency and specificity
 of differentiation to metanephric mesenchyme, and thus organoid patterning. If cell
 density appears suboptimal, do not postpone the commencement of differentiation by
 an additional day. Instead, either discard the plate and repeat the seeding steps above or
 proceed with the differentiation regardless.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
25. To commence the differentiation, aspirate the E8 and replace with 1 mL/well of E6 medium
 containing 6 µM CHIR99021 warmed to room temperature.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING

Nature Protocols | Volume 18 | November 2023 | 3229–3252 3243

Protocol


26. Place hPSCs back in the CO2 incubator and culture for a further 5 d, refreshing the E6/6µM
 CHIR99021 medium every 2 d (1 mL/well).
27. Day 5: change the culture medium to E6-containing 200 ng/mL FGF9 and 1 µg/mL heparin
 (1mL/well), refreshing this medium every 2 d for a further 3 d (to D8 differentiation).
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
28. Day 8: change the culture medium to CDBLY2 (1 mL per well), refreshing this medium daily
 for a further 5 d (to D13 differentiation) and monitoring the monolayer daily to ensure that
 there is no epithelialization of the culture (Fig. 2c, bottom).
 ▲ CRITICAL Daily refreshing with precisely 1 mL of CDBLY2 are critical parameters.
 Variations in this timing or volume can be detrimental to organoid patterning. Owing
 to the high number of growth factors within CDBLY2, warm only the required volume of
 medium to room temperature before addition to the cells and be mindful of growth factor
 expiration dates stated by the manufacturers. Discontinue the experiment if spontaneous
 epithelialization of the monolayer occurs (Fig. 2c, bottom).
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING

PT-enhanced kidney organoid generation and patterning
● TIMING 14 d
29. Day 13: on day 13 of monolayer differentiation, label the required number of six-well
 Transwell plates for organoid generation. If performing PT functionality assays and
 immunofluorescence outlined below, 2.5 Transwell plates will be required.
30. Aspirate the CDBLY2 medium from each well of differentiated hPSC, wash with 1 mL/well
 of room temperature TrypLE Select, then aspirate and replace with a fresh 1 mL of TrypLE
 Select.
31. Incubate plate at 37 °C for 3 min.
32. While the cells are incubating, place 1 mL of room temperature E6 containing 2% FBS into
 a 15 mL conical tube (one tube for every three or four wells of a 12-well plate).
33. Gently detach the cells from the well surface by pipetting up and down a maximum of six
 times using a P1000 pipette, dissociating to a single-cell suspension.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP If the differentiation has progressed correctly, the cells should detach
 easily. If the cells remain firmly attached to the well, return the plate to the CO2 incubator
 and incubate for a further 1 min in the existing TrypLE Select. Be aware that cell health will be
 compromised with longer incubation times and extensive trituration.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
34. Transfer the cells in TrypLE Select to the 15 mL conical tube containing E6/2% FBS.
35. Rinse the wells with an additional 1 mL of E6/2% FBS to collect any residual cells and add to
 the same conical tube.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Ensure that the steps from here to the completion of organoid plating
 are completed without any delays. Progressing through these steps too slowly will
 affect the patterning of the resulting organoids by compromising the viability of the
 dissociated cells.
36. Top-up the conical tube volume to 5 mL with E6/2% FBS and centrifuge the tube at 300g for
 3 min.
37. Aspirate the supernatant and gently flick the tube three times to dislodge the cell pellet.
38. Resuspend the cell pellet to a final volume of 2 mL of E6/2% FBS final volume, adding the
 medium gradually with a P1000 pipette and gently triturating the pellet during medium
 addition to resuspend to a single-cell suspension using minimal pipetting.
39. Immediately remove 10 µL of the cell suspension for counting with a hemocytometer.
 Typically, prolonged differentiation in CDBLY2 will yield 5 × 106 cells per well. A minimum of
 11.25 × 106 cells will be required for 45 organoids to perform both PT functional assays and
 immunofluorescence outlined below.
40. Calculate the cell suspension volume required for 250,000 cells and dispense this volume
 into individual 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, allowing one tube per organoid (Fig. 1).
 For the generation of 45 organoids, we recommend preparing two or three extra tubes of
 250,000 cells in case the cell micromass breaks during aspiration.

Nature Protocols | Volume 18 | November 2023 | 3229–3252 3244

Protocol


41. Top up the medium volume in each tube to 200 µL with E6/2% FBS.
42. Centrifuge tubes three times at 300g for 3 min, rotating the tubes 180° between each
 centrifugation step. While centrifugation can be performed in two batches if only a 24-tube
 rotor is available, it is preferable for all tubes to be centrifuged simultaneously, either by
 using two centrifuges or a larger capacity rotor.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP If centrifugation is to be performed in batches, begin transferring the
 first batch of cell micromasses to the Transwell inserts (Step 46) while the second batch is
 underway to minimize delay.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
43. Following the third centrifugation, use a P200 pipette with a wide-bore tip to gently push
 each cell pellet down to the base of the tube and aspirate the micromass into the pipette tip
 opening.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Perform this step gently without breaking the cell micromasses while
 minimizing medium carry-over. It may help to aspirate a small volume of medium into the
 opening of the tip before pushing the cell pellet down to the base of the tube, reducing the
 possibility of the micromass sticking to the side of the tip.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
44. Transfer three micromasses to each Transwell insert, working swiftly without delay. Ensure
 minimal medium carryover by allowing each micromass to settle into the pipette tip
 opening before dispensing in a single droplet that is touched onto the Transwell membrane.
45. Once all cell micromasses have been added to the membranes, perform a CHIR pulse by
 adding 1 mL of E6-containing 5 µM CHIR99021 to the base of the Transwell and incubating
 the cell micromasses for precisely 1 h in the 37 °C incubator.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP If a larger number of organoids are to be made, or if a delay is
 encountered, perform the CHIR pulsing in batches of one or two Transwell plates.
46. Following the CHIR pulse, replace the medium with E6 containing 200 ng/mL FGF9 and
 1 µg/mL heparin to initiate organoid patterning.
47. Culture the organoids for 5 d (to day 18), replacing the E6/FGF9/heparin medium once on
 day 3 postorganoid generation (day 16).
48. Day 18: on day 5 post-organoid generation (day 18), change the culture medium to E6
 (without FGF9 or heparin).
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Monitor the organoids regularly to confirm continued organoid
 patterning, including the appearance of renal vesicles and elongating nephrons
 surrounding a darkening core, which typically occurs by day 21 (ranging from day 19
 to day 22) (Fig. 2e).
49. Culture the organoids for a further 9 d after FGF9/heparin removal, refreshing the
 E6 medium every second day, to day 27 (equivalent to D13 + 14 in the original related
 research6).
50. Day 27: set aside two plates (12 wells) of organoids for PT functionality assays (albumin and
 DAPI uptake, detailed in Steps 52–59 and 60–71) and remove the remaining plate of three
 wells from the incubator to undergo fixation for later immunofluorescence.
51. For fixation, aspirate medium from the base of the transwell and replace with 1 mL per well
 of cold 4% PFA, also adding one drop of PFA on top of each organoid. Incubate the plate for
 30 min at 4 °C, then remove PFA using a P1000 pipette and discard in the appropriate PFA waste
 container. Wash three times with PBS, 10 min per wash in the same manner as fixation, adding
 1 mL of PBS to the basolateral Transwell compartment and one drop on top of each organoid.
 After the final wash, add 1 mL of sterile PBS to the Transwell basolateral compartment and seal
 the plate with parafilm for short-term storage. For longer-term storage, proceed to Steps 73–77
 and store the 48-well plate of organoids sealed with parafilm at 4 °C for up to 1 year.
 ▲ CAUTION PFA is toxic and must be handled in a fume cupboard.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Do not store the fixed organoids long term in a large volume (more
 than 1.5 mL) of PBS while still attached to the Transwell inserts. This may lead to
 flooding of the membrane and detachment of the organoids, complicating subsequent
 immunofluorescence steps. We also do not recommend storage of fixed organoids in sealed
 Transwell plates owing to their more rapid evaporation and risk of sample loss.

 incubator. Label three wells ‘test’ and three wells ‘control’.
64. Aspirate culture medium from the three control wells and replace this medium with
 the ‘inhibitor’ medium, first adding a drop on top of each organoid then dispensing the
 remaining 1 mL to the basolateral compartment of each Transwell.
65. Incubate the organoids for 30 min in a 37 °C incubator.
66. Following incubation, aspirate the inhibitor medium from the control wells, as well as the

Wholemount immunofluorescence for PT markers
● TIMING 2 d
72. Retrieve the PFA-fixed organoids from Step 53 stored in PBS.
73. If the organoids have not yet been removed from the Transwell inserts, prepare a 48-well
 plate with 0.5 mL PBS per well.
74. Lift each Transwell insert from the six-well Transwell plate and use a sharp scalpel blade to
 cut the Transwell surrounding each organoid in a small square.
75. Using fine-tipped forceps, grip the edge of the Transwell square and remove it from the
 surrounding membrane.
76. Place an organoid attached to one of the small squares of Transwell membrane face-up into
 a well of PBS within the 48-well plate.
77. Repeat this for all remaining organoids, then circle the wells to undergo staining via
 immunofluorescence.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP To account for organoid variability, we recommend staining three
 organoids per staining panel. In the following protocol, this will utilize six organoids,
 with three remaining stored as spare unused organoids if required. The antibodies used
 in this protocol have all previously been validated in human and human stem cell-derived
 organoids. However, if adapting this protocol for use with unvalidated antibodies, or to
 test for background staining generated by unvalidated secondary antibodies, ensure
 that an appropriate number of additional organoids are generated to run these control
 conditions.
 ■ PAUSE POINT Fixed organoids can be stored at 4 °C in PBS, with the plate sealed in
 Parafilm for up to 12 months.
78. Using a P1000 pipette, tilt the 48-well plate at an angle and aspirate the PBS from the
 very edge of each well. If the organoids have remained attached to the small square of
 Transwell membrane, they will not be aspirated by the pipette during staining. However, if
 the organoids have become detached, we recommend placing the 48-well plate on a blue
 background to improve visibility of the organoids and keep the plate flat whilst slowly
 aspirating the PBS (or subsequent staining solutions) to avoid aspirating the organoid into
 the tip.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Do not touch the organoid with the pipette tip or forceps as this can cause
 the organoid to break or become irretrievably adhered to the tip/forceps.
79. Replace the PBS with 200 µL per well of blocking solution and incubate on a rocking
 platform at 4 °C for 3–5 h.
80. While blocking, prepare the primary and secondary antibody solutions in 0.1%
 phosphate-buffered Triton-X-100 (PBTX) according to the dilutions listed in Tables 1 and 2,
 allowing 150 µL per well with an additional 150 µL to account for pipetting error.
81. Following the blocking incubation, aspirate the blocking solution and add 150 µL of primary
 antibody solution to each well.
82. Incubate the plate overnight (~16 h) on a rocking platform at 4 °C.
83. The following day, aspirate the primary antibody and wash for a minimum of 3 h in
 three changes of PBS (1 mL volumes), returning to the rocking platform at 4 °C between
 washes.
84. After the final wash, aspirate the PBS and add 150 µL of secondary antibody solution to each
 well and cover the plate with layers of aluminium foil or another opaque material to prevent
 light exposure.
85. Incubate the plate overnight (~16 h) on a rocking platform at 4 °C (preferably in the dark to
 further prevent light exposure).
86. The following day, aspirate the secondary antibody and wash for a minimum of 3 h in three
 changes of PBS (1 mL volumes), returning to the rocking platform at 4 °C between washes
 and keeping it protected from light.

Protocol


87. After the final wash, working one well at a time to prevent the organoids drying, aspirate
 the PBS from the well and use fine-tipped forceps to grip the edge of the small square
 of Transwell membrane with attached organoid. If an organoid has detached from the
 membrane and folded during the staining process, do not attempt to unfold the organoid
 with a pipette tip or forceps. Instead, gently agitate the well in a low volume of PBS or
 add drops of PBS directly on top of the organoid from above the well to encourage
 unfolding. Once the organoid is flat, slowly aspirate the remaining PBS from the well,
 while keeping the organoid suspended above the square of Transwell membrane from
 which it detached.
 ▲ CRITICAL Only proceed with the steps below once the PBS has been completely removed
 and the organoid has settled back onto the membrane.
88. Lift each membrane with attached organoid out of the wells and place face-down on
 a glass-bottomed imaging dish. Add a small drop (~20 µL) of glycerol to just cover the
 organoid.
 ■ PAUSE POINT In our experience, stained organoids in glycerol can be covered in
 foil, protected from light and stored for 1–3 weeks at 4 °C before imaging. However,
 fluorescence intensity will decline over time.
89. Image using a confocal microscope with 405, 488, 594 and 640 nm lasers to identify
 PT-specific markers within nephrons stained with EPCAM (Fig. 4a,b).

 To ensure optimal seeding density at D0, iPSCs should be seeded (25,000 cells/well)
 for differentiation at D−1 by dissociating an 80% confluent cell monolayer to small
 cell clusters 2 d post-passage (Steps 10–23). Owing to differences in cell counting
 accuracy between personnel carrying out this protocol and variation in growth rates
 between hPSC lines, it may be necessary for the protocol to be initially trialled with a
 range of cell densities, e.g., 15,000–50,000 cells/well
 For sensitive cell lines, a high level of death may occur upon seeding that will
 affect the density at D0. In this situation, care should be taken not to over-pipette
 the cells during dissociation. It may also be necessary to increase the seeding
 density and omit the centrifugation step before seeding for differentiation (Step 17).

Anticipated results

This method of generating kidney organoids from hPSCs with a high proportion of PTs and
spatially arranged nephrons has been successfully applied in our laboratory to six different

Nature Protocols | Volume 18 | November 2023 | 3229–3252 3249

Protocol


hPSC lines, including both iPSCs and ESCs. In-depth gene expression profiling via single-cell
RNA sequencing has been performed on PT-enhanced organoids derived from two of these
lines, confirming improved PT maturation compared with standard kidney organoids based
on a range of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets6. These analyses have also
confirmed minimal variation between PT-enhanced organoids within an experiment and highly
similar characteristics between PT-enhanced organoids derived from separate experiments
with respect to PT gene upregulation, protein expression and substrate uptake capacity6.
 The commencement of differentiation toward intermediate mesoderm upon CHIR99021
administration is similar in methodology and outcome to our original standard kidney
organoid differentiation protocols9,10, producing a monolayer of single cells with triangular
morphologies by around day 2 post-CHIR99021 induction as the cells begin to undergo
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. However, in the PT-enhanced organoid protocol, both
CHIR99021 and FGF9 exposure is prolonged (days 0–5 and days 5–13, respectively) to encourage
posteriorization of the primitive streak and intermediate mesoderm, while exposure to the
additional factors within CDBLY2 medium (days 8–13) support the ongoing specification
to metanephric mesenchyme and nephron progenitors, characterized by gene expression
profiling6. As a result of this FGF9 exposure and prolonged differentiation, cells grow rapidly
and continuously, passing through the typical ‘hilly’ monolayer morphology previously
reported at day 7 of differentiation9 but culminating in the growth of cell ‘mounds’ that appear
browner than surrounding patches of monolayer by day 13 (Fig. 2d). Some cell death during this
crowded cell growth phase is not unexpected. However, patches of epithelialization (Fig. 2c,
bottom) should not be visible if the differentiation has progressed correctly.
 Following aggregation and plating of cell micromasses on day 13, evidence of successful
differentiation will be present within 2 d (days 14 and 15) as cells appear to undergo clustering
and patterning within the micromass (Fig. 2e). By days 16–18, one of the early unique features
of this protocol becomes apparent, with the formation of large renal vesicle-like structures that
are distinctly visible by brightfield microscopy (Fig. 2e). These renal vesicle structures elongate
in parallel to darkening of the organoid core, with radially aligned nephrons surrounding a
stromal core typically visible around day 21 (ranging from days 19 to 22) (Fig. 2d). We have
experienced substantial variation in the size of the core and the timing of its appearance
between experiments and cell lines (Fig. 2f).
 Evaluation of successfully differentiated PT-enhanced organoids reveals abundant uptake of
TRITC–albumin and the organic cation surrogate, DAPI, into organoid nephrons. This feature is
indicative of functionality of the MEG/CUB complex, which is important for PT-mediated protein
reabsorption56, and MATE-1/MATE-2 transport capacity, responsible for PT-specific organic cation
transport57 (Fig. 3a,b). Furthermore, immunofluorescence of PT-enhanced organoids confirms
expression of key PT markers, LTL, MEG and CUBN, within EPCAM-positive PTs (Fig. 4a,b).
The striking nephron alignment within these organoids is characterized by a central ring of
NPHS1-positive podocytes of glomeruli and radiating EPCAM-positive epithelial tubules (Fig. 4a).
