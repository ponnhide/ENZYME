 • Human iPSCs: the data shown in this manuscript were generated using two human induced
 pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines derived from human foreskin fibroblast line CCD-
 1112Sk/CRL-2429 (ATCC, RRID: CVCL_2769) and the female fibroblast line WS1 CRL-1502
 (ATCC, RRID: CVCL_2766). CRL-2429/SIX2Cre/Cre; GAPDHdual was generated from CCD-1112Sk/
 CRL-2429 using simultaneous reprogramming and gene editing as previously described7
 and is available for distribution from the Washington University Kidney Translational
 Research Centre, St Louise, MO (accessible via the ReBuilding a Kidney Reporter Cell Line
 database (https://www.rebuildingakidney.org/chaise/recordset/#2/Cell_Line:Reporter_
 Cell_Line@sort(RID), identified as ‘SIX2:Cre/GAPDH:Dual’). The second iPSC line,
 CRL1502.2, was derived from WS1 CRL-1502 using episomal reprogramming methods6, with
