Protocol

Introduction

Nephrons are the functional units of the kidney. On average, 1 million nephrons are present in
one human kidney. Each nephron consists of >30 different cell types that are spatially organized
to perform its diverse kidney functions from glomerular filtration to tubular reabsorption and
secretion1–4. Six2+ nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) have a central role in kidney organogenesis:
they self-renew and give rise to all the major nephron cell types5. Over the past decade, kidney
organoids have been developed from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) by recapitulating
normal kidney organogenesis6–22. To develop nephron organoids, hPSCs transition sequentially
through mesoderm, intermediate mesoderm and posterior intermediate mesoderm to
generate a transient hPSC-induced NPC (iNPC) population. These transient iNPCs then
further develop into nephron cell types in the organoids. Those pioneering in vitro human
kidney models have enhanced our understanding of human kidney development and disease
mechanisms23. Despite the progress, cellular immaturity and the presence of large numbers of
off-target cell types in hPSC-derived kidney organoids have hindered the development of safe
and effective kidney-replacement therapies and prevented the accurate modeling of kidney
diseases, especially adult-onset diseases23–27. In this protocol, we describe in detail our recently
published methodologies for deriving long-term expandable human iNPC lines from hPSCs.
These iNPC lines exhibit a stable cell-proliferation rate, retain NPC marker gene expression
over long-term culture and can be directly used for the generation of nephron organoids,
demonstrating minimal off-target cell types with enhanced organoid maturity28 (Fig. 1).

Development of the protocol
To track and purify hPSC-derived iNPCs, we first used the CRISPR–Cas9 system to engineer
hPSCs with a SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry dual reporter system28,29. The protocol to induce transient
iNPCs from hPSCs was optimized from a previously published Morizane protocol7,30 by using
a series of different combinations of growth factors and small molecules at each stage of hPSC
differentiation to mirror the respective signals activated during kidney organogenesis. In the first
stage to generate a primitive streak from hPSCs, a combination of WNT agonist (CHIR99021) and
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitor (noggin or dorsomorphin) was used in the original
Morizane protocol. Here, we used a different BMP inhibitor, LDN193189, which is commonly used
