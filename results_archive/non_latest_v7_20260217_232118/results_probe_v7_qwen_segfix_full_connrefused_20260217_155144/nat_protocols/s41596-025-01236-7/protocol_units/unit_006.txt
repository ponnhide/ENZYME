Materials

Biological materials
 • hESCs (H1 and H9 cell lines, RRIDs: CVCL_9771; and CVCL_UM37, respectively). Details for
 generating their derivative SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry dual reporter hPSC line are described
 in our prior publication28. This cell line is available upon a completed Materials Transfer
 Agreement
 ▲ CAUTION Institutional and federal regulations must be followed when using hPSC
 lines. The experiments using hPSC lines in this study were approved by the University of
 Southern California Stem Cell Research Oversight Committees guidelines and regulations
 (SCRO protocol # 2018-2).
 ▲ CAUTION The cell lines used in your research should be regularly checked to ensure
 that they are authentic and that no cell line misidentification or cross-contamination has
 occurred. Check all cell cultures for mycoplasma regularly by using PCR testing or other
 commercial kit-based testing.
