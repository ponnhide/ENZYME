Reagent setup
Activin A (50 μg ml−1 stock)
Resuspend lyophilized activin A (10 µg) in 200 μl of 4 mM hydrochloride (HCl) supplemented
with 0.1% (vol/vol) FBS to make a stock solution of 50 μg ml−1. Dispense as 10-μl aliquots into
microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80 °C for ≤12 months.

A83-01 (10 mM stock)
Add 1.186 ml of DMSO to 5 mg of A83-01 powder to make a 10 mM stock solution. Dispense as
20-μl aliquots of A83-01 stock into microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80 °C for ≤12 months.

BMP7 (100 μg ml−1 stock)
Resuspend lyophilized BMP7 (500 μg) in 5 ml of 4 mM HCl supplemented with 0.1% (vol/vol) FBS
to make a stock solution of 100 μg ml−1. Dispense as 20-μl aliquots into microcentrifuge tubes
and store at −80 °C for ≤12 months.

CHIR99021 (50 mM stock)
Add 1.075 ml of DMSO to 25 mg of CHIR99021 powder to make a 50 mM stock solution
(first stock). Make 50-μl aliquots in microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80 °C for ≤12 months.
50 μl of 50 mM stock solution is added to 200 μl of DMSO to make a 10 mM stock solution
(second stock). Dispense as 15-μl aliquots of second CHIR99021 stock into microcentrifuge
tubes and store at −20 °C for ≤6 months.

DAPT (10 mM stock)
Add 2.312 ml of DMSO to 10 mg of DAPT powder to make a 10 mM stock solution. Dispense as
50-μl aliquots of DAPT stock into microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80 °C for ≤12 months.
