PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 discuss three different ways to genetically manipulate organoids and how to select and grow clonal
 organoids. Finally, we describe xenotransplantation of BC organoids.
 We provide information on morphology, growth rate and passaging conditions for 45 organoid
 cultures encompassing normal, primary tumor and metastatic cultures as a reference guide for
 organoid maintenance, taking into account inter-culture variation (Table 1). Establishing a breast
 organoid culture, from tissue isolation until the ﬁrst passage, will take 7–21 d. Genetically manip-
 ulating an organoid culture and generating a selected clonal line at passage 1 will take 14–21 d.
 Expanding an organoid culture for transplantation usually requires more than 4 weeks and depends
 on the number of mice injected, as well as the organoid proliferation rate. To establish, maintain and
 manipulate breast organoids, expertise in 3D (organoid) culturing is useful but not essential. For
 in vivo work, appropriate facilities and expertise in mouse handling and maintenance are required.

 Applications
 We anticipate that preclinical researchers in the BC ﬁeld can use this protocol in a tailor-made
 fashion, by combining parts suited to their speciﬁc research needs. Normal organoids provide a
 valuable resource for studying development and function of the human mammary gland8. For
 understanding de novo oncogenesis, normal breast organoids can be subjected to CRISPR–Cas9
 editing to efﬁciently knock out tumor suppressor genes9, or organoids from individuals with a
 hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome, such as BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, can be used. Addi-
 tionally, organoids can be used to assess the efﬁcacy of novel drugs, both in vitro as well as upon
 engraftment in vivo. These organoid xenograft models can also be used to visualize tumor growth and
 cancer cell behavior in vivo through the introduction of a mammary imaging window10. Importantly,
 due to the retained genetic and histologic features of the original patient tumor7, BC organoids can be
 used as a clinical tool to aid personalized medicine, by assessing drug responses in a patient-speciﬁc
 manner. Although the methods described have been optimized for breast organoids, the sections on
 genetic manipulation and clonal selection can be applied to a wide variety of organoid cultures with
 minor adjustments, thus affecting a wide research ﬁeld beyond BC.

 Comparison with other methods and possible limitations
 In comparison to commonly used BC cell lines11 or BC spheroids12, BC organoids can be grown long
 term, while recapitulating the complex genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity7 that is characteristic of
 BC13,14. Although several groups have reported 3D model systems for studying normal mammary
 development15,16, these do not allow the extended culture of all mammary lineages, in contrast to the
 normal breast organoids reported here8. Different from previously developed methods to generate
 patient-derived xenografts17, the injection-based method for estrogen pellet implantation and BC
 organoid xenotransplantation used here circumvents the need for complex surgical procedures. As
 compared to growth properties of human intestinal organoids, which can be passaged 1:6 every week
 with limited variation among samples6, the proliferation rate of breast organoids is relatively slow and
 can differ substantially between donors. The splitting ratio can vary from 1:6 weekly to 1:2 weekly,
 biweekly or even less frequently (Table 1). It should be noted that maintenance of 3D breast organoid
 cultures is relatively laborious and costly compared to most other in vitro breast cultures.

 Experimental design
 Expansion medium (reagent setup)
 We describe the preparation of an expansion medium that was previously published7 (referred to as
 ‘Type 1’; Table 2). In addition, we introduce an alternative expansion medium, similar to that
 developed for long-term ovarian cancer organoid cultures18 (referred to as ‘Type 2’; Table 2), which
 can improve the growth properties of some organoid cultures (Fig. 2a and Table 1). We advise to
 grow newly established organoid cultures in both Type 1 and Type 2 expansion medium, to deﬁne the
 most optimal medium type per donor. We use homemade R-spondin-1, Noggin and Wnt3a con-
 ditioned media, for which detailed production protocols are available19–22. We strongly recommend
 using these homemade conditioned media, as we experienced superior performance compared to
 commercial compounds. However, we do provide commercial alternatives in the ‘Reagents’ section.

 Organoid derivation (Steps 1–40)
 We describe the establishment of an organoid culture, as previously published7. Patient resection
 material is cut into small pieces, washed thoroughly and digested with collagenase. After additional

 washing and ﬁltration, the digested tissue is plated in basement membrane extract (BME) and
 supplemented with expansion medium (Fig. 2b,c). BME, a gel-like substance that polymerizes at
 temperatures above 10 °C, is used to mimic the extracellular matrix and provide support for 3D
 organoids (Fig. 2d,e). Matrigel can be used as an alternative for BME with similar performance
 (Fig. 2f; see ‘Reagents’ section). Organoid derivation is optimal for tissues that contain a minimal
 amount of fat and necrotic tissue. The desired epithelial tissue for organoid generation usually
 appears as ﬁrm, pink-to-brownish tissue, whereas necrotic tissue is usually softer and darker. Fat
 tissue is soft and white to yellow and can be easily scraped or cut off.

 Organoid maintenance (Steps 41–48)
 The split ratio, passage interval and method of organoid dissociation differ considerably among
 donors and should be optimized for each newly established organoid culture (Table 1). Organoids can
 be passaged 7–21 d after organoid establishment (Steps 1–40) or after the previous split at a 1:2–1:8
 ratio. Refer to Table 1 for a guideline. The time of passage and split ratio should be optimized for each
 newly established organoid culture based on conﬂuency. The best moment to passage is just before
 organoids in the center of the BME drop start dying, characterized by shedding of debris or a darker
 appearance, or when organoids reach a diameter larger than 300 μm (further referred to as a
 ‘conﬂuent well’). We describe both single-cell organoid passaging by trypsinization (Step 43A; Fig. 2g)
 and passaging via organoid fragments by mechanical disruption, referred to as shearing (Step 43B;
 cells (Table 1), because single cells are slower at growing into new organoids and have a higher chance
 of dying compared to fragments. Both methods can be tried for newly established cultures, especially
 for fast-growing cultures. In some occasions, for instance when cell counts are critical, single-cell
 passaging should be used. If you want to generate clonal organoid cultures after transfection, we
 recommend using an organoid culture that allows passaging via single cells. Using single cells, as
 opposed to fragments, will increase the likelihood that the organoids growing out after selection
 (e.g., by puromycin) indeed originate from single cells and are, thus, clonal.
 We also provide guidelines for culturing at appropriate organoid densities and describe how to
 minimize cell death and recognize a conﬂuent well of organoids (Step 49–53; Fig. 2h–j). Additionally,
 we describe procedures and conditions for long-term storage (Steps 54–57) and recovery after
 cryopreservation (Steps 58–64). We recommend cryopreserving at least six cryovials for each newly
 established organoid culture at an early passage (< passage 5).

 Genetic manipulation (Steps 65A–C)
 We discuss three different methods for genetically modifying breast organoids, including
 Lipofectamine 2000 for transient transfection with moderate-to-high efﬁciency (Step 65A), electro-
 poration for transient transfection with high efﬁciency (Step 65B; used for Fig. S4 of ref. 7) or

 lentiviral infection for stable DNA transduction (Step 65C; used for Fig. 1 of ref. 9) (Fig. 3a–c).
 Speciﬁc conditions (e.g., DNA concentration, viral titer and number of organoid cells) or settings
 (e.g., voltage used for electroporation) require optimization for each experiment and culture. We
 recommend using control transfection or transduction vectors with a ﬂuorescent label to assess
 efﬁciency of the procedure (Fig. 3b–e).

 Organoid selection and clonal cultures (Steps 66–77)
 Genetically modiﬁed organoids can be selected by antibiotic addition if a resistance gene has been
 introduced or by addition or withdrawal of other medium components. For instance, addition of
 Nutlin-3a will kill all cells expressing wild-type P53 and can be used to select P53-mutated organoids

 c, Representative image of a tumor grown from orthotopically injected BC organoids. Scale bar, 5 mm.

 (Fig. 3c)7,9. In addition, withdrawal of epidermal growth factor (EGF) can select for cells over-
 expressing KRAS23. We recommend deﬁning the optimal concentration per selection agent and
 organoid culture, which is often the lowest concentration that kills 100% of untreated organoids.
 Selection and propagation of individual organoids can be used to generate a clonal culture (Fig. 3d,e).
 Non-manipulated organoids should be used as a control. Although sub-cloning for each organoid
 culture can be assessed, we recommend using organoid cultures that efﬁciently expand after passaging
 from single cells for better success rates.

 Xenotransplantation (Steps 78–108)
 A large quantity of organoids is necessary for engraftment (Steps 78–89), usually varying between
 0.25 × 106 and 1 × 106 cells per injected site in the form of intact organoids, for a better engraftment
 rate compared to single cells. These numbers require optimization per organoid culture. Organoid
 cultures with a fast growth rate in vitro tend to engraft better in vivo. We describe surgery-free
 estrogen pellet implantation (Steps 90–97; Fig. 4a) before orthotopic organoid injection (Steps
 98–108; Fig. 4b) to provide an exogenous source of estrogen that facilitates tumor engraftment and
 growth24,25 (Fig. 4c). We recommend practicing organoid injection by injecting 30 μl of transplan-
 tation medium with 5% trypan blue, followed by dissection, to conﬁrm localization in the mammary
 fad pad. It is important to be aware of potential bladder complications that might arise with estrogen
 pellets26. Of note, estrogen pellets either were9 or were not7 used in previous BC organoid trans-
 plantation studies. Mice should be monitored closely for signs of discomfort over the duration
 of the experiment.

 Y-27632 dihydrochloride (ROCK inhibitor)
 To prepare a 100 mM stock solution (20,000×), dissolve 10 mg of powder in 312 μl of
 DMSO (RT). Store 100-μl aliquots at −20 °C for up to 1 year. CRITICAL Be aware that the
 c

 published half-life of Y-27632 is shorter than the time we advise to store Type 1 and Type 2 expansion
 medium (1 week). In general, 4 °C-stored expansion medium can be used at any moment for organoid
 propagation with good performance within a week from preparation. However, for organoid estab-
 lishment from tissue (Steps 11–40), after genetic manipulation (Steps 65–89) or when passaging single
 organoids (Steps 90–101), we recommend using expansion medium that is as fresh as possible for
 optimal recovery of single cells.

 Transplantation medium
 Prepare this medium while harvesting organoids for transplantation (Steps 105–107). Account for
 40 μl of transplantation buffer per injection, plus at least 10% extra. Mix equal volumes of ice-cold
 Type 1 or Type 2 medium (donor dependent) and BME, avoiding bubbles. Store on ice until organoid
 pellet is ready for resuspension.
