 Blood vessels are fundamental to animal life and have critical roles in many diseases, such as stroke, myocardial infarction
 and diabetes. The vasculature is formed by endothelial cells that line the vessel and are covered with mural cells,
 speciﬁcally pericytes in smaller vessels and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) in larger-diameter vessels. Both
 endothelial cells and mural cells are essential for proper blood vessel function and can be derived from human pluripotent
 stem cells (hPSCs). Here, we describe a protocol to generate self-organizing 3D human blood vessel organoids from
 hPSCs that exhibit morphological, functional and molecular features of human microvasculature. These organoids are
 differentiated via mesoderm induction of hPSC aggregates and subsequent differentiation into endothelial networks and
 pericytes in a 3D collagen I–Matrigel matrix. Blood vessels form within 2–3 weeks and can be further grown in scalable
 suspension culture. Importantly, in vitro–differentiated human blood vessel organoids transplanted into immunocompro-

 Introduction
 The vasculature is one of the ﬁrst organs to develop during embryogenesis and is fundamental to the
 function of all other organs. In the adult, blood vessel dysfunction is linked to major diseases such as
 stroke, heart attack, diabetes or cancer1. Blood vessels are composed of endothelial cells, which
 provide the inner lining and form the luminal tubes, and mural cells such as pericytes or vSMCs,
 which cover the outer endothelial wall of small and large vessels. During development, endothelial
 cells arise from mesodermal progenitors under the stimulus of ﬁbroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2),
 bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and
 organize into primitive tubular networks, a process called vasculogenesis2–4. Subsequently, during the
 process of angiogenesis, this primitive plexus remodels and new vessels sprout and branch until a
 mature circulatory network is formed5. This process requires endothelial cells to specify into tip cells,
 which are highly migratory endothelial cells leading the newly forming vessel, and stalk cells, which
 follow the tip cell, and, through proliferation, contribute to vessel growth5. Stalk cells establish the
 actual lumen for blood transport through various mechanisms such as vacuolar fusion, inverse
 membrane blebbing and cord hollowing6,7.
 Both processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are highly dependent on VEGF-A signaling,
 which has a key role in regulating endothelial cell proliferation and survival8. Depending on the
 organ, mural cells can arise from mesoderm, neural crest or epicardial cells9. In the case of meso-
 dermal pericytes (e.g., heart, lung and gut pericytes) and endothelial cells, both can arise from a
 common mesodermal, ﬂk-1 (VEGFR-2) positive progenitor cell10. During the process of angiogenesis,
 the highly invasive tip cells of newly growing vessels recruit mural cells by platelet-derived growth
 factor beta (PDGF-B) release. In a paracrine manner, PDGF-B stimulates PDGF receptor beta
 (PDGFR-β) on the surface of developing mural cells, leading to the maturation and proliferation of
 pericytes and vSMCs9,11. The interaction between endothelial cells and mural cells stimulates the
 formation of a basement membrane and vessel quiescence and is essential for vascular development
 and blood vessel homeostasis12–14.
 In this protocol we describe how to generate human blood vessel organoids, composed of
 endothelial cells and pericytes, from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)15. After mesoderm

 based on a stepwise differentiation of hPSC aggregates with sequential changing of culture media and further
 differentiation into vascular networks in a 3D matrix. After aggregate formation in the presence of Y-27632,
 differentiation is initiated using CHIR99021 and BMP-4 to induce mesoderm, followed by VEGF-A and forskolin
 treatment to trigger vascular development. Aggregates are embedded in a collagen I–Matrigel matrix and stimulated
 with 15% FBS, VEGF-A and FGF-2 for vascular network formation (see upper illustration). Single vascular networks
 are extracted from the gel to generate blood vessel organoids that can be transplanted into NSG mice. A 3D

 induction, endothelial networks are formed by vessel sprouting and mature into stable blood vessels
 covered by pericytes and enveloped by a basement membrane. We have previously demonstrated that
 when these blood vessel organoids are transplanted into mice they form a stable and functional
 human vasculature15.

 Development of the protocol
 During development, vascular progenitors, which can give rise to endothelial and mural cells, emerge
 from lateral and posterior mesoderm10. Previous protocols described highly efﬁcient differentiation of
 hPSCs into mesoderm by WNT activation and BMP-4 stimulation, as well as further differentiation
 into endothelial cells upon VEGF-A exposure or into the pericyte/vSMC lineage upon exposure to
 PDGF-B or stimulation by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling16–28. Co-culture of
 separately differentiated endothelial cells and pericytes in 2D, as well as culture of early vascular
 progenitor cells in 3D, has been used previously to generate endothelial/pericyte networks18–20.
 We recently demonstrated the direct differentiation of hPSCs into self-assembling blood vessel
 organoids15. Starting from hPSC aggregates, WNT activation (GSK3β inhibition by CHIR99021) and
 BMP-4 stimulation induced the mesodermal fate. Subsequently VEGF-A and FGF-2 were used to
 induce the vascular cell fate. Those aggregates directly differentiated and grew into a sprouting
 vasculature in 3D collagen I–Matrigel gels driven by VEGF-A and FGF-2 stimulation in the presence
 of serum. Highly branched endothelial networks were generated within 11 d, starting from self-
 renewing hPSCs. Endothelial tubes form a lumen, show tight interaction with pericytes and are
 covered by a continuous basement membrane. Furthermore, cells reminiscent of the tip cell phe-
 notype, characterized by excessive ﬁlopodia formation, can be observed at the angiogenic front of
 sprouting aggregates. We were able to further dissect the vascular networks under a stereomicroscope
 into single blood vessel organoids that could be kept in suspension culture in a 96-well format, which
 allowed for high-throughput screen approaches (Figs. 1 and 2). Differentiated blood vessel organoids
 could be transplanted as a whole into the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice. In mice,
 blood vessel organoids gained access to the mouse vasculature and formed a fully human (endothelial
 cell + mural cell) vasculature in vivo that was stable for >6 months (the end of our observation

 period). In contrast to previous protocols26, vascular organoid transplantation does not require the
 co-transplantation of mouse mesenchymal cells to form a long-lasting vasculature. This is, to our
 knowledge, the ﬁrst detailed protocol for the generation of functional arteries, arterioles and venules
 from hPSCs.

 Alternative methods for generating vascular networks
 Several studies in which vascular networks were generated from hPSCs have been reported. For
 instance, Orlova et al.19 established 2D co-cultures of hPSC-derived endothelial cells and pericytes. In
 this setup, endothelial cells ﬁrst form islands that are surrounded by pericytes and then remodel into
 vessel-like structures, mimicking the formation of a primary vascular plexus. This co-culture
 approach allows the study of endothelial network formation and endothelial cell–pericyte interactions
 in a cell-autonomous manner. For example, if the affected vascular cell type of a disease is unknown,
 co-cultures enable the combination of healthy or patient-derived endothelial cells with pericytes
 from either healthy or affected donors. In blood vessel organoids and protocols that use common
 progenitor cells of endothelial cells and pericytes18, endothelial networks and pericytes are genetically
 identical. However, blood vessel organoids are fully 3D and recapitulate not only endothelial net-
 works and endothelial cell–pericyte interactions but also the formation of a vascular lumen and
 basement membrane deposition.
 Kusuma et al.18 used a synthetic hyaluronic acid-based matrix to differentiate early vascular cells,
 deﬁned as CD105+CD146+, into multicellular networks containing endothelial cells and pericytes.
 Those networks could be transplanted into mice, where the endothelial cells and pericytes integrated
 into the host vasculature. Although the approach of using a synthetic hydrogel holds promise for

 regenerative medicine, the formation of a chimeric vasculature of human and mouse vascular cells is
 challenging when studying functional aspects of human-derived vasculature. Transplanted blood
 vessel organoids, described here, form an entire PSC-derived vascular bed that can be used to study
 effects exclusively on a human vasculature. Samuel et al.26 generated functional blood vessels in vivo
 by co-transplanting hPSC-derived endothelial cells with either mouse or hPSC-derived mesenchymal
 progenitor cells. Although the mouse stromal cells supported long-term survival of human endo-
 thelium, hPSC-derived mesenchymal cells could sustain the human endothelial networks for only
 ~28 d, which makes it difﬁcult to study long-term effects on a fully human vasculature. The protocol
 we provide here, leads to a functional vasculature in vivo that is composed of hPSC-derived endo-
 thelial cells and pericytes; we have been monitoring growth in immunocompromised mice for
 >6 months.

 Applications and limitations of the protocol
 Differentiating hPSCs as described in this protocol recapitulates key steps of blood vessel develop-
 ment. Endothelial differentiation and sprouting into vascular networks, pericyte differentiation and
 recruitment to endothelial tubes, as well as the generation of a common basement membrane, are
 all key events for successful blood vessel growth and homeostasis5 that can be assessed with this
 protocol. For instance, we have used this protocol to investigate diabetic vascular basement mem-
 brane thickening, a hallmark of diabetic vascular complications, in vitro, by culturing blood vessel
 organoids in high-glucose medium containing the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 (ref. 15).
 Blood vessel organoid cultures in 96-well plates also enable reproducible screening of pharma-
 ceuticals. For example, vascular toxicity of small molecules could be tested, and both viability and
 apoptosis of the human endothelial networks and pericytes could be measured by ﬂuorescence
 microscopy or FACS. Furthermore, endothelial cell adherens junctions or endothelial cell–pericyte
 interaction can be analyzed to assess drug potential to induce or block vascular permeability in
 various environmental settings, such as a pro-inﬂammatory state. We have tested a selection of small
 molecules for their capacity to block diabetes-mediated vascular basement membrane thickening and
 found that the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT ((N-[N-(3,5-diﬂuorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)]-S-phenylgly-
 cine t-butyl ester)) greatly inhibits basement membrane expansion15. Blood vessel organoids could
 therefore serve as a platform to validate compounds from high-throughput screening in 2D cell
 culture systems or could be used to complement pre-clinical models. The number of blood vessel
 organoids needed per drug and concentration to obtain consistent results certainly depends on the
 readout of the screen. For readouts at single-vessel resolution (e.g., vascular basement membrane
 thickness15, endothelial cell–pericyte interaction and adherens junction opening) a low number of
 organoids is sufﬁcient (n = 2–5), because one organoid allows the assessment of many individual
 vessel segments. Screening readouts that compare whole organoids (e.g., measurement of ATP
 production) will certainly require a higher number of organoids per condition (n > 5).
 Furthermore, the transplantation of human blood vessel organoids into diabetic mice (strepto-
 zotocin model for type I diabetes) could recapitulate diabetic vascular basement membrane thick-
 ening and vessel regression. Modeling of human diabetic vasculopathy in an in vivo diabetic setting
 in chimeric mice also allows the measurement of functional vessel parameters such as increased
 permeability in diabetic human vessels15. Thus, this protocol is useful in the study of metabolic
 vascular diseases. Furthermore, this humanized mouse model could be used for preclinical toxicology
 testing, because it allows the effects of drugs or antibodies on human blood vessel physiology and
 disease to be investigated in vivo, complementing other preclinical models. Assessment of functional
 parameters, such as vessel permeability or blood ﬂow, in human blood vessels in response to the
 treatment could result in drugs being moved into clinical trials with greater conﬁdence in their
 safety and efﬁcacy.
 Modeling of rare genetic vascular disease using blood vessel organoids is a further possible
 application. Blood vessel organoids could be differentiated from patient-derived iPSCs with
 inherited forms of vascular diseases29. CRISPR–Cas9 could be used to repair mutations and to
 generate isogenic iPSC control lines30. Alternatively, patient-speciﬁc mutations can be knocked into
 well-established and well-performing hPSCs using CRISPR–Cas9 technology. The speciﬁcation of
 blood vessel organoids in vivo into arteries, arterioles and venules could allow the study of vascular
 diseases originating in capillaries and bigger vessels, as well as that of vascular diseases that arise from
 errors in arterial/venous speciﬁcation, for example, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or arter-
 iovenous malformation31. Of note, our protocol appears robust, and we have now successfully

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 generated blood vessel organoids from 13 different human iPSC and embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines,
 making studies with iPSCs from rare disease patients feasible.
 Besides a broad applicability, the protocol will certainly beneﬁt from further improvements in the
 future. Most importantly, perfused blood vessel organoids are currently available only after trans-
 plantation in vivo, but their establishment in vitro would be an important step forward and could
 allow the investigation of functional parameters such as permeability or immune-cell adhesion/
 extravasation under deﬁned and readily manipulated in vitro conditions. A recent study that applied
 ﬂow to poorly vascularized kidney organoids and showed enhanced vascularization and maturation
 of kidney organoids in vitro is promising32. Moreover, blood vessel organoids currently lack inter-
 action with other somatic cell types. Because blood vessels have to fulﬁll speciﬁc functions and
 are phenotypically very different in each organ33, it will be important to generate organotypic
 blood vessel organoids in the future that allow the investigation of organ-speciﬁc vessel diseases.
 Organotypic blood vessel organoids will also be important for possible tissue-regenerative applica-
 tions in the future.
 A further limitation is the use of animal products in this protocol, namely, the extracellular matrix
 (Matrigel and collagen I) and FBS. Those products show batch-to-batch variation of growth factor
 and protein content, which can impact the efﬁciency of the blood vessel organoid differentiation and
 thus negatively inﬂuence consistency between experiments. Beyond the need for batch testing, the use
 of animal products currently prevents the use of blood vessel organoids as a regenerative medicine in
 humans, an issue that needs to be resolved before moving such blood vessel organoids into human
 patients. To achieve good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliance, the following major changes
 must be applied to this protocol: (i) standardization of cell aggregate size (Steps 1–10), e.g., by
 implementing microwell culture plates34; (ii) use of serum-free media, e.g., vessel-supporting media,
 containing exclusively recombinant growth factors and deﬁned supplements35; and (iii) use of
 synthetic matrices for 3D culture36.

 Experimental design
 We have demonstrated that the protocol is reproducible with three independent hiPSC lines and
 an ESC line (H9)15. Differentiation variability in different hiPSC/hESC lines is a common problem
 with hPSC lines, which may affect the efﬁciency and timing of the protocol. Throughout we describe
 optimization steps that may be required for some hiPSC/hESC lines. In addition, we have slightly
 modiﬁed the ﬁrst steps of our previously published protocol15, and as a consequence it is now 1 week
 shorter and does not require control over oxygen levels. The improved method described here allows
 the generation of hPSC-derived blood vessel organoids over a period of ~16 d.
 Differentiation is achieved through six key steps (Figs. 1 and 2) and starts with the generation of
 cell aggregates in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. The hPSCs should exhibit optimal
 morphology and minimal background differentiation. Furthermore, the successful generation of
 stable aggregates is absolutely critical to achieving an efﬁcient blood vessel differentiation. Therefore,
 the size of the aggregates is crucial and can be inﬂuenced by both the number of cells used and the
 incubation time for aggregate formation. It is possible that both parameters must be optimized for
 each hPSC line used (see ‘Troubleshooting’ section). In this protocol, we use the iPSC line NC8 and
 use 2 × 105 cells per well (of a 6-well plate) for aggregate formation and incubate for 1 d (starting at
 day −1). When we work, for example, with H9 human ESCs, we use 5 × 105 cells per well (of a 6-well
 plate) and incubate for 3 d to obtain proper-size aggregates. Importantly, once stable aggregates with
 a size >50–100 µm in diameter (Fig. 2b) have been formed, the protocol is very robust and can be
 followed as described below without any further modiﬁcations.
 Next, we start to induce mesoderm (day 0 (d0)) by culturing the aggregates in CHIR99021 to
 activate WNT signaling and with BMP-4 for 3 d, before we switch to the vascular induction medium
 containing VEGF-A for 2 d (d3–d5). It is critical to collect the aggregates only by gravitation during
 medium change (d0, d3, d5) and to not apply additional forces by centrifugation. At day 5 (d5), the
 cell aggregates are embedded in a 3D collagen I–Matrigel matrix in 12-well plates. Here, the density of
 embedded aggregates is an important factor that will strongly inﬂuence the differentiation efﬁciency
 of the protocol. Seeding of too many aggregates per well will not provide the space required for the
 sprouting of vascular networks. Furthermore, differentiating aggregates in close proximity will result
 in them merging together into large aggregates, which generally leads to a less efﬁcient differentiation
 process. Very few aggregates, on the other hand, may not be viable and offer only a few vascular
 networks to analyze (Fig. 2e).

 After 5 d of sprouting (d10), the vascular networks can be assessed for the presence of
 endothelial cells and pericytes and further separated to prepare single blood vessel organoids
 (Fig. 2f–m). Owing to the elastic nature of the collagen I–Matrigel matrix, the whole matrix of one
 well containing 50–60 blood vessel networks can be extracted from the 12-well plate, and vascular
 networks can be liberated under a stereomicroscope, without loss of vascular architecture (Supple-
 mentary Video 1). The singularized networks will self-assemble into round blood vessel organoids
 that can be kept in suspension culture, preferentially in low-attachment 96-well U-bottom plates for
 up to 1 month after generation.
 Once the vascular networks have self-assembled into round blood vessel organoids (Fig. 2l,m), they
 can be transplanted under the kidney capsule of immunocompromised NOD/SCID/IL2Rγnull (NSG)
 mice as previously described for liver organoids37. The human blood vessels stably grow in mice and
 can be identiﬁed by staining with human-speciﬁc antibodies, such as anti-human CD31. Using reporter
 hPSC lines, we showed that in our staining protocol, the anti-human CD31 antibody does indeed only
 react with human endothelial cells15. Moreover, we found that almost all mural cells (>90%), covering
 human endothelium, are also of human origin15. Thus, this protocol generates a fully human
 vasculature that is stable for >6 months and connects to the endogenous mouse circulation. These
 human vessels can be tested for blood vessel perfusion and leakiness, for example, by i.v. injection of a
 human-speciﬁc CD31 antibodies or 70 kDa dextran. At later stages of analysis (~2–3 months after
 transplantation), the formation of arteries, arterioles and venules can be observed15.
