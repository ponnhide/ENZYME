Procedure
 Passage of PSCs (day −2) ● Timing 1–2 h
 1 Pre-coat 24-well plates with GFR Matrigel as described in Reagent setup. The coated plates can be
 wrapped in Paraﬁlm and kept for ≤2 weeks at 4 oC.
 CRITICAL STEP All tissue culture steps in this protocol should take place in a sterile environment
 c

 and be performed with aseptic technique to prevent culture contamination.
 2 Take a six-well plate of undifferentiated PSCs and remove the mTeSR1 by aspiration from the wells
 to be passaged (Fig. 2a).
 3 Wash the wells with 2 ml of sterile DPBS. Aspirate the DPBS.
 4 Add 1 ml of accutase to the wells.
 5 Incubate at 37 oC for 5 min, allowing PSC colonies to dissociate into single cells.
 6 Add 5 ml of warm DMEM/F12 to each well to sufﬁciently dilute the accutase.
 7 Gently triturate each treated well two to three times before transferring the 6 ml of PSCs in medium
 to a conical tube. Repeat the process with the remaining wells until all cells are collected into the
 same conical tube.
 8 Centrifuge the cells at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C.
 9 Aspirate the medium from the conical tube.
 10 Add warm mTeSR1 to the conical tube.
 11 Count the cells.
 12 Aspirate the Matrigel from the prepared Matrigel-coated 24-well plate (from Step 1).
 13 Plate the cells at a density of 100,000–150,000 cells/well in 500 μl of mTeSR1 including 10 μM
 Y-27632 on a Matrigel-coated tissue culture 24-well plate. Prepare cells with at least two
 independent wells to generate anterior and posterior gut spheroids at the same time.
 14 Place the 24-well plate in a tissue culture incubator and ensure that the single cells are evenly
 distributed in the wells by gently moving the 24-well plate side to side.
 15 Incubate overnight in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

 Change mTeSR medium (day −1) ● Timing 0.5 h
 16 Warm mTeSR1 at room temperature (15–25 °C).
 17 Conﬁrm that the plated cells are healthy and are growing at a uniformly high density.
 18 Aspirate old mTeSR1 with 10 μM Y-27632 to change the medium. Add fresh mTeSR1 without
 Y-27632 (Step 16), 500 μl/well for a 24-well plate.
 19 Place the 24-well plate back in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 Differentiation of PSCs into deﬁnitive endoderm (days 0–2)
 Day 0 ● Timing 0.5 h
 20 Check the conﬂuency of the cells by using an inverted microscope. Cells should have reached
 80–90% conﬂuence (Fig. 2b).
 CRITICAL STEP It is imperative that the cell conﬂuence is as close to 80–90% as possible. If the

 c
 cell density is too high or low, this can result in overgrowth of mesoderm, cell death after activin A
 treatment and/or incomplete differentiation. Before beginning differentiation, titrate the cell
 number for each line to ensure 80–90% conﬂuence on day 0. It is possible to wait an additional 24 h
 until this conﬂuency is reached; aspirate the mTeSR1 and add 500 μl of fresh mTeSR1 to each well.
 21 Warm an aliquot of day 0 medium to room temperature.
 c CRITICAL Pre-warming the medium on this day helps to increase cell survival.
 22 Aspirate the mTeSR1 medium. Add 0.5 ml/well of day 0 medium to the 24-well plate. Place the
 plate back in the incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.

 Day 1 ● Timing 0.5 h
 CRITICAL After 1 d of treatment with day 0 medium, there should be evidence of cell death and
 c

 ﬂoating cells in the medium. However, there should still be a layer of cells attached to the plate
 after treatment.
 23 View cells under an inverted microscope to determine if cells are still attached to the tissue culture
 plate (Fig. 2b). If there are few or no cells attached, abandon the protocol and restart.
 24 Aspirate the day 0 medium.
 25 Add 0.5 ml/well of fresh day 1 medium to the 24-well plate.
 26 Place the plate back in the incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.

 Day 2 ● Timing 0.5 h
 CRITICAL After 1 d of treatment with day 1 medium, there should be evidence of cell death and
 c

 ﬂoating cells in the medium. However, there should still be a layer of cells attached to the plate after
 treatment. View cells under an inverted microscope to determine if cells are still attached to the tissue
 culture plate (Fig. 2b). If there are few or no cells attached, abandon the protocol and restart.
 27 Aspirate the day 1 medium.
 28 Add 0.5 ml/well of fresh day 2 medium to the 24-well plate.
 29 Place the plate back in the incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.

 Differentiation of PSCs into anterior/posterior gut cells (days 3–6) ● Timing 0.5–1 h
 every day
 30 (Optional) If anterior or posterior gut cells cannot be differentiated successfully, conﬁrm that PSCs
 are induced to deﬁnitive endoderm on day 3 by immunostaining5. Endoderm markers, such as
 GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), SRY-Box transcription factor 17 (SOX17) and Forkhead box
 A2 (FOXA2), can be used to determine the efﬁciency of the deﬁnitive endoderm differentiation.
 Over 70% of cells should express these markers. An example of optimal results is shown in Fig. 2c.
 31 Each day on days 3–6, warm anterior day 3–6 medium and posterior day 3–6 medium at room
 temperature and then aspirate the media and replace with 500 μl/well of the prewarmed anterior
 day 3–6 medium (for anterior gut cells) and prewarmed posterior day 3–6 medium (for posterior
 gut cells). Owing to the high number of live cells in each well, the phenol red in the medium will
 turn yellow by 24 h. Conﬁrm the presence of 3D structures forming from the monolayer of cells,
 including attached and ﬂoating spheroids (Fig. 2d–f).
 32 (Optional) If anterior or posterior gut spheroids cannot be formed successfully, conﬁrm that PSCs
 are induced to anterior/posterior gut cells by ﬂow cytometry analysis. The epithelial marker
 EpCAM can be used to determine the efﬁciency of the gut differentiation. 60–90% of cells in both
 the anterior and posterior structures should express EpCAM on day 7. An example of optimal
 results is shown in Fig. 2g.

 Anterior/posterior gut spheroid formation (day 7) ● Timing 2–3 h
 33 On day 7, dissociate the anterior or posterior gut cells to single cells by incubation with TrypLE
 Express at 37 °C for 5 min (Fig. 3a).

 34 Add 500 μl of warm DMEM/F12 to each well to sufﬁciently dilute the TrypLE.
 35 Centrifuge the cells at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min and, after removing the supernatant, resuspend the
 pellet in day 7 medium.
 36 Plate the anterior or posterior gut cell suspensions in 96-well round-bottom ultra-low
 attachment plates at a density of 10,000 cells with 100 µl day 7 medium per well and
 incubate at 37 °C overnight to form spheroids. Prepare the same number of anterior and posterior
 spheroids.

 Anterior-posterior boundary spheroid formation (day 8) ● Timing 1–2 h
 37 On day 8, pick up one generated single posterior spheroid with entire medium in a well by using a
 mechanical pipette with a wide-bore 200-µl tip. Pipette up and down ﬁrst so that the spheroid gets
 suspended in the medium.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 38 Transfer the posterior spheroid to a well containing one anterior spheroid in the same 96-well
 round-bottom ultra-low attachment plate (Fig. 3b).
 39 Centrifuge the plate at 1,000 r.p.m. for 1 min to gather spheroids and incubate at 37 °C for 24 h to
 form fused boundary spheroids (anterior-posterior gut spheroid; A-P spheroids).
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 40 (Optional) From day 8 to day 11, perform whole-mount immunostaining analysis as a quality-
 control step (described in Box 1). SOX2, CDX2 and PDX1 expression can be used to determine the

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 Box 1 | Whole-mount staining of HBPOs
 At day 8, SOX2 positive (~80%) anterior and CDX2 positive (~80%) posterior gut spheroids should form. This can be conﬁrmed by whole-mount
 immunostaining, as shown in Fig. 3b. At day 11, PDX1-expressing HBP anlage cells should be observed at the boundary of anterior and posterior gut
 spheroids, as shown in Fig. 3d. HHEX can also be detected at day 11 in the boundary region. In long-term culture conditions, after day 20, PROX1-
 expressing tissue should start to grow (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, you should be able to see a tissue connection between AFP-expressing liver-like
 tissue and PDX1-expressing pancreas-like tissue (Fig. 4d,e).
