Procedure
 1 Aspirate the medium and remove the insert from the 24-well plate. Invert it and gently peel off the membrane from the insert using forceps.
 2 Excise the lung organoid and embed in a cryo-mold on dry ice.
 3 Cut frozen samples on a cryotome at the thickness of 10–12 μm and collect on adhesion microscope slides and air dry.
 4 Fix the samples in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, wash two times for 5 min in 50 mM glycine to inactivate the PFA, followed by washing
 in PBS.
 5 Permeabilize samples for 10 min in 0.2% PBST (PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100) and block by incubating in PBS containing 5% donkey serum for 1 h,
 then incubate overnight in primary antibody in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% donkey serum (for primary antibodies and suggested dilutions, see
 6 The next day, wash the samples three times in PBS and 1% donkey serum and incubate with secondary antibody (1:200) for 1 h at the room
 temperature (for secondary antibodies, see Table 1). Stain nuclei with DAPI (1:500).
 7 Mount sections with Mounting Reagent and coverslip. Slides are ready for the imaging when the mounting reagent dries properly.

 which in our hands gave similar results. We recommend growth factor-reduced Matrigel, as multiple
 factors at various concentrations may otherwise be present that could unpredictably affect organoid
 development, and therefore reproducibility. The mesenchyme is gradually lost after embedding in
 Matrigel. Approximately 90% of LBOs will yield rapidly expanding branching structures in which the
 fraction cells expressing a constellation of AT2 markers gradually increases, such that by d80, these
 form the majority of the cells (see ‘Anticipated results’). The organoids can be maintained in culture
 for more than 6 months. The entire protocol is conducted serum-free conditions.
 We found that several medium constituents need to be lot tested. These include Activin A, N2 and
 B27 medium, and Knockout Serum Replacement (see ‘Reagents’). Lot testing involves comparative
 analysis for maximal efﬁciency of DE generation as evaluated by expression of EPCAM, cKIT and
 CXCR4 by ﬂow cytometry. We found lot testing of Matrigel for organoid formation not necessary.
 The cultures can be analyzed at any step of the differentiation using several approaches, including
 immunoﬂuorescence (IF; Box 1), reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction
 (RT–qPCR; Box 1), electron microscopy, RNAseq and western blot, as we published previously20,27,28.
 We provide an example of IF (Fig. 5, antibodies in Table 1) and RT–qPCR analysis (Fig. 6, primer
 sequences in Table 2). Additionally, the cultures can be analyzed by scRNAseq (Boxes 2 and 3). As
 the quality of the input single-cell suspension is critical to scRNAseq, we provide a protocol to
 generate single-cell suspension from organoids in Matrigel (Box 2). In the ‘Anticipated results’
 section, we provide an example of scRNAseq analysis (Figs. 7 and 8).

 Expertise needed to implement the protocol
 Any scientist with experience in cell culture can apply this protocol. The required equipment, except
 for the low-oxygen incubator and the picking hood, is standard to most cell culture facilities, and
 reagents can be purchased from standard scientiﬁc vendors.

 ● hPSCs: this protocol was developed and optimized for differentiation of RUES2 human ESCs
 (Rockefeller University Embryonic Stem Cell Line 2, National Institutes of Health (NIH) approval
 number NIHhESC-09-0013, registration number 0013; RRID: CVCL_B810, passages 17–28) and has also
 been shown to work with two iPSC lines generated using Sendai Virus and modiﬁed messenger RNA
 from human dermal ﬁbroblasts (purchased from Mount Sinai Stem Cell Core facility, passages 17–26).
 We anticipate that this protocol could also be applied to other hESC and hiPSC lines, although some
 optimization might be required. This optimization is primarily geared at optimal DE induction as
 evaluated by ﬂow cytometry for expression of EPCAM, CXCR4 and cKIT (see Steps 28–66) and may
 require adjusting density of hPSCs and feeders, as well as duration of DE induction (typically ranging
 from 72 to 96 h) ! CAUTION Research involving human ESCs must comply with state, institutional and
 funding agency regulations. An approval from the Human Embryonic and Human Pluripotent Stem Cell
 Committee at the investigator’s home institute is usually required. We obtained approval from the
 Columbia University Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight committee (H.-W.S.) and Mount Sinai
 Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight committee (Y.-W.C.). ! CAUTION Karyotyping is required every
 6 months. ! CAUTION The cell lines used in your research should be regularly checked to ensure they are
 authentic and are not infected with mycoplasma.
