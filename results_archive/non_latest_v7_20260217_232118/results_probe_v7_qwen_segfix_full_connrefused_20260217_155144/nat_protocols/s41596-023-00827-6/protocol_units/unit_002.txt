Procedure
 1 Aspirate the medium from the insert with lung organoid and add 300 μl of Trizol to the insert using a P1000. Pipette up and down several times
 to break the Matrigel and collect the content of the insert. Transfer the organoid in trizol into a 1.5 ml tube and vortex until homogenized.
 2 Centrifuge the sample at 16,000g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the residual Matrigel. Take the supernatant and mix with equal amount of 100%
 ethanol and vortex thoroughly.
 3 Transfer the mixture into a Zymo-Spin IC Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30 s at 16,000g. Transfer the column into a new
 collection tube and discard the ﬂow through.
 4 In an RNase-free tube, add 5 μl DNase I (6 U/μl), 35 μl DNA Digestion Buffer and mix by gentle inversion. Add the mix directly to the column
 matrix. Incubate at room temperature (20–30 °C) for 15 min.
 5 Add 400 μl Direct-zol RNA PreWash to the column and centrifuge. Discard the ﬂow through and repeat this step.
 6 Add 700 μl RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 1 min to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Transfer the column
 carefully into an RNase-free tube.
 7 To elute RNA, add 15 μl of DNase-/RNase-free water directly to the column matrix and centrifuge.
 8 Reverse transcribe 100–1,000 ng of total RNA using the qScript XLT cDNA SuperMix. Combine following reagents in 0.2 ml microtubes:

 Component Volume for 20 μl reaction

 qScript XLT cDNA SuperMix 4 μl
 RNA template Variable
 RNase-/DNase-free water Variable
 Total volume 20 μl

 9 After sealing each reaction, vortex gently to mix contents. Centrifuge brieﬂy to collect components at the bottom of the reaction tube.
 10 Incubate as follows: 5 min at 25 °C, 60 min at 42 °C, 5 min at 85 °C, hold at 4 °C. Use ﬁrst-strand product for RT–qPCR ampliﬁcation.
 11 For RT–qPCR, prepare technical triplicates of 15 μl reaction:

 Component Volume for 15 μl reaction

 Sybr green 7.5 μl
 Forward primer (from 0.15 μl
 10 μM stock)
 Reverse primer (from 0.15 μl
 10 μM stock)
 cDNA Variable
 Water Variable
 Total volume 15 μl

 12 Prepare samples in a 384-well plate and run for 40 cycles. Use primers listed in Table 1. Calculate relative gene expression on the basis of the
 average cycle (Ct) value, normalized to GAPDH as the internal control and reported as fold change (2(-ddCT)).
