LAS-X (Leica) software was used for acquiring the microscopy data. Image Studio (V5.2)\n was used to acquire western blotting data. QuantStudio Real-Time PCR software (V1.7.1) was used to collect qPCR data. NovoExpress (V1.3.0)\n was used to generate flow cytometry data. Bowtie 1.2.2 was used to aligne sequencing reads.\n\n Data analysis Flow optometry data were analyzed with FlowJo (V10.8.1). The GraphPad Prism (V9.1.0) was used for statistical analyses. Fiji (ImageJ, V1.0\n and V1.53f51, and ImageJ2, V2.3.0/1.53q) was used for image quantification and processing. Imaris (V9.7.0) was used to process images. R\n 4.1.1 and Python 3.8.5 were used to analyze sequencing data. R version 4.1.2 was used to analyze disease genes expression. casTLE (https://\n bitbucket.org/dmorgens/castle/downloads/) was used to analyze CRISPR screen data. Image Studio (V5.2) was used to analyze western\n blotting data. ICE analysis (Synthego) was used to analyze the heterozygous/homozygous state of each mutant clone.\nFor manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the research but not yet described in published literature, software must be made available to editors and\nreviewers.

The following public datasets were used to support this\nstudy: the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) database (https://gene.sfari.org/). The single-cell RNA-sequencing data from Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells\nwere generated by Birey et al.6 and were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession numbers GSE93811. Trevino et al.30 data were\ndownloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus with the accession number GSE162170.

In addition, organoids having less than 3 migrating cells were not included.\n\n Replication Data shown in representative experiments was repeated with similar results in at least 3 independent experiments. All attempts at replication\n were successful. Sample sizes for other experiments were indicated in Figure legends. Data in Extended Data Fig. 10 e-h was collected from\n multiple organoids in one differentiation and part of these results verified findings in Fig. 3h and Fig. 4 f-i. NGS validation of the deletion of\n the candidate genes was performed once as it is standard practice and results were consistent with PCR genotyping experiments.\n\n Randomization Organoids and assembloids were randomly picked from cell culture plates for each assay. For the experiment used mouse tissues, mouse\n brain slices were randomly grouped for control and experimental treatment.\n\n Blinding Blinding of genotypes was used for all imaging analysis, flow cytometry analysis, and organoid size measurements. Blinding was not used or\n March 2021\n\n was not relevant for other experiments.\n\nReporting for specific materials, systems and methods\nWe require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies.
