 Morphogens direct neuroepithelial fates toward discrete regional identities
 in vivo. Neural organoids provide models for studying neural regionalization
 through morphogen exposure; however, we lack a comprehensive survey
 of how the developing human neuroepithelium responds to morphogen
 cues. Here we produce a detailed survey of morphogen-induced effects on
 the regional specification of human neural organoids using multiplexed
 single-cell transcriptomic screens. We find that the timing, concentration
 and combination of morphogens strongly influence organoid cell-type and
 regional composition, and that cell line and neural induction method impact
 the response to a given morphogen condition. We apply concentration
 gradients in microfluidic chips or increasing static concentrations in
 multi-well plates and observe different patterning dynamics in each
 scenario. Altogether, we provide a detailed resource on neural lineage
 specification that, in combination with deep learning models, can enable the
 prediction of differentiation outcomes in human stem-cell-based systems.
