Procedure
 1 Transplant blood vessel organoids into the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice as previously
 described37. When transplanting, use one blood vessel organoid per kidney and transplant the entire blood
 vessel organoid (Fig. 4a). Transplanted blood vessel organoids can be grown in mice for >6 months.
 CRITICAL STEP Inefﬁcient differentiation could lead to teratoma formation in mice.


 c
 2 Sacriﬁce mice and collect transplanted blood vessel organoids. If only one kidney is used for transplantation,
 the kidney without human transplant should be kept as a negative control.
 3 Fix transplants and kidney tissue in 4% PFA solution overnight at 4 °C.
 4 Dehydrate and parafﬁnize samples according to standard histological procedures.
 5 Cut 2- to 5-μm sections with a standard cryostat and collect them on Ultra Plus slides.
 6 Perform standard de-parafﬁnization procedures.
 7 Follow Steps 39–45 of the Procedure to stain organoids.
 8 Carefully remove all PBS from the slides with a cellulose wipe.
 9 Add a few drops of mounting medium and lay a coverslip on top. Avoid air bubbles.
 10 Dry overnight in the dark at room temperature.
 11 The next day, seal the slide with nail polish.
 12 Proceed to Step 47 of the Procedure to image organoids.


 and 100 ng/mL FGF-2. Around 4 d later (d15), blood vessel organoids should show a
 round and fully encapsulated morphology (Fig. 2k–m).
 CRITICAL STEP Prolonged culture of multiple blood vessel organoids together in one
 c


 well will lead to fusion of organoids. If fusion occurs early in culture, vascular organoids
 can still be separated with two P200 tips.
 (vi) Proceed to ﬁx and analyze the vascular organoids as described in the next step. Once
 conﬁdent the differentiation efﬁciency is adequate (by assessing CD31 and PDGRF-β stainings
 in a whole-mount staining protocol or by FACS analysis), you can also transplant blood vessel
 organoids into the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice as described in Box 1.
 CRITICAL STEP Blood vessel organoids are generally quite resistant to mechanical stress.
 c


 Blood vessel organoids that tend to fall apart during the transplantation process are generally
 of poor quality and should be checked again for viable endothelial cells and pericytes.
 (vii) Transfer blood vessel organoids to a 2-mL Eppendorf tube using a P1000 pipette with
 a cut tip.
 CRITICAL STEP A maximum of ~60 blood vessel organoids can be processed in the same
 c


 tube. Loss of blood vessel organoids during the preparation procedure is not expected.
 (viii) Remove the medium carefully and add 4% PFA in PBS and leave the tube for 1 h at room
 temperature.
 (ix) Remove the PFA solution and add PBS.
 PAUSE POINT Fixed blood vessel organoids can be kept in PBS in the refrigerator for up
 j


 to 1 month.

 Staining of vascular networks and organoids ● Timing 2 d
 39 Add blocking buffer to permeabilize/block the vascular networks/blood vessel organoids/slides for
 2 h at room temperature. For blood vascular networks/blood vessel organoids, add 2 mL of blocking
 buffer per tube and rock tube rack (placed vertically on an orbital shaker) for proper blocking/
 permeabilization. For slides, encircle the tissue with a liquid blocker pen and add 50–100 μL of
 blocking buffer and incubate in a wet chamber.
 40 Remove the blocking buffer and add 50–100 μL of primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer
 (Table 1). Incubate vessel networks/organoids in an upright position on a rocking shaker at 4 °C
 overnight. For sections, incubate in a wet chamber at 4°C overnight.
 41 On the next day, wash the samples three times for 10–15 min in PBS-T solution. For vessel
 networks/organoids, place the tube rack vertically on an orbital shaker for washing.
 42 Add secondary ﬂuorescent antibody (Table 1) in blocking buffer and incubate for 2 h at room
 temperature.
 43 Wash the samples two times for 10–15 min in PBS-T solution.
 44 Add DAPI solution (1:1,000 in PBS) and incubate for 10–15 min.
 45 Wash samples in PBS for 10–15 min.

 Mounting of vascular networks and blood vessel organoids
 46 Mount the samples as described in option A for vascular networks or option B for blood vessel
 organoids grown in vitro.
 (A) Mounting of vascular networks ● Timing 2 d
 (i) Transfer one gel fragment to a 22 × 50-mm coverslip and remove the PBS with a cellulose
 wipe. Be careful not to touch the gel with the cellulose wipe.
 (ii) Add a few drops of mounting medium.
 (iii) Place another 22 × 50-mm coverslip on top and squeeze the gel gently. Avoid moving the
 gel out of the coverslip sandwich.
 (iv) Carefully lay coverslips on a piece of Paraﬁlm to avoid adhesion of coverslips to the surface.
 Store coverslips in the dark and dry overnight at room temperature.
 (v) On the next day, the whole coverslip area should be covered by the mounting medium. Use
 nail polish for sealing.
 (B) Mounting of blood vessel organoids ● Timing 2 d
 (i) Glue iSpacers onto one 22 × 50-mm coverslip.
 (ii) Use a P1000 pipette (cut tip) to pipette organoids into molds, and completely remove the
 PBS with a P200 pipette.
 (iii) Add drops of mounting medium and distribute the organoids with a P200 pipette tip.
 (iv) Carefully lay second 22 × 50-mm coverslip on top, remove excess mounting medium and
 dry it in the dark overnight at room temperature.
 (v) On the next day, use nail polish for sealing.


 Confocal imaging of vascular networks/blood vessel organoids ● Timing ~2–6 h
 47 For generating overview images of vascular networks and whole blood vessel organoids (Fig. 2a,e),
 we recommend using a confocal microscope with a 10× objective. For visualization of endothelial-
 cell–pericyte interaction (Fig. 2f,g), we recommend using a 20× objective, and for imaging vascular
 lumen (Fig. 3d) or ﬁlopodia structures (Fig. 3c, right panel), we suggest using a 63× objective.
 z-stacks should be acquired with a z-resolution for proper Nyquist sampling (e.g., enable optimal
 z-sectioning when using ZEN software).

Anticipated results
 This protocol describes the generation of blood vessel organoids from hPSCs and the subsequent
 analysis. Successful differentiation of hPSCs will result in a dense 3D endothelial network that is
 tightly covered by pericytes and surrounded by a common basement membrane. We have success-
 fully generated blood vessel organoids from various human iPSCs, as well as from human ESCs
 (H9 cell line)15.
 The ﬁrst step of the protocol is to successfully generate stable hPSC aggregates that are
 >50–100 μm in size and show a clear border (Fig. 2b). Mesoderm and, subsequently, vascular
 differentiation are induced in suspension culture. Cell aggregates are embedded at d5 of the protocol
 (Fig. 2c), and the ﬁrst vessel sprouts should appear at d6 and d7. At d8, aggregates should display
 extensive radial sprouting and the dense center of the embedded aggregate should disappear (Fig. 2d).
 Successful differentiation will lead to 30–35% endothelial cells (CD31+VE-Cadherin+) and 60–65%
 pericytes (PDGFR-β+)15. At d10, the vascular networks still expand and can be used to generate
 single blood vessel organoids that will be ready for analysis or transplantation at d15 (Fig. 2f–m).
 Whole-mount immunoﬂuorescence (Steps 38–47) is best suited to preserving 3D blood vessel
 architecture. Vascular networks at d10 will exhibit a highly branched and connected CD31+ endo-
 thelial network that is covered by PDGFR-β+ pericytes (Fig. 3a). A collagen type IV+ (Col IV+)
 basement membrane envelopes those vessels (Fig. 3a,b). At the periphery of the sprouting vascular
 networks, active angiogenesis occurs (angiogenic front) and endothelial cells display prototypical tip
 cell morphology, characterized by excessive formation of CD31+ ﬁlopodia (Fig. 3c). At this stage,
 differentiated vessels will already show the formation of lumen lined by endothelial cells (Fig. 3d).
 From these vascular networks, we isolate single blood vessel organoids that will show the fully
 encapsulated morphology at d15. Blood vessel organoids maintain the generated endothelial networks
 and are highly covered with PDGFR-β+ and SMA+ pericytes (Fig. 3e–g).
 The established blood vessel organoids can be cultured in 96-well plates and thus allow for drug-
 screening approaches. Moreover, blood vessel organoids are more stable against mechanical stress

 than the initial vascular networks in 3D gels and can be used for standard immunohistochemistry
 applications and for transplantation into mice.
 The transplantation of blood vessel organoids into immunocompromised mice (Fig. 4a, inset)
 establishes a stable human vasculature within ~4 weeks after transfer that can be visualized by
 human-speciﬁc anti-CD31 immunostaining (Fig. 4a,b). Reporter line experiments showed that >90%
 of the mural cells that cover the human endothelium are also of human origin15. Intravenous
 injections of ﬂuorophore-conjugated anti-human CD31 antibodies or ﬂuorescently labeled dextran
 conﬁrm vessel perfusion and thus connection of PSC-derived human vessels with the blood vessels of
 the host (Fig. 4c,d). Such functional connections and functional blood ﬂow were conﬁrmed in our
 previous study using real-time MRI15 (not described for the current protocol). Permeability mea-
 surements can be performed by assessing leakage of 70-kDa dextran from human CD31+ blood
 vessels. At later stages, vascular organoids, in addition to generating capillaries (Fig. 4e), further
 specify into arterioles (Fig. 4f) and venules (Fig. 4g). Those vessels exhibit the typical expression of
 markers such as Dll4 and EphrinB2 (arterial) or CoupTF2 and EphB4 (venous)15. At later stages
 (>3 months after transplantation), we do observe invasion of human endothelial cells into the mouse
 kidney. To control for human speciﬁcity of antibodies, it is best to use a kidney that has not been
 transplanted with human tissue and will not stain positive for human-speciﬁc anti-CD31 antibodies
 (Fig. 4h).
