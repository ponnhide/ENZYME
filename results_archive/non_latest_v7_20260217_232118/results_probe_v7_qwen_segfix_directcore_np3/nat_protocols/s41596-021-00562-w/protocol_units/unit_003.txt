19 Prepare colon organoid growth medium (15 ml for every 24-well plate) by ﬁrst making up base medium, as described in Table 2, and then using this as a component of colon organoid growth medium, made as described in Table 3.
20 Collect organoid droplets using the medium in which they are currently growing. Using a 1,000 µl pipette, set the pipette to 650 µl (there should be a maximum volume in each well of 50 µl Matrigel and 600 µl medium). Scrape the bottom of the well with the pipette tip to dislodge the Matrigel droplets.
21 Transfer the medium containing the Matrigel droplets to a 15 ml conical tube. Repeat for all wells, for a total of 12 ml medium per 24-well plate of organoid droplets collected.
22 Aspirate the supernatant (spent organoid growth medium) with vacuum using a sterile Pasteur pipette.
23 Resuspend the Matrigel pellet in CRS using a 1:10 dilution. For a full 24-well plate of organoids, use 12 ml of CRS. Resuspend the Matrigel droplet by gently inverting the 15 ml conical tube.
CRITICAL Do not resuspend the droplet by repeated pipetting as organoid will adhere to the serological pipette and there might be some organoid loss.
c
24 Incubate the resuspended Matrigel in the ice bucket for 45–60 min, or until Matrigel is dissolved. Mix the Matrigel–CRS solution via gentle inversion every 10–15 min. Organoids will settle at the bottom of the tube when Matrigel is fully dissolved.
CRITICAL Do not exceed 60 min of incubation as this can decrease cell viability. Do not vortex the organoid suspension.
c
25 Centrifuge at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, there should be a noticeable organoid pellet, ~200 µl volume of organoid, depending on the density of the original culture.
26 Aspirate CRS using vacuum and a sterile Pasteur pipette. After aspiration, place the conical tube into the glass dish containing ice.
CRITICAL Remove the CRS as much as possible, as remaining CRS could decrease the cell viability and compromise the integrity of the Matrigel matrix.
c
27 Calculate the volume needed for the desired splitting ratio allowing 50 μl of Matrigel per well (i.e., 1.2 ml Matrigel per 24-well plate).
28 Keep the tube on ice, and resuspend the organoid pellet in a maximum of 1 ml of Matrigel. If the total volume required is <1 ml, add the required volume; for example, if 900 µl is needed to achieve the desired splitting ratio, add 900 µl.
CRITICAL Initially, 1 ml is added since a larger volume makes it harder to dissociate the organoids and leads to a more diverse organoid fragment size.
c
29 Bend a 1,000 µl pipette tip by pressing down the pipette tip on the inside of the cap for the conical tube.
30 Once organoids have been fragmented, add the remaining Matrigel needed (calculated in Step 27) to achieve the desired passaging ratio. Mix the Matrigel–organoid fragment suspension well before proceeding to the next step.
