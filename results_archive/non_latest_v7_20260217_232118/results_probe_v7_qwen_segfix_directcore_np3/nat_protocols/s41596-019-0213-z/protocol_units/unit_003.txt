18 Calculate the number of wells of a 12-well plate needed for aggregate embedding. We embed one
full 6-well plate of aggregates in one entire 12-well plate. This usually corresponds to 40–60
aggregates per well.
CRITICAL STEP The density of aggregates per well is important. Too dense seeding will lead to
excessive fusion of blood vessel networks, which makes the analysis and proceeding further with the
protocol difﬁcult. By contrast, too sparse seeding will result in inefﬁcient vascular network
formation.
19 Calculate the total amount of collagen I–Matrigel solution needed. We use 1 mL per well (in total;
0.5 mL per well for layer 1 + 0.5 mL per well for layer 2, e.g., one entire 12-well plate will require
12 mL of collagen I–Matrigel solution: 6 mL for layer 1 (4.5 mL of collagen I solution + 1.5 mL of
Matrigel) + 6 mL (4.5 mL of collagen I solution + 1.5 mL of Matrigel) for layer 2).
20 Thaw the required Matrigel aliquots on ice.
21 Pipette the collagen I solution as described above. Carefully mix by pipetting up and down after
adding PureCol.
22 Pipette the exact amount of collagen I solution into a fresh 15-mL Falcon tube and place it on ice.
23 Add Matrigel to collagen I solution and mix thoroughly by carefully pipetting up and down.
24 Add 0.5 mL of collagen I/Matrigel solution per 12-well plate and swirl the plate equally to distribute
the solution in the wells.
25 Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 2 h for solidiﬁcation.

26 Pipette the aggregates into 15-mL tubes with a 10-mL serological pipette. Collect aggregates by
gravitation.
27 Wash the aggregates by aspirating the supernatant and adding 1 mL of StemPro-34 SFM complete
medium. Repeat the wash once.
28 Use a P200 pipette to aspirate the medium; remove all remaining medium carefully.
29 For the second layer, add PureCol to prepare complete collagen I solution.
30 Prepare the collagen I–Matrigel solution and keep on ice.
31 Resuspend the aggregates in collagen I–Matrigel solution and keep on ice.
32 Remove the 12-well plate containing the ﬁrst layer of collagen I–Matrigel from the incubator
carefully add 0.5 mL of cell aggregate–collagen I–Matrigel solution to each well of the
12-well plate.
33 Distribute the aggregates in the wells by rocking the plate back and forth. Once the aggregates are
well distributed, slowly move the plate to the incubator.
CRITICAL STEP The aggregates should be well distributed within the wells to avoid fusion of
aggregates.
CRITICAL STEP Once the collagen I–Matrigel solution is at room temperature, the polymeriza-
tion process will start. Do not rock the plate for longer than 30 s–1 min to avoid disturbing the
solidiﬁcation process.
34 Incubate the 12-well plate for 2 h at 37 °C for gel solidiﬁcation.
