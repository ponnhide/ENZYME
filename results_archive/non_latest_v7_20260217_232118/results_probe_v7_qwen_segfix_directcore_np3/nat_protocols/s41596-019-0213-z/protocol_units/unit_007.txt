46 Mount the samples as described in option A for vascular networks or option B for blood vessel
organoids grown in vitro.
(A) Mounting of vascular networks ● Timing 2 d
(i) Transfer one gel fragment to a 22 × 50-mm coverslip and remove the PBS with a cellulose
wipe. Be careful not to touch the gel with the cellulose wipe.
(ii) Add a few drops of mounting medium.
(iii) Place another 22 × 50-mm coverslip on top and squeeze the gel gently. Avoid moving the
gel out of the coverslip sandwich.
(iv) Carefully lay coverslips on a piece of Paraﬁlm to avoid adhesion of coverslips to the surface.
Store coverslips in the dark at 4 °C.
(B) Mounting of blood vessel organoids ● Timing 2 d
(i) Glue iSpacers onto one 22 × 50-mm coverslip.
(ii) Use a P1000 pipette (cut tip) to pipette organoids into molds, and completely remove the
PBS with a P200 pipette.
(iii) Add drops of mounting medium and distribute the organoids with a P200 pipette tip.
(iv) Carefully lay second 22 × 50-mm coverslip on top, remove excess mounting medium and
dry it in the dark overnight at room temperature.
(v) On the next day, use nail polish for sealing.
47 For generating overview images of vascular networks and whole blood vessel organoids, use a
confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM 780) with a 10×, 20× or 63× objective and ZEN software.
