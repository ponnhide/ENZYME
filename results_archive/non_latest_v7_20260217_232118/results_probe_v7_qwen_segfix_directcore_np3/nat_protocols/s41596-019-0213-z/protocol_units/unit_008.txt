Box 1 | Transplantation of blood vessel organoids ● Timing 4 d (8–12 weeks after
transplantation)
1 Transplant blood vessel organoids under the kidney capsule of immunocompromised NOD/SCID/IL2Rγnull mice.
CRITICAL STEP Inefﬁcient differentiation could lead to teratoma formation in mice.
2 Sacriﬁce mice and collect transplanted blood vessel organoids. If only one kidney is used for transplantation,
the kidney without human transplant should be kept as a negative control.
3 Fix transplants and kidney tissue in 4% PFA solution overnight at 4 °C.
4 Dehydrate and parafﬁnize samples according to standard histological procedures.
5 Cut 2- to 5-μm sections with a standard cryostat and collect them on Ultra Plus slides.
6 Perform standard de-parafﬁnization procedures.
7 Follow Steps 39–45 of the Procedure to stain organoids.
8 Carefully remove all PBS from the slides with a cellulose wipe.
9 Add a few drops of mounting medium and lay a coverslip on top. Avoid air bubbles.
10 Dry overnight in the dark at room temperature.
11 The next day, seal the slide with nail polish.
12 Proceed to Step 47 of the Procedure to image organoids.
