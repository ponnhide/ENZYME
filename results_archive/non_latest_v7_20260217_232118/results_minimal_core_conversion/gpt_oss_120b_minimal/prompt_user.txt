Unit title: Colony genotyping PCR (abstract, non-operational)

Protocol text:
Inspect a colony plate and select a candidate colony for genotype checking.
Move the selected colony into a labeled sample container.
Prepare a crude template extract from the colony material using your institution's approved workflow.
Prepare a PCR reaction mix for genotype-specific amplification.
Combine reaction mix, primer set, and colony-derived template in a PCR tube.
Run a thermocycling program appropriate for the genotype assay design.
Perform amplicon readout using an approved detection method.
Compare observed signal patterns against expected assay signatures.
Record the genotype call and mark uncertain outcomes for confirmatory follow-up.
