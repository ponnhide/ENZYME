30. Aspirate the CDBLY2 medium from each well of differentiated hPSC, wash with 1 mL/well of room temperature TrypLE Select, then aspirate and replace with a fresh 1 mL of TrypLE Select.
31. Incubate plate at 37 °C for 3 min.
32. While the cells are incubating, place 1 mL of room temperature E6 containing 2% FBS into a 15 mL conical tube (one tube for every three or four wells of a 12-well plate).
33. Gently detach the cells from the well surface by pipetting up and down a maximum of six times using a P1000 pipette, dissociating to a single-cell suspension.
34. Transfer the cells in TrypLE Select to the 15 mL conical tube containing E6/2% FBS.
35. Rinse the wells with an additional 1 mL of E6/2% FBS to collect any residual cells and add to the same conical tube.
36. Top-up the conical tube volume to 5 mL with E6/2% FBS and centrifuge the tube at 300g for 3 min.
37. Aspirate the supernatant and gently flick the tube three times to dislodge the cell pellet.
38. Resuspend the cell pellet to a final volume of 2 mL of E6/2% FBS final volume, adding the medium gradually with a P1000 pipette and gently triturating the pellet during medium addition to resuspend to a single-cell suspension using minimal pipetting.
