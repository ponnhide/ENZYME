41. Top up the medium volume in each tube to 200 µL with E6/2% FBS.
42. Centrifuge tubes three times at 300g for 3 min, rotating the tubes 180° between each centrifugation step.
43. Following the third centrifugation, use a P200 pipette with a wide-bore tip to gently push each cell pellet down to the base of the tube and aspirate the micromass into the pipette tip opening.
44. Transfer three micromasses to each Transwell insert, working swiftly without delay. Ensure minimal medium carryover by allowing each micromass to settle into the pipette tip opening before dispensing in a single droplet that is touched onto the Transwell membrane.
