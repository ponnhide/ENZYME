51. For fixation, aspirate medium from the base of the transwell and replace with 1 mL per well of cold 4% PFA, also adding one drop of PFA on top of each organoid. Incubate the plate for 30 min at 4 °C, then remove PFA using a P1000 pipette and discard in the appropriate PFA waste container. Wash three times with PBS, 10 min per wash in the same manner as fixation, adding 1 mL of PBS to the basolateral Transwell compartment and one drop on top of each organoid.
52. After the final wash, add 1 mL of sterile PBS to the Transwell basolateral compartment and seal the plate with parafilm for short‑term storage.
