Add 20–30 µl/well of 100% Matrigel (Phenol Red–Free) on ice to the fused A-P spheroid in a 1.5-ml tube. Gently re-suspend the single A-P spheroid by using a mechanical pipette with a wide-bore 200-µl tip and slowly plate it on a 24-well tissue culture plate (VWR International) to make a Matrigel drop. Incubate the drop in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 5 min. Flip the plate upside down and incubate for a further 5 min to prevent the spheroid from attaching to the bottom. Add enough gut growth medium to cover the entire drop and culture for 4 d to generate HBPOs.
