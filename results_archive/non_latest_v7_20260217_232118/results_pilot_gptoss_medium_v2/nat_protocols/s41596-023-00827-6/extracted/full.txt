 Organoids have been an exciting advancement in stem cell research. Here we describe a strategy for directed
 differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into distal lung organoids. This protocol recapitulates lung development by
 sequentially specifying human pluripotent stem cells to deﬁnitive endoderm, anterior foregut endoderm, ventral anterior
 foregut endoderm, lung bud organoids and ﬁnally lung organoids. The organoids take ~40 d to generate and can be
 maintained more than 180 d, while progressively maturing up to a stage consistent with the second trimester of human
 gestation. They are unique because of their branching morphology, the near absence of non-lung endodermal lineages,

 presence of mesenchyme and capacity to recapitulate interstitial lung diseases. This protocol can be performed by anyone
 familiar with cell culture techniques, is conducted in serum-free conditions and does not require lineage-speciﬁc reporters
 or enrichment steps. We also provide a protocol for the generation of single-cell suspensions for single-cell RNA
 sequencing.


 Introduction
 Organoids are used to study human development and to model disease1,2. Among others, major
 progress has been made in the generation of lung organoids3,4. The lung epithelium contains multiple
 cell types, including basal, ciliated, secretory, goblet and neuroendocrine cells in the airways, and
 alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) and surfactant-producing alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells in the
 alveoli, where gas exchange takes place4,5. In addition, several novel transitional cell populations have
 been identiﬁed in the human distal lung respiratory airway or terminal respiratory bronchioles, very
 small airways in which alveoli empty and that contain more extensive alveoli at their distal tips6–8.
 The respiratory system originates from buds that arise on the ventral aspect of the anterior foregut
 endoderm (AFE) during embryonic stage (E9.5–E12.5 in the mouse, 4–7 post-conception weeks
 (pcw) in humans). These undergo a stereotyped branching process during the pseudoglandular stage
 (E12.5–E16.5 in the mouse, 5–17 pcw in humans). During the canalicular stage (E16.5–E17.5 in the
 mouse, 16–26 pcw in humans) cell cycle activity decreases and specialization of the airway epithelium
 occurs in the stalks, with the emergence of basal, goblet, club, ciliated and other cell types. This stage
 is followed by the saccular stage, where the canaliculi widen into sacculations that will give rise to
 primitive alveoli (E17.5 to birth in the mouse, 26–38 pcw in humans)5,9–11. Expansion of alveolar
 number by further differentiation of immature saccules, alveolar maturation and secondary septation
 continue predominantly postnatally (alveolar stage, postnatal days 0–21 (d0–21) in mice, 38 pcw to
 the age of 21 years in humans)11,12. Generating organoids that at least partially model human lung
 development requires recapitulating this process to the extent possible in vitro.

 Since the ﬁrst reports on their establishment from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)13,14,
 several publications showed the generation of lung organoids, either from fetal or adult lung15–18 or
 from hPSCs19–26. We developed a directed differentiation strategy of hPSCs (both embryonic stem
 cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)) into three-dimensional (3D) lung organoids
 that undergo a process similar to branching morphogenesis and that we have used to model ﬁbrotic
 interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) and viral infection20,27,28.
 This protocol (Fig. 1a) begins by replicating early lung development through successive speciﬁ-
 cation of deﬁnitive endoderm (DE) and AFE according to protocols we established previously
 (Fig. 1b, i–iii, d4.3, d6.3)20,29,30. Subsequently, small organoids that are endowed with the expression
 patterns associated with lung buds in vivo (hence the name ‘lung bud organoids’ or LBOs, Fig. 1b,
 iv–vi, d8, d9, d15) are generated in suspension culture20. These LBOs can give rise to lung and airway
 structures after transplantation under the kidney capsule of immunodeﬁcient mice or can be
 embedded in Matrigel20, where a process similar to branching morphogenesis ensues and organoids
 arise that expand more than 6 months (Fig. 1b, vii, viii, d42, d70). Genome-wide expression analysis
 and benchmarking against the Keygenes database31, which contains tissues from the ﬁrst and second
 trimester of human gestation and of adult humans, revealed that organoids at d170 corresponded best
 to lung in the second trimester of human gestation20. At these later stages of the cultures, AT2 cells
 arise at the tips. These contain lamellar bodies (LBs) by transmission electron microscopy and can
 take up and secrete ﬂuorescently labeled surfactant protein B (SFTPB)20, features speciﬁc to AT2 cells.
 Mesenchyme appears during the anteriorization and ventralization stages and becomes scarce after
 development in Matrigel20. This may correspond to the attrition of mesenchyme during lung
 development32.

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 Applications of the method
 The most unique feature of the organoids described here is the presence of mesenchyme that allows
 studies of epithelial–mesenchymal interactions and therefore recapitulation and modeling of at least
 some ILDs. ILDs are a heterogeneous group of entities with diverse or unknown etiologies affecting
 the lung interstitium33. Development of pulmonary ﬁbrosis (PF), most commonly associated with
 idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis (IPF), portends the worst prognosis33,34. Injury to AT2 cells probably
 plays a critical role in the development of both familial and sporadic IPF, as mutations causing
 familial IPF speciﬁcally affect AT2 function, while depletion of AT2 cells in mouse models is asso-
 ciated with ﬁbrosis35. In addition, a fraction of patients with familial IPF have heterozygous muta-
 tions in telomerase components or other genes involved in telomere maintenance36–43. Furthermore,
 several susceptibility loci have been identiﬁed that affect telomere length44. As telomeropathy affects
 stem cell function and AT2 cells are facultative distal lung stem cells4,45, these associations suggest a
 role for AT2 cells.
 Finding therapeutic targets and novel drug treatments requires models to dissect pathogenetic
 mechanisms, identify biomarkers, discover drug targets and perform drug testing. It has been chal-
 lenging to model ILDs in animal models34,35,46–48. A complementary, more malleable, but also more
 reductionist avenue are lung organoids derived from hPSCs. We showed that PF caused by mutation
 in Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome (HPS) genes could be modeled28. HPS is a genetic syndrome caused
 by abnormal biogenesis and trafﬁcking of lysosome-related organelles and characterized by hypo-
 pigmentation, bleeding diathesis and in some but not all genotypes, PF, also known as HPS-associated
 interstitial pneumonia (HPSIP). Fibrosis in HPSIP is most probably linked to the fact that home-
 ostasis of LBs in AT2 cells is abnormal and surfactant secretion is reduced, as LBs are also lysosome-
 related organelles49. Of the nine genotypes, only three (HPS1, 2 and 4) are clinically associated with
 HPSIP. Accordingly, we found that only organoids derived from ESCs with mutation in HPS1, 2 or
 4 showed ﬁbrotic changes, whereas organoids with a mutation in HPS8, which is clinically not
 associated with ﬁbrosis, did not28. This model therefore recapitulates the clinical incidence of PF in
 HPS. By comparing genome-wide expression data from epithelial cells isolated from lung organoids
 generated from the ﬁbrosis prone (HPS1−/− and HPS2−/−) and non-ﬁbrosis-prone (HPS8−/−)
 mutants, we furthermore identiﬁed interleukin-11 as a therapeutic target critical to ﬁbrosis. This
 provides proof-of-principle evidence that pathogenetic mechanism and therapeutic targets can be
 identiﬁed using lung organoids with mutations associated with diseases28.
 The organoids can also be used to model viral infection. They can be infected by respiratory
 viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainﬂuenza and measles. We showed that the organoids
 are authentic infection models that do not promote the emergence of culture-adapted variants in the
 propagation of parainﬂuenza27. In the case of respiratory syncytial virus, we could show that infected
 epithelial cells are dislodged into the lumen, as is observed in bronchiolitis caused by this virus49.
 The organoids can also be used for modeling human lung development. As an example, single-cell
 RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and confocal analysis is presented in the ‘Anticipated results’ section,
 showing progressive loss of other endodermal fates present early in organoid development, and
 reciprocal acquisition of a distal lung fate. This model can therefore be used to examine relevant
 signaling pathways as well as transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the progressive speciﬁcation
 of distal lung. The fact that undifferentiated endoderm remains present in organoids early in
 development suggests that it is possible that by changing the culture conditions, other endodermal
 fates could be obtained, which may constitute another potential application of this model. The
 spontaneous formation of branching structures also suggest that this model could be used to study
 branching morphogenesis in the lung.


 Comparison with other methods
 Since the ﬁrst reports on their establishment from hPSCs13,14, several publications showed the
 generation of lung organoids, either from fetal or adult lung15–18 or from hPSCs19–26. In many cases,
 the structures are limited in size or contain, often by design, speciﬁc cell types (airway23,26,50 or AT2
 cells19,24,51). The lung organoids described here present several unique features compared with others
 as a model of human distal lung development.

 Branching morphogenesis
 A ﬁrst feature is that they undergo a process similar to branching morphogenesis and that the full
 potential to generate lung and airways is present in the early organoids. While differentiation is biased

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 toward distal lung in the conditions we use in vitro (described here in this protocol), the early-stage
 lung organoids (LBOs in suspension) generate structures containing branching tubules with prox-
 imodistal speciﬁcation when embedded in donor-derived mesenchyme after transplantation under the
 kidney capsule of immunodeﬁcient mice20. Another group (the protocol described in Miller et al.22)
 also reported generation of 3D human lung organoids from hPSCs13,14. While these smaller structures
 contained cells expressing markers of lung and airway14 and have some airway potential after sub-
 cutaneous xenografting in mice13, they did not show branching structures. However, these organoids
 were similar to our reported organoids, staged as early fetal lung22.

 Pulmonary mesenchyme
 Another notable feature of the distal lung organoids described here is the presence of mesenchyme,
 the origin of which is unclear. Mesenchyme could already be detected during the AFE stage of the
 protocol, remains present and relatively abundant during the LBO (suspension) stage, and becomes
 scarce, but still detectable after development to at least d60 in Matrigel20. The mesenchymal cells can
 be isolated by cell sorting for EPCAM−THY+ cells28. RNAseq20 as well as scRNAseq (see ‘Anticipated
 results’) showed that this mesenchyme expresses genes associated with pulmonary mesenchyme
 (including WTN2B52 and TBX4 (ref. 53)). The presence of mesenchyme is shared with the protocol
 of Miller et al., although they did not further characterize the mesenchyme22. The presence of
 mesenchyme in our organoids may explain what is probably the most unique application of these
 organoids, the capacity to recapitulate at least one ILDs: HPSIP. Together, these ﬁndings indicate that
 these distal lung organoids can represent an integrated model of distal lung development and disease.

 Differentiation efﬁciency
 A ﬁnal distinguishing feature of the organoids described here is that any intervening puriﬁcation steps
 are unnecessary. The in vitro generation of NKX2.1+ lung progenitors with high efﬁciency is a critical
 but challenging step. To resolve this issue, several groups have developed strategies based on lineage-
 speciﬁc reporters to isolate these before further differentiation and maturation. In two reports from
 the same laboratory, McCauley et al.54 speciﬁed lung progenitors, and isolated NKX2.1GFP+ cells at
 d15 for further culture in Matrigel 3D medium to yield proximal airway spheroids devoid of distal
 potential, while Jacob et al.19 resorted to a NKX2.1GFPSFTPCtdTomato reporter cell line to isolate
 NKX2.1GFP+SFTPCtdTomato+ cells for further culture in Matrigel to generate spheroids containing
 AT2 cells. While these protocols are advantageous when differentiation efﬁciency is modest, they only
 allow for studies using these speciﬁc reporter lines. To resolve this problem, surface markers were
 identiﬁed by which NKX2.1+ lung progenitors can be isolated from the cultures. Gotoh et al. reported
 carboxypeptidase M (CPM) as a speciﬁc marker of NKX2.1+ progenitors24, which was then used by
 Konishi et al.26 to select for NKX2.1+ cells. Hawkins et al. used differential expression of CD47 and
 CD26 to show that CD47hiCD26lo cells are enriched in NKX2.1+ lung progenitors55. However, a
 rigorous head-to-head comparison with reporter lines has not been performed.
 The reasons why neither reporter cells nor cell sorting are required in our protocol are unclear. We
 speculate that some differences in our protocol may offer an explanation. We grow hPSCs in the
 presence of feeders, as we have found that passage in feeder-free conditions compromises future lung
 potential. Second, although commercial kits to generate DE have been recommended and are widely
 used56, we found that, while DE generation was indeed efﬁcient, the lung potential of the DE
 generated was suboptimal. We therefore adhere to a strict protocol to generate DE using reagents that
 have to be lot tested. We also generate DE in 3D embryoid bodies, and not in two-dimensional (2D)
 cultures. Finally, the LBO suspension culture step may select for cells speciﬁed to pulmonary epi-
 thelium and mesenchyme. The same may be true for the Matrigel step. Indeed, scRNAseq analysis
 suggests progressive acquisition of a distal lung at the expense of other endodermal fates over the ﬁrst
 80 d of the protocol (see ‘Anticipated results’).

 A serum-free model
 The published protocol that is the most closely related to the protocol described here was by Miller et al.22.
 However, the factors used in the latter differ from ours. In the speciﬁcation of AFE they also use, in
 addition to BMP and TGF-β inhibition, Wnt agonism, FGF4 and Smoothened agonist. They do not
 include an extended period of suspension culture (which in the protocol described here generates
 LBOs). Furthermore, and importantly, they use fetal bovine serum (FBS) in their base medium, which
 we try to avoid as this is an uncharacterized reagent. Miller et al. do obtain proximal and some distal
 lung speciﬁcation in the presence of serum, and in conditions similar to ours (but without BMP4 and

 FGF10) they obtain small spherical ‘bud tip’ organoids. The organoids we describe here do not
 develop in the presence of serum (Fig. 2).

 Development and disease modeling
 As mentioned before, the organoids of Miller et al. are much smaller and do not show branching.
 Commonalities between both types of organoids are the capacity to generate lung and airway
 structures after transplantation under the kidney capsule of immunodeﬁcient mice, the presence of
 mesenchyme and the fact that repeated enrichment steps are not required. In contrast to the current
 protocol, that of Miller et al. has not been reported to be useful in modeling ILDs, and was not
 reported to be infectable by the viruses we used20,27. Both models will probably serve complementary
 goals. The capacity to generate airway cells in the protocol of Miller et al., for example, may allow
 studies on airway development and proximodistal speciﬁcation, whereas the organoids reported here
 will allow investigation of branching morphogenesis and alveolar speciﬁcation, in addition to
 modeling ILDs.
 We have also previously reported on a protocol in Collagen I (Col I) gels that allows further
 maturation of lung cells in 3D21,57. This Col I protocol and the resulting organoids are distinct
 from the protocol described here. Rather than generating 3D LBOs in suspension culture, the Col I
 protocol continues lung progenitor speciﬁcation in 2D, followed by plating into Col I gels. The
 Col I model is, in contrast to the organoids described here, permissive for the speciﬁcation of all distal
 and airway lineages after retraction of CHIR99021 (CHIR), including cells compatible with AT1 cells.
 This ﬁnding is consistent with the observations of Kanagaki et al. in ﬁbroblast-dependent alveolar
 organoids58. However, retraction of CHIR in the distal lung organoids described here results in cell
 death and disintegration. In vitro, we were therefore not able to achieve induction of AT1 markers in
 lung organoids generated using the protocol described here. However, we do note that after trans-
 plantation under the kidney capsule, LBOs could generate cells expressing AT1 markers20, suggesting
 that the potential exists, but that the correct in vitro conditions for AT1 generation have not yet been
 identiﬁed for these organoids.
 In addition, while in most studies the maturity of the generated cells goes unreported or is
 equivalent to the second trimester of human gestation21, the cells generated by our Col I protocol
 exhibit transcriptomic proﬁles, ultrastructure and an array of lineage-speciﬁc markers that also
 partially match postnatal lungs21. Several mature cell types can be isolated using surface markers.
 Most notably, the Col I protocol allowed the generation NGFR+ basal cells, the stem cells of the
 postnatal airway59, which can be isolated and further expanded using established techniques60. On
 the other hand, and in contrast to the model described here, modeling ﬁbrotic lung disease was not
 possible, and mesenchymal cells were not present. Both models are therefore complementary. The
 reason why both protocols behave differently is most likely linked to differences in the early stages of
 directed differentiation and the different extracellular matrices used to embed the organoids. The
 underlying mechanisms merit further investigation.

 Limitations
 Even after 6 months of culture in Matrigel, the organoid model matches the second trimester of
 human gestation on the basis of genome-wide expression analysis. The expression of SFTPC, a
 marker of mature AT2 cells occurs late in the culture (d170) and is not universal (Fig. 3a), although
 all other AT2 markers studied (SFTPB, ABCA3, LPCAT, NAPSA, SLC34A2) reproducibly and pro-
 gressively increase and are consistently expressed by a majority of the cells by d80 (see ‘Anticipated
 results’). We have previously shown the presence of LBs and capacity to take up and release SFTPB in
 organoids >d120 old, indicating long-term maintenance of still immature AT2 cells20. The

 combination of CHIR, FGF7 and dexamethasone, cAMP and IBMX has been reported to be necessary
 for the expansion and maintenance of so-called alveolospheres generated from hPSC-derived lung
 progenitors. Even here, however, maintaining SFTPC expression was challenging and required
 repeated sorting for a reporter, as well switching the culture conditions between presence and absence
 of CHIR19,56. We also note that in the organoid protocol of Miller et al.22, SFTPC expression was rare.
 Even though we observed a process reminiscent of branching morphogenesis, the branching is not
 well organized. The structures branch randomly in every direction and appeared disorganized,
 probably because neither directional cues nor physical constraints, such as a thoracic cavity, are
 provided. In addition, the exact nature and patterning of the mesenchyme present is unclear and the
 proportion declines along the culture time. The mesenchyme does not have the potential to generate
 endothelial cells in vivo after transplantation under the kidney capsule, although smooth muscle and
 occasional cartilage were present20. Endothelial cells or blood vessels have also not been observed
 in vitro in our model. Furthermore, we could not achieve induction of AT1 markers in vitro, although
 AT1 markers were observed after engraftment in vivo20. Terminal and architecturally fully appro-
 priate maturation of organoids is still a challenge for the ﬁeld in general. Finally, the use of Matrigel to
 embed LBOs and serum to inactive enzymatic activities in this model is still a barrier for translational
 research. The use of Matrigel might be replaced with synthetic hydrogels. However, when LBOs,
 generated using the protocol described here, were embedded in Col I gels, they did not show
 branching (Fig. 4). We do not know whether this is due to the molecular composition or the stiffness
 of Matrigel that allows branching morphogenesis of LBOs. Hence, the choice of 3D medium for
 embedding should take these two factors into consideration. The use of serum to inactivate enzymes
 in the protocol can be easily substituted with puriﬁed protease inhibitors.

 Experimental design
 A schematic of the protocol with examples of the typical morphologies at each stage is shown in Fig. 1.
 We maintain hPSCs on feeder cells. The protocol begins with mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast (MEF)
 depletion (d1, Fig. 1b, i) followed by a stepwise, sequential induction of DE (d0–4, Fig. 1b, ii) and AFE
 (d5–6, Fig. 1b, iii) as previously described20,61. hPSCs are passaged on Matrigel-coated plates to
 deplete residual MEFs for ~24 h (Steps 1–13). After MEF depletion, primitive streak and embryoid
 body induction is performed in embryoid bodies/primitive streak (EB/PS) medium in ultralow-
 attachment plates for 12–16 h (Steps 14–27). This is followed by switching to DE induction medium
 for another 76–80 h (d4; Steps 28–42). Essential in this step is exposure to high concentrations of
 Activin A. DE can be generated both in 2D adherent cultures and or in 3D as EBs in low-attachment
 plates. We found that lung potential is maintained the best in EBs. DE purity is veriﬁed by ﬂow
 cytometry after staining for EPCAM, cKIT and CXCR4 (Steps 43–66)20,61. It is essential that more
 than 90% of the cells express high levels of these three markers. Others have recommended the use of
 commercial kits to generate DE56. We found that while generation of DE was efﬁcient, the potential
 of these DE cells to generate lung and airway cells was more limited.
 High-purity DE (>90%) is directed to AFE via inhibition of TGF-β, BMP and WNT signaling by
 SB 431542, NOGGIN and IWP2, respectively (Steps 67–89)29,30,61. At the end of AFE induction (d6),
 cells are treated with ventralization medium in the presence of BMP4, FGF10, FGF7, all-trans retinoic
 acid (RA) and the glycogen synthase kinase 3β antagonist, CHIR for 48 h (Steps 90–92). At this time,
 formation of loosely adherent clumps can be observed (Fig. 1b, iv). Next, LBOs are generated
 (Steps 93–99). This is accomplished by resuspending clumps of cells at d8 and maintaining those in
 ultra-low-attachment plates in the presence of CHIR, FGF10, FGF7, BMP4 and RA, where they will
 form spheres consisting of folding epithelial sheets interspersed with mesenchymal cells (Fig. 1b, v, vi
 and Fig. 3b). The majority of the epithelial cells will express early, but not mature lung markers, and
 have an expression proﬁle consistent with lung bud epithelium. The mesenchymal cells express
 markers consistent with pulmonary mesenchyme, and can make up 5–20% of the population by ﬂow
 cytometry20.
 In the ﬁnal stage (Steps 100–117), the LBOs are plated in Matrigel with CHIR, FGF10, FGF7,
 BMP4 and RA, where they undergo outward budding followed by a process similar to branching
 morphogenesis (Fig. 1b, vii, viii). Other alternatives can be used, such as Cultrex (R&D Systems),

 to break the Matrigel and collect the content of the insert. Transfer the organoid in trizol into a 1.5 ml tube and vortex until homogenized.
 2 Centrifuge the sample at 16,000g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the residual Matrigel. Take the supernatant and mix with equal amount of 100%
 ethanol and vortex thoroughly.
 3 Transfer the mixture into a Zymo-Spin IC Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30 s at 16,000g. Transfer the column into a new
 collection tube and discard the ﬂow through.
 4 In an RNase-free tube, add 5 μl DNase I (6 U/μl), 35 μl DNA Digestion Buffer and mix by gentle inversion. Add the mix directly to the column
 matrix. Incubate at room temperature (20–30 °C) for 15 min.
 5 Add 400 μl Direct-zol RNA PreWash to the column and centrifuge. Discard the ﬂow through and repeat this step.
 6 Add 700 μl RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 1 min to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Transfer the column
 carefully into an RNase-free tube.
 7 To elute RNA, add 15 μl of DNase-/RNase-free water directly to the column matrix and centrifuge.
 8 Reverse transcribe 100–1,000 ng of total RNA using the qScript XLT cDNA SuperMix. Combine following reagents in 0.2 ml microtubes:


 Component Volume for 20 μl reaction

 qScript XLT cDNA SuperMix 4 μl
 RNA template Variable
 RNase-/DNase-free water Variable
 Total volume 20 μl


 9 After sealing each reaction, vortex gently to mix contents. Centrifuge brieﬂy to collect components at the bottom of the reaction tube.
 10 Incubate as follows: 5 min at 25 °C, 60 min at 42 °C, 5 min at 85 °C, hold at 4 °C. Use ﬁrst-strand product for RT–qPCR ampliﬁcation.
 11 For RT–qPCR, prepare technical triplicates of 15 μl reaction:


 Component Volume for 15 μl reaction

 Sybr green 7.5 μl
 Forward primer (from 0.15 μl
 10 μM stock)
 Reverse primer (from 0.15 μl
 10 μM stock)
 cDNA Variable
 Water Variable
 Total volume 15 μl


 12 Prepare samples in a 384-well plate and run for 40 cycles. Use primers listed in Table 1. Calculate relative gene expression on the basis of the
 average cycle (Ct) value, normalized to GAPDH as the internal control and reported as fold change (2(-ddCT)).

 Procedure
 1 Aspirate the medium and remove the insert from the 24-well plate. Invert it and gently peel off the membrane from the insert using forceps.
 2 Excise the lung organoid and embed in a cryo-mold on dry ice.
 3 Cut frozen samples on a cryotome at the thickness of 10–12 μm and collect on adhesion microscope slides and air dry.
 4 Fix the samples in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, wash two times for 5 min in 50 mM glycine to inactivate the PFA, followed by washing
 in PBS.
 5 Permeabilize samples for 10 min in 0.2% PBST (PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100) and block by incubating in PBS containing 5% donkey serum for 1 h,
 then incubate overnight in primary antibody in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% donkey serum (for primary antibodies and suggested dilutions, see
 Table 1).
 6 The next day, wash the samples three times in PBS and 1% donkey serum and incubate with secondary antibody (1:200) for 1 h at the room
 temperature (for secondary antibodies, see Table 1). Stain nuclei with DAPI (1:500).
 7 Mount sections with Mounting Reagent and coverslip. Slides are ready for the imaging when the mounting reagent dries properly.


 which in our hands gave similar results. We recommend growth factor-reduced Matrigel, as multiple
 factors at various concentrations may otherwise be present that could unpredictably affect organoid
 development, and therefore reproducibility. The mesenchyme is gradually lost after embedding in
 Matrigel. Approximately 90% of LBOs will yield rapidly expanding branching structures in which the
 fraction cells expressing a constellation of AT2 markers gradually increases, such that by d80, these
 form the majority of the cells (see ‘Anticipated results’). The organoids can be maintained in culture
 for more than 6 months. The entire protocol is conducted serum-free conditions.
 We found that several medium constituents need to be lot tested. These include Activin A, N2 and
 B27 medium, and Knockout Serum Replacement (see ‘Reagents’). Lot testing involves comparative
 analysis for maximal efﬁciency of DE generation as evaluated by expression of EPCAM, cKIT and
 CXCR4 by ﬂow cytometry. We found lot testing of Matrigel for organoid formation not necessary.
 The cultures can be analyzed at any step of the differentiation using several approaches, including
 immunoﬂuorescence (IF; Box 1), reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction
 (RT–qPCR; Box 1), electron microscopy, RNAseq and western blot, as we published previously20,27,28.
 We provide an example of IF (Fig. 5, antibodies in Table 1) and RT–qPCR analysis (Fig. 6, primer
 sequences in Table 2). Additionally, the cultures can be analyzed by scRNAseq (Boxes 2 and 3). As
 the quality of the input single-cell suspension is critical to scRNAseq, we provide a protocol to
 generate single-cell suspension from organoids in Matrigel (Box 2). In the ‘Anticipated results’
 section, we provide an example of scRNAseq analysis (Figs. 7 and 8).


 Expertise needed to implement the protocol
 Any scientist with experience in cell culture can apply this protocol. The required equipment, except
 for the low-oxygen incubator and the picking hood, is standard to most cell culture facilities, and
 reagents can be purchased from standard scientiﬁc vendors.

 ● hPSCs: this protocol was developed and optimized for differentiation of RUES2 human ESCs
 (Rockefeller University Embryonic Stem Cell Line 2, National Institutes of Health (NIH) approval
 number NIHhESC-09-0013, registration number 0013; RRID: CVCL_B810, passages 17–28) and has also
 been shown to work with two iPSC lines generated using Sendai Virus and modiﬁed messenger RNA
 from human dermal ﬁbroblasts (purchased from Mount Sinai Stem Cell Core facility, passages 17–26).
 We anticipate that this protocol could also be applied to other hESC and hiPSC lines, although some
 optimization might be required. This optimization is primarily geared at optimal DE induction as
 evaluated by ﬂow cytometry for expression of EPCAM, CXCR4 and cKIT (see Steps 28–66) and may
 require adjusting density of hPSCs and feeders, as well as duration of DE induction (typically ranging
 from 72 to 96 h) ! CAUTION Research involving human ESCs must comply with state, institutional and
 funding agency regulations. An approval from the Human Embryonic and Human Pluripotent Stem Cell
 Committee at the investigator’s home institute is usually required. We obtained approval from the
 Columbia University Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight committee (H.-W.S.) and Mount Sinai
 Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight committee (Y.-W.C.). ! CAUTION Karyotyping is required every
 6 months. ! CAUTION The cell lines used in your research should be regularly checked to ensure they are
 authentic and are not infected with mycoplasma.

 Reagent setup
 ● Base medium: to make 100 ml of base medium, add 0.53 ml of 7.5% BSA to 99.47 ml of IMDM (ﬁnal concentration of BSA 0.04% vol/vol).

 Sterile ﬁlter through a 0.22 μm ﬁlter. Store at 4 °C for 1 month.
 Procedure
 1 Remove the insert from the 24-well plate, invert it and gently peel off the membrane from the bottom of the insert using forceps.
 2 Carefully place the insert with the membrane removed over the mouth of an open, empty 15 ml centrifuge tube.
 3 Add 1 ml of cell recovery reagent to the insert such that the embedded organoid with Matrigel falls into the 15 ml centrifuge tube.
 4 Close the 15 ml centrifuge tube and immediately place on ice to depolymerize the Matrigel.
 5 Every 20 min, gently shake the tube to check if the Matrigel has dissolved and place it back on ice.
 6 Once the Matrigel has dissolved, add 10 ml of wash medium to the tube. Time varies from ~45 min to 1 h depending on Matrigel thickness.
 7 Centrifuge at 200g for 5 min.
 8 Aspirate the wash medium and cell recovery reagent and add 1 ml of Accutase to the organoid and incubate at 37 °C.
 CRITICAL STEP Avoid using trypsin to dissociate the organoid as it is too harsh and the chances of losing fragile cell types is higher.
 c


 9 Gently shake the tube to disturb/dissociate the organoid every 5 min and replace the tube at 37 °C for 10–12 min. Time varies depending on the
 organoid size and density.
 10 When the organoid is dissociated add 10 ml wash medium and centrifuge at 400g for 4 min.
 11 Aspirate the wash medium and resuspend the pellet in base medium.
 CRITICAL STEP Check the base medium compatibility with the sequencing technology to be used for scRNAseq.

 Box 3 scRNAseq | analysis
 For our scRNAseq analysis (see ‘Anticipated results’ and Figs. 7 and 8) libraries were prepared and sequenced at the JP Sulzberger Columbia
 Genome Center High-Throughput Screening Center at Columbia University. Sequencing libraries were prepared using 10x Genomics Single Cell
 Gene Expression 3′ workﬂow and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. FASTQ ﬁles were processed using cell ranger version 5.0.1 for each
 sample and the reads were aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome.
 Data were analyzed using the standardized Seurat pipeline V4 in R65 and reciprocal principal component analysis-based integration (https://satija
 lab.org/seurat/articles/integration_rpca.html). The steps involved in the analysis include: quality control analysis, normalization, integration of
 samples, dimensionality reduction, clustering and visualization of the data65. To begin, the Cell Ranger output count matrix was read into R and a
 Seurat object was created for each individual dataset. The four datasets were merged into one dataset and ﬁltered on the basis of the number of
 unique molecular identiﬁers (nUMI ≥500), number of genes (nGenes ≥250) and mitochondrial abundance (<20%) for further analysis. Following
 ﬁltering, the datasets were split and to account for batch effects, sequencing depth and to remove technical variability, normalization and variance
 stabilization was performed using the SCTransform (SCT) function in Seurat66. Cell cycle scoring and mitochondrial abundance was calculated and
 regressed out along with the normalization process using SCTransform.
 Integration is based identiﬁcation of common features in different datasets that serves as anchors across these datasets, such that batch effects
 are attenuated65. Merged analysis uses the processed data, but does correct those based on common anchors, and therefore does not correct for
 batch effects. However, as integration may be prone to overcorrection if differences in cellular composition between samples are large67, as may be
 these case in the organoids described here at different time points, we present both integrated (Fig. 7) and merged (Fig. 8) analyses. Features to
 use when integrating the datasets were chosen using SelectIntegrationFeatures function. Principal component analysis for each dataset was done
 individually before identifying integration anchors. We then set the normalization method to ‘SCT’ and the reduction to robust principal component
 analysis while using the FindIntegrationAnchors function. The datasets were integrated using the integration anchors identiﬁed using IntegrateData
 function. Principal component analysis was used to identify the number of dimensions (nDims) for dimensionality reduction of the integrated
 dataset and visualization was performed using RunPCA. nDims was used to compute the shared nearest neighbor graphs using the k-nearest
 neighbor algorithm, to ﬁnd relevant clusters and UMAP for visualization of the clusters was performed using RunUMAP function. Clusters were
 created with resolutions ranging from 0.4 to 0.8. We visualized and analyzed the different clusters on the basis of marker identiﬁcation using
 FeaturePlot and found 0.4 resolution to produce the most biologically informative clusters for our study. We performed pseudotime analysis using

 Plating irradiated MEFs for hPSC culture
 Precoat six-well ﬂat bottom tissue culture-treated plates with 2 ml 0.1% gelatin made with cell culture
 grade water for 15 min at room temperature (20–25 oC). Thaw a frozen vial of pre-irradiated MEFs
 containing ~2 × 106 cells in a water bath at 37 °C. Add the thawed MEFs to 10 ml wash medium and
 centrifuge at 400g for 4 min. Aspirate the wash medium and add 1 ml of MEF medium. Count the
 MEFs and seed at a density of 17,000–25,000 cells/cm2 in 2 ml of MEF media in a normoxic incubator
 overnight. The irradiated MEFs should be plated 1 d before plating of hPSCs to allow attachment and
 spreading of the MEFs producing sufﬁcient extracellular matrix to prevent premature differentiation.

 hPSC culture
 Maintain hPSCs on irradiated MEFs. Culture cells in hPSC maintenance medium. Change medium
 daily. Passage hPSCs with Accutase/EDTA and replate at a dilution of 1:48. Maintain cultures in a
 humidiﬁed normoxic incubator. Further details covering how to properly maintain an hPSC culture
 can be found in ‘ES Cell International Pte Ltd: Methodology Manual Human Embryonic Stem Cell
 Culture 2005’ and ‘Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI) StemBook Protocols for pluripotent cells, URL:
 http://www.stembook.org/protocols/pluripotent-cells’ and in our previously published protocols57,61.
 Lines are karyotyped and veriﬁed for mycoplasma contamination using PCR every 6 months.

 Thawing and aliquoting Matrigel
 Thaw growth factor-reduced Matrigel on ice at 4 °C overnight. For aliquots used for organoid embedding,
 prechill Posi-Click 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tubes on ice for 15 min and aliquot 0.5 ml of thawed Matrigel
 to each tube on ice. For aliquots used for coating of culture plates, prechill 15 ml conical tubes on ice for
 15 min and aliquot 1 ml of thawed Matrigel to each tube on ice. Aliquots can be stored at −20 °C for up
 to 6 months. CRITICAL Keep all parts contacting Matrigel cold to avoid polymerization.
 c


 Coating dishes with Matrigel for MEF depletion
 Thaw 1 ml Matrigel and add to 29 ml of cold IMDM to a 50 ml prechilled conical tube to obtain a ﬁnal
 concentration of 3.3% (vol/vol) and keep on ice. Make sure the diluted Matrigel is mixed well. Imme-
 diately transfer the 10 ml diluted Matrigel/IMDM solution to the 10 cm2 tissue culture dish. Matrigel-
 coated dishes can be used after 3 h of incubation at room temperature or stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.
 Keep the dishes ﬂat in the refrigerator and avoid drying out of the Matrigel coating solution.

 Fibronectin plates
 Prepare ﬁbronectin-coated six-well plates by diluting ﬁbronectin to 4 μg/ml in DPBS. Add 2 ml ﬁbro-
 nectin/DPBS solution to each well and incubate the plates in a normoxic incubator for at least 30 min or
 4 °C overnight. Make sure the ﬁbronectin coating covers the entire plate (~12 ml of a six-well plate).

 66 Low endoderm yield Some hPSC lines do not generated Try multiple lines and use lines that generally yield DE of
 endoderm efﬁciently >90% purity as determined by CXCR4/cKIT/EPCAM
 staining. Alternatively, CXCR4 microbeads can be used
 to enrich the endodermal population on d4. DE cells do
 not survive well after sorting
 Vigorous pipetting during We noticed that pipetting during dissociation of EBs for
 dissociation ﬂow cytometric analysis can lead for loss of CXCR4
 expression
 Suboptimal reagents Critical reagents for DE induction are MEFs used for
 maintenance of hPSCs, N2/B27 and Activin A. These
 need to be batch-tested for DE induction using a line
 that reliably generates DE
 Inadequate hPSC maintenance DE is the most problematic germ layer to generate.
 Verify pluripotency of hPSCs by staining for OCT4 and
 SOX2 (~100% of the cells should be positive). Even if
 the cells express proper pluripotency markers, the
 optimal density matters. We typically plate RUES2 cells
 at a density of 7,000–9,000 cells/cm2 and hiPSCs at
 10,000-15,000 cells/cm2. If excessive cell death is
 observed, 10 μM Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor) to hPSC
 maintenance media for the ﬁrst 24 h following plating
 can be tried. MEFs for hPSC maintenance are plated at a
 density of 17,000–23,000 cells/cm2. However, optimal
 density can vary from batch to batch and needs to be
 tested using DE induction as the end point

 smaller and fewer organoids will be observed on d8.
 These small organoids tend to become hollow spheres
 faster in culture. If the culture is initiated with many
 more than 7.5 × 105 cells per well, organoid formation
 might be less obvious on d8. In this case, the organoids
 can still be resuspended and proceed to Ventralization
 and LBO formation (Fig. 9a, right). These densities may
 have to be adjusted for different hPSCs lines
 Small LBOs at d10 (Step 99) Organoids might be small on d10. If they do not sink to
 the bottom, add 1 ml of fresh media directly to the well
 and wait for two more days before replacing the media
 Exhaustion of the culture media LBOs are highly proliferative between d8 and d20
 (Fig. 9b and Supplementary Fig. 1). If the media turn
 yellow quickly, more fresh ventralization media/
 branching media can be fed to each well

 branching organoids in Matrigel generation
 Timing of LBO plating in Matrigel The optimal timing to embed organoid is between d20
 and d25. When culturing organoids in suspension for
 too long, they will become hollow spheroids and
 eventually burst and reform smaller cell clumps
 (Fig. 9c). These small cell clumps will not generate
 branching organoids
 Picking of LBOs Although no clear correlation could be found between LBO
 morphology and subsequent quality of Matrigel organoid
 generation, it is best to avoid picking very dense LBOs that
 lack the folding structures, or LBOs with cysts
 Rapid polymerization of Matrigel We suggest embedding organoids one insert at a time
 to avoid Matrigel solidiﬁcation in U-bottom 96-well
 plate before transferring to 24-well inserts
 (Steps 107–112)
 Exhaustion of the culture media With multiple organoids in one insert, more
 ventralization media/branching media can be fed to
 each insert, especially in later-stage organoid cultures


Anticipated results
 Brightﬁeld images of the sequential stages of differentiation are shown in Fig. 1b. Using this dif-
 ferentiation protocol, self-organizing cell clumps will form in 2 d after switching to the ventralization
 medium/branching medium (Fig. 1b, iv). Some of the organoids will detach from the monolayer but
 most of them will remain loosely attached to the plate. The number of organoids formed in each well
 varies from hundreds to thousands. The cell clumps might look damaged right after suspension, but
 they will self-organize/repair themselves the next day. Cell clumps appear homogeneous at the
 beginning and folding structures (Fig. 1b, v) will appear 2–3 d after suspension. Folding structures
 will become more complex with time (Fig. 1b, vi). Budding of organoids happens within 1 week after
 embedding in Matrigel and obvious branching can be observed after 2–3 weeks (Fig. 1b, vii). For-
 mation of self-organizing cell clumps might not be obvious in some iPS lines. However, they will form
 self-organizing cell clumps after suspension and branch out after embedding in Matrigel. These
 organoids can be maintained for more than 6 months and will ﬁll the entire well they are cultured in.
 Organoids can be analyzed using standard approaches, including RT–qPCR (Box 1), IF (Box 1),
 ﬂow cytometry and RNAseq as published20, as well as scRNAseq (Boxes 2 and 3). We use mRNA

 expression predominantly to compare organoids of different genotypes or grown in different con-
 ditions to each other. We prefer to benchmark development by morphology and IF, as published20,28
 rather than mRNA expression by RT–qPCR or bulk RNAseq. mRNA determination typically uses a
 baseline control and reports fold changes compared with this control. In the developmental trajectory
 of the organoids, these would be LBOs or hPSCs. However, the latter do not express mature dif-
 ferentiation markers, leading to large and highly variable fold changes. For example, Fig. 3a shows the
 mRNA fold changes of ABCA3 and surfactant genes when comparing more mature organoids (d170)
 with immature organoids (d15 and d25)20. Since immature organoids do not express or express very
 little mature markers, the fold changes of these markers are high and very variable due to the
 inﬁnitesimally small denominator.
 Examples of IF studies and anticipated results at consecutive stages, using d20 and d60 as
 representative examples, are shown in Fig. 5. During the AFE stage, cells grow in islands containing
 mostly SOX2+ cells, although clusters of cells expressing the hindgut markers CDX2+ are present
 within these islands (Fig. 5a, d8, left). The islands of epithelial cells are interspersed with ZEB1+
 mesenchymal cells (Fig. 5a, d8, right). In the suspension stage at d20, LBOs consist of folding and
 invaginating epithelial cells surrounded by mesenchymal cells (ZEB1+), while large sections of most

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 LBOs express NKX2.1 (Fig. 5b, d20). After development in Matrigel, NKX2.1 and EPCAM are
 expressed in the entire periphery of the organoids from ~d40 on (Fig. 5c), indicating nearly full
 commitment to the lung lineage. We also discovered at this stage (images shown are d60) small
 hollow tubular structures in the dense centers of the organoids that expressed EPCAM but not
 NKX2.1 (Fig. 5c). These cells express FOXA1 indicating that they are endodermal (Fig. 5d). Most
 proliferating cells, as detected by staining for Ki67 are in the periphery (Fig. 5d, inset 1), although rare
 proliferating cells were also observed in the central endodermal tubules (Fig. 5d, inset 2, arrow).
 Surrounding these structures in the center are cells, identiﬁed by the presence of 4′,6-diamidino-
 2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Fig. 5e), that did not stain with any lung or airway markers, or with
 mesenchymal markers (CD90, ZEB1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB) (not shown). However, staining for
 cleaved CASPASE3 (cCASP3) reveals that, whereas apoptotic cells are rare to absent in the tips
 (Fig. 5e, inset 1), the cells in the center outside the tubules were largely apoptotic (Fig. 5e, inset 2).
 These may be remnants of the mesenchymal cells present in the LBOs.
 As scRNAseq is now a standard analysis method, we provide scRNAseq data of 25-, 40-, 60- and
 80-d-old organoids that conﬁrm the IF data, and also provide a more granular view of differentiation.
 This analysis revealed ten clusters (Fig. 7a), with, as expected, a progressive gain of distal lung markers
 and disappearance of mesenchymal and other endodermal markers (Fig. 7b). While many clusters
 could not be assigned to speciﬁc cell types and probably represent transitional states, as is to be
 expected in differentiating, fetal-stage organoids, some clusters could be identiﬁed (Fig. 7c). Cluster 8
 consisted of only proliferating cells. However, we note that Ki67+ cells were also present throughout,
 and their frequency decreased over time. All clusters except cluster 9 expressed FOXA1 (Fig. 7c) and
 EPCAM (not shown), and are therefore endodermal, consistent with our published IF studies. Cluster
 9 are mesenchymal cells whose abundance and proliferation (as evaluated by Ki67 expression) declines
 over time, again consistent with our previously published studies using ﬂow cytometry20. These
 expressed, in addition to classical mesenchymal markers such as THY1, ACTA2, ZEB1 and COL1A2,
 also TBX4 and WNT2B. TBX4 is expressed in pulmonary mesenchyme53, whereas WNT2B is
 expressed in the endoderm surrounding ventral AFE and essential for induction of a pulmonary fate in
 this area52. The mesenchyme is therefore consistent with pulmonary or anterior foregut mesenchyme.
 We identiﬁed mesenchyme expressing these markers previously in RNAseq studies of LBOs20. The
 lung marker NKX2.1 (also known as TTF1) and the lung progenitor marker, CPM24, are ﬁrst only
 observed in clusters 0 and 1, and then progressively spread to the other clusters such that at d80 the
 organoids are entirely NKX2.1+CPM+. The widespread expression of NKX2.1 conﬁrms our IF studies
 (Fig. 5c and ref. 20). Furthermore, at d60 and d80, progressive induction of the distal, predominantly
 AT2-associated markers (NAPSA, SFTPB, SFTA3, LPCAT1, ABCA3) is observed (Fig. 7c). Low levels
 of expression of these markers are already evident in cluster 1 at d40 as well (Fig. 7c). However, no
 SFTPC was detected, consistent with the fact that full AT2 maturation occurs late in the development
 of the organoids and is highly variable20, indicative of slowly progressive development. This is con-
 sistent with the reanalysis of our published RNAseq data in Fig. 3a, where even at d170 expression of
 SFTPC was not present in all organoids, and was lower than that of the other surfactant proteins and
 of ABCA3 (ref. 20). We note that cells in cluster 1 also expressed the club cell marker, SCGB3A2, at d25,
 with expression becoming more diffuse later on. We previously identiﬁed small populations of
 SCGB3A2 in the organoids by IF20. It is possible that the SCGB3A2+ cells are precursors of the recently
 identiﬁed SCGB3A2+ cells in the most distal airways that may function as transitional intermediates
 between AT1 and AT2 cells6–8. Basal cells, deﬁned by expression of p63 and NGFR and mucin-
 producing cells were not detected (not shown). When a merged (as opposed to integrated)62 analysis of
 the data was performed, each timepoint formed a separate major cluster, at least in part due to batch
 effects. Nevertheless, the decrease in endodermal markers and the increase in distal markers with time
 was evident (Fig. 8). scVelo trajectory analysis63 at each timepoint indicated trajectories that ended in
 the population expressing distal lung markers (NAPSA, SFTPB, SFTA3, LPCAT1, ABCA3) (Fig. 8b).
 Taken together, the data show progressive acquisition of a distal lung at the expense of alternative
 endodermal fates and attrition of mesoderm throughout the development of the organoids.
 In alveolospheres, stomach and intestinal markers were identiﬁed by scRNAseq56. Furthermore,
 from our own previous analysis of RNAseq data, a variable and modest match with human intestine
 was observed20. These data suggest that other endodermal cells may be present during directed
 differentiation into lung. We therefore veriﬁed the scRNAseq data from the organoids for such
 markers. Indeed, the small clusters 4 and 5 expressed mid- and hindgut markers, such as CDX2 and
 GATA4 (ref. 64), the expression of which progressively wanes at later stages. However, intestinal and
 stomach markers could not be detected by IF. To verify whether the NKX2.1−FOXA1+ cells in the

 centers of the organoids might expressed other endodermal RNAs but not protein, we punched out
 the centers of the organoids with a 1,000 μl pipette tip and compared the expression of select
 endodermal genes in centers and tips by RT–qPCR (Fig. 6). The centers of the organoids were indeed
 consistently enriched for mRNAs encoding endodermal markers such as CDX2 (midgut and hindgut)
 and PDX1 (pancreas), whereas some other markers, such as MUC13 and GATA4 (stomach) were
 more variably enriched. Small populations of cells with other endodermal potentials may therefore be
 present in the centers of the organoids, at least initially.
