8. Dissociate cells with Accutase and prepare a single-cell suspension of hiPS cells the same way as described above (day 0, Steps 2–4). Resuspend the cells with 3% BSA/DPBS (wt/vol) supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632. Filter the cells with a 50-μm cell strainer and collect the cells in 15-ml conical tubes.
9. Conduct FACS to collect mCherry+ cells, which are cells that are infected by the lentivirus (the lentivirus encoding the sgRNA library also encodes mCherry to label infected cells). Uninfected control cells should be processed similarly as negative controls to set the gate. Seed the sorted mCherry+ cells at low density in 10-cm dishes coated with vitronectin in 10 ml of pre-warmed E8 medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632. Place the plate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.
