58. Change the medium every 4–5 d. Aspirate approximately half of the old medium and replace it with 10 mL of fresh organoid propagation medium (the total volume of medium is ~15 mL). Place dish(es) back on shaker in the incubator. It is expected that during the next 4 months organoids will exhibit notable cell migration and process extension into the MG (Fig. 5b,c). They will also substantially increase in size, reaching 3–5 mm in diameter by 5 months post‑induction (Fig. 5d–g).
59. After 3 months in MG on the shaker, switch to the organoid maturation medium (with trophic factors). Continue changing the media every 4–5 d.
60. Switch back to the organoid propagation medium (without trophic factors) after 1 month (at 4 months in MG on the shaker).
