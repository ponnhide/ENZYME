44. Change the medium every other day for 2 weeks by removing 50% of the old medium (150 µL) and adding 150 µL fresh amplification medium with 2× concentrations of FGF2 and EGF to achieve final FGF2 and EGF concentrations of 10 ng/mL.
45. Take images of SNR‑derived organoids at 1, 7 and 14 d post‑isolation to document organoid development (Figs. 3 and 4). Only 1‑month‑old organoids that show a consistent increase in size and maintain a single lumen (Fig. 3) are embedded in MG or used for dissociation (Step 61A) and scRNA‑seq or immunohistochemistry (Step 61C).
