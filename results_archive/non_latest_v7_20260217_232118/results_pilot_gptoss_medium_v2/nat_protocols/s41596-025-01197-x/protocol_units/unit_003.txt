22. One day before the initiation of neural induction, replate PS cells at a 1:1 ratio into new MG‑coated wells following the procedures described in the preceding section (Steps 13–20).
23. On the next day (day 0) (Fig. 2b), cell should be 90% confluent again. Initiate neural induction by aspirating half of the stem cell medium and adding 2 mL of neural induction medium.
24. Change medium daily. During medium changes, tilt the plate ~30° and aspirate ~90% of the old medium with floating cells. Then, add 4 mL of fresh neural induction medium. Repeat this daily for 7–10 d. Stop neural induction and transition to the next step when the typical signs of successful neural induction are observed, including tissue thickening, curling and detachment (Fig. 2c).
