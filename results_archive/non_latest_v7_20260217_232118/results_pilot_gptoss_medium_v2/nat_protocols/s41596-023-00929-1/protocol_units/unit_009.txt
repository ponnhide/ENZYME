56. Obtain a 24-well plate.
57. Calculate the amount of collagen coating solution needed. We recommend 500 µL of
 collagen coating solution (0.03 mg/mL) per well.
58. Add 500 µL of collagen coating solution (0.03 mg/mL) into each well.
59. Incubate plate with collagen for 30 min at 37 °C.
60. After incubation, remove collagen coating solution from all wells.
61. Wash wells once with 1× PBS and then they are ready to use (if not using immediately,
 keep PBS in the wells and store in 37 °C incubator until the sorted cells are ready to
 be plated).
