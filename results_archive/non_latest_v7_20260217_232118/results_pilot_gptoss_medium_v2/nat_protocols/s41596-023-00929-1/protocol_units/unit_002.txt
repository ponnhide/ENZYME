7. Distribute tissue into three 15 mL conical tubes.
 • Aliquot the tissue–buffer solution in the dish into the tubes first
 • Use extra HBSS/BSA/glucose buffer to wash the dish and make up to
 5 mL per tube
8. Add 167 µL of collagenase/dispase (100 mg/mL) to each tube. Please note,
 167 µL of collagenase/dispase per 5 mL is equivalent to 33.4 µL of solution
 per 1 mL.
9. Digest for 30 min in rotating oven at 37 °C.
 ▲ Critical step Optimal enzymatic digestion is the most important factor
 to maximize yield. Therefore, this step may need optimizing to achieve
 sufficient but not too much digestion. See also the troubleshooting advice
 for Step 54.
