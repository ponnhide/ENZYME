62. Spin down sorted mural and/or endothelial cell tubes (from Step 54) by centrifuging for
 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.
63. After spinning, remove supernatant from microcentrifuge tubes containing cells.
64. Add 500 µL of prewarmed (37 °C) growth medium into microcentrifuge tubes containing
 mural or endothelial cell pellets.
65. Resuspend.
66. Add the desired amount of cell solution into collagen-coated wells. We recommend filling
 each culture well with cell solution to approximately half volume.
67. Add additional 500 µL of growth medium into wells containing cells for 1 mL total
 per well.
68. Add 500 µL of 1× PBS to all other empty wells to keep them from drying.
69. Place in a 37 °C incubator.
