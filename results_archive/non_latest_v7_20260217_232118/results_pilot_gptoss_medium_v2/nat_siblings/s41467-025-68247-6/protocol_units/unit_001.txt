For organoid generation, colon tissue was first sliced open lengthwise and wiped 3–4 times with gauze (Fisher Scientific) to remove waste and mucus. The tissue was then cut into small sections of ~2” × 2” and placed into a 15 cm dish filled with PBS++ (PBS supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X Pen-Strep (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 2.5 μg/mL Amphotericin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific)).
