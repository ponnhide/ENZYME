We evaluated the two multiplexing paradigms through a deep reconstruction of neurodevelopmental trajectories, provided proof of principle of their suitability for linking genetic variation to neurodevelopmental trajectory phenotypes and modeled the scalability of the system, analyzing different multiplexing combinations with an increasing number of lines
