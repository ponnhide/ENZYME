 Human pluripotent stem cells and tissue-resident fetal and adult stem
 cells can generate epithelial tissues of endodermal origin in vitro that
 recapitulate aspects of developing and adult human physiology. Here, we
 integrate single-cell transcriptomes from 218 samples covering organoids
 and other models of diverse endoderm-derived tissues to establish an initial
 version of a human endoderm-derived organoid cell atlas. The integration
 includes nearly one million cells across diverse conditions, data sources
 and protocols. We compare cell types and states between organoid models
 and harmonize cell annotations through mapping to primary tissue
 counterparts. Focusing on the intestine and lung, we provide examples of
 mapping data from new protocols and show how the atlas can be used as
 a diverse cohort to assess perturbations and disease models. The human
 endoderm-derived organoid cell atlas makes diverse datasets centrally
 available and will be valuable to assess fidelity, characterize perturbed and
 diseased states, and streamline protocol development.

Life sciences study design
All studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.
 Sample size We collected all the representative scRNA-seq data sets of different human endoderm-derived organoids protocols that are accessible

 Data exclusions Quality control was applied to exclude cells with low quality. Detailed methods are described in the Methods section (page 38)

 Replication For the mini colon-organoids, replicates were successfully performed as indicated in this previously published paper (https://www.cell.com/
 cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(24)00184-X). Iindividual replicates demonstrated a high degree of uniformity, highlighting the consistency
 of the experimental procedures and reproducibility of the system. For the atlas we integrated the previously published samples into one
 embedding to study cross-organoid-protocol overlap and reproducibility. For our generated differentiation and perturbation protocols we
 used two separate successful controls for the experiments.

 Randomization This study is mainly an accumulative effort of existing published data for which a classical blinding strategy does not apply in our opinion. For
 integration method validation and the factor effect integration validation, we randomly selected samples. Generally, all compared or
 combined samples were integrated and analyzed with the same computational parameters and strategies. For integration method validation
 and the factor effect integration validation, we randomly selected samples.

 Blinding This study is mainly an accumulative effort of existing published data for which a classical blinding strategy does not apply in our opinion. All
 combined samples were integrated and analyzed with the same computational parameters and strategies to ensure comparability.

Animals and other research organisms
Policy information about studies involving animals; ARRIVE guidelines recommended for reporting animal research, and Sex and Gender in
Research

 Laboratory animals Immunocompromised NOD-SCID IL2Rg null (NSG) mice (strain no. 0005557) were used in organoid transplantation experiments.

 In accordance with the guidelines for facilities, housing, and environmental management set forth by the Guide for the Care & Use of
 Laboratory Animals, the University of Michigan Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine (ULAM) uses an established set of standard
 lighting practices in all animal housing rooms on campus. Housing rooms employ centrally controlled and monitored light cycles that
 utilize a 12-hour light / 12-hour dark photoperiod. Temperatures are maintained within plus or minus 2 degrees throughout a range
 of ~18-26°C with 30-70% humidity.

 Wild animals We do not use wild animals in this study.

 Reporting on sex Mice were solely used for transplantation experiments for human organoids and we therefore did not analyze any potentially male or
 female biased mouse gene expression data of either sex in this study.

 Field-collected samples We do not use field-collected samples in this study.

 Ethics oversight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol # PRO00006609)

Note that full information on the approval of the study protocol must also be provided in the manuscript.


Plants
 Seed stocks Report on the source of all seed stocks or other plant material used. If applicable, state the seed stock centre and catalogue number. If
 plant specimens were collected from the field, describe the collection location, date and sampling procedures.

 Novel plant genotypes Describe the methods by which all novel plant genotypes were produced. This includes those generated by transgenic approaches,
 gene editing, chemical/radiation-based mutagenesis and hybridization. For transgenic lines, describe the transformation method, the
 number of independent lines analyzed and the generation upon which experiments were performed. For gene-edited lines, describe
 the editor used, the endogenous sequence targeted for editing, the targeting guide RNA sequence (if applicable) and how the editor
 was applied.
 Authentication Describe any authentication procedures for each seed stock used or novel genotype generated. Describe any experiments used to
 assess the effect of a mutation and, where applicable, how potential secondary effects (e.g. second site T-DNA insertions, mosiacism,
 off-target gene editing) were examined.
