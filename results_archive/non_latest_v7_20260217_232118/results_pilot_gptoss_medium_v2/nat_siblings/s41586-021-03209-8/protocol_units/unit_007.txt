H3K27ac CUT&Tag libraries were prepared as previously described60, with modifications. In brief, cells were dissociated from human cortical tissue as described above. Fifty thousand cell aliquots were reconstituted in neural induction medium at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 200 μl CUT&Tag wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Nuclei were isolated by resuspending cell pellets in 200 μl dig-wash buffer before resuspension in 100 μl dig-wash buffer supplemented with 2 mM EDTA and a 1:50 dilution of H3K27ac primary antibody (Cell Signaling 8173), and incubated overnight at 4 °C on an overhead rotary orbital shaker rotating at 90 rpm, and changed to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12-based medium containing 1× glutamax, 1× N2, 1× B27 without vitamin A and 1× antibiotic–antimycotic (anti-anti).
