Once the seeded cells reached 70–80% confluency, 1 µg ml−1 donor for the 1205-4 line was a 30-year-old female; the donor for the 2242-1 line was a 4-year-old male; and the donor for the 1208-2 line was a 20-year-old female. of puromycin in StemFlex medium (Life Technologies, catalogue no. A3349401) was supplemented for 5 days. Colonies were visible at the end of 5 days of selection in puromycin.
