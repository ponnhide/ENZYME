Two LGR5-targeting sgRNAs were cloned into SpCas9-equipped HP180 plasmids (a gift from Hui Yang lab), generating LGR5 sgRNA plasmids and HDR template were co-electroporated into human intestinal organoids using a NEPA21 electroporator (Nepa Gene) following published methods45. Organoid colonies derived from single cells were manually picked, expanded, and genotyped. To interfere with MBD3 expression, sgRNA sequences targeting MBD3 were cloned into SpCas9-equipped HP180 plasmids and electroporated into established LGR5-mNeonGreen reporter cells. Colonies from single cells were manually picked, expanded, and screened by Western blotting using an MBD3 antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz).
