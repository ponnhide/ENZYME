After solidification, droplets were overlaid with culture medium containing 10 μM Y-27632 (TargetMol). The medium was changed every 3 days.",

Organoid colonies derived from single cells were manually picked, expanded, and genotyped. To interfere with MBD3 expression, sgRNA sequences targeting MBD3 were cloned into SpCas9-equipped HP180 plasmids and electroporated into established LGR5-mNeonGreen reporter cells. Colonies from single cells were manually picked, expanded, and screened by Western blotting using an MBD3 antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz).",
