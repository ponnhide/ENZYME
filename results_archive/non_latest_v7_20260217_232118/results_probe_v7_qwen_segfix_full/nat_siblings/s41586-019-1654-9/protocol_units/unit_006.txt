Organoid sections were quickly washed in PBS to remove any residual OCT. Then, sections were incubated in antigen retrieval solution (HistoVT One, Nacalai Tesque) at 70 °C for 20 min, followed by incubation with DAPI (1:3000), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (goat, 1:1,000, Thermo Fisher, A11008), Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (goat, 1:500, Thermo Fisher, A-21123), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-rat antibody (goat, 1:500, Thermo Fisher, A-21247) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (goat, 1:1,000, Thermo Fisher, A11008).
