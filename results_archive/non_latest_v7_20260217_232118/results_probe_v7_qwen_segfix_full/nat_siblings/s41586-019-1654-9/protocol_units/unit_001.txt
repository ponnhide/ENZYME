TrypLExpress (Thermo Fisher) incubation for 5 min, followed by addition of mTeSR1. Cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 200g and resuspended in mTeSR1, filtered through a 20-μm strainer and washed with mTeSR1. Cells were then centrifuged again for 5 min at 200g and resuspended in mTeSR1, counted, diluted to the same concentration and mixed at equal ratios for the three cell lines to be loaded on the 10x microfluidic chip aiming for 10,000 cells.
