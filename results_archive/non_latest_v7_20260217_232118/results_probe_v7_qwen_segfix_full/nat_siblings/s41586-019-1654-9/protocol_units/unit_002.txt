Organoid pieces were incubated in Papain at 37 °C (enzyme mix 1) for an initial 15 min, followed by addition of Enzyme A (enzyme mix 2) to the Papain mix. Organoid pieces were then triturated using wide-bore 1,000-ml tips and incubated for additional intervals of 5–10 min with enzyme mix 1 (approximately 30 min.).
