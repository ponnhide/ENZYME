Organoids were then resuspended in primary antibody diluted in organoid wash buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% BSA (Miltenyi)) overnight at 4 °C on a rocker. On the following day, organoids were washed three times (2 h per wash at 4 °C on a rocker) in organoid wash buffer, and then resuspended in secondary antibody with DAPI diluted in organoid wash buffer. On the next day, organoids were washed three times with PBS (2 h per wash at 4 °C on a rocker), and then placed in a 96-well glass bottom plate.
