Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks were sectioned at 5 µm thickness using a microtome and processed according to Nanostring’s protocol. Deparafﬁnization and antigen retrieval were performed using the Leica Bond RX system. Slides were incubated with ER1 (AR9961, Leica) at 100 °C for 20 min to retrieve antigens. Subsequently, proteinase K was added through the pipetting port. The plate was placed in the tissue culture incubator for at least 30 min.
