Organoids were resuspended in 100 µL cell staining buffer (2% BSA, 0.01% Tween in PBS) and then blocked with 5uL human TruStain FCX blocking buffer (BioLegend) for 10 min on ice. Organoids were then washed three times with cell staining buffer on ice. After the ﬁnal wash, organoids were resuspended in 0.04% BSA in PBS, ﬁltered through a 70 µm Flowmi cell strainer (Sigma Aldrich) and loaded onto a 10X Chromium X.
