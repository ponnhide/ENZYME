Organoids were then imaged on a Nikon spinning disc confocal to collect ﬂuorescence and DIC images, and the percentage of intact organoids was calculated as the number of organoids per condition/donor that excluded FITC-dextran from the lumen divided by the total number of organoids. For apoptosis quantiﬁcation, organoids were imaged on a Nikon spinning disc confocal to collect ﬂuorescence and DIC images. The % area of caspase was quantiﬁed using FIJI66 as the area of organoid stained positive for Caspase-3/7 divided by the total area of the organoid.
