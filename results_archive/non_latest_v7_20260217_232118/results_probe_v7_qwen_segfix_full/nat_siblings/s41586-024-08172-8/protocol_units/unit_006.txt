We computed the wkNN graph using the compute_wknn method of the mapper instance with k = 100.
The cell ranger-processed scRNA-seq data for the primary atlas27 were obtained from the link provided on its GitHub page (https://storage.googleapis.com/linnarsson-lab-human/human_dev_GRCh38-3.0.0.h5ad). For further quality control, cells with fewer than 300 detected genes were removed and subsequently natural-log transformed.
