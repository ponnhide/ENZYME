We instantiated a mapping object from the HNOCA-tools package (at commit fe38c52) using the saved scPoli45 model weights from the HNOCA integration. Using the map_query method of the mapper instance, we projected the community datasets to HNOCA. We used the following training hyperparameters: retrain = 'partial', batch_size = 256, unlabeled_prototype_training = False, n_epochs = 10, pretraining_epochs = 9, early_stopping_kwargs = early_stopping_kwargs, eta = 10, alpha_epoch_anneal = 10.
