wkNN-based primary developing brain atlas label transfer to HNOCA cells
Given the wkNN estimated between primary reference27 and query
neurons, as well as the NTT labels for non-telencephalic neurons, constraints were added to the transfer procedure. For regional labels, only the non-telencephalic regions, namely diencephalon, hypothalamus, thalamus, midbrain, midbrain dorsal, midbrain ventral, hindbrain, cerebellum, pons and medulla, were considered valid categories to be transferred. The label-transfer procedure was only applied to the non-telencephalic NPCs and neurons in HNOCA.
