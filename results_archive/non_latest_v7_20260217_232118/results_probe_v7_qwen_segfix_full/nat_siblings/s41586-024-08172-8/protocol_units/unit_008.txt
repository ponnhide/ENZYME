To compare expression levels of two groups of paired cells, the expression difference per gene of each cell pair is first calculated on the basis of the log-normalized expression values. Next, for each gene to test for DE, its variance over the calculated expression difference per cell pair (σ2) is compared with the sum of squared of expression differences (di for gene i) normalized by the number of cell pairs: s02 = ∑i =1 di / n. Here, an F-test is applied for the comparison, with f = σ2/s20, d.f.1 = n − 1 and d.f.2 = n.
