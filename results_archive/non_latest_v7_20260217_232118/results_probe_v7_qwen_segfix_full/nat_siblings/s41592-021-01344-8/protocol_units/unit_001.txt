Time points of scarring induction were selected around critical steps of organoid development including EB formation (day 4), neural induction (day 7), neuroepithelium development (day 15) and neurogenesis (days 20 and 30). We used cluster similarity spectrum (CSS) analysis31 to integrate 44,275 cells from 12 organoids across two batches
