We combined lineage information with pseudotemporal ordering to compare the distribution of cells over pseudotime in different lineages (Fig. 6f,g). Importantly, the iTracer-perturb system enables inducible or temporally controlled perturbation, tracing, and measurement of states in any mosaic organoid system.
