M cells. TNF-α (50 ng/mL) treated for the ﬁrst 4 hours and RANKL (100 ng/mL) for total 3 days.
Tissues were washed with DPBS to remove debris. The tissues were treated with 2.5 mM EDTA at 4 °C for 40 minutes to release crypts. The supernatant containing crypts was collected and embedded in Cultrex RGF BME (R&D Systems) droplets in 48-well plates (~50 crypts/well). After solidiﬁcation, droplets were overlaid with culture medium containing 10 μM Y-27632 (TargetMol).
