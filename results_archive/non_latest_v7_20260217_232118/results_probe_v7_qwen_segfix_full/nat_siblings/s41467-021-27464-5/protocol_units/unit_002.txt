At day 10, the resulting 3D structures were mechanically detached from the bottom of the plate with a spatula and transferred to a 6-well plate (Corning, #3471) and grown in suspension (free floating). Silk-VM organoids were embedded in 30 µL droplets of Matrigel and cultured following the VM organoid-differentiation protocol described in the subsection “hPSC VM organoid differentiation”.
