Calcium imaging was performed at day 120 of VM cultures containing the MAP2‐GCamP5 reporter. Imaging was performed on an inverted Ti2 microscope (Nikon) equipped with a CSU‐W1 spinning-disc system (Yokogawa), a sCMOS camera (Teledyne Photometrics), and a 20 × objective. An environment control chamber was used to maintain the temperature at 37 °C and CO2 level at 5% during imaging. Exposure time was set to 50 ms. Spontaneous activity was recorded from 3 different silk-VM organoids.
