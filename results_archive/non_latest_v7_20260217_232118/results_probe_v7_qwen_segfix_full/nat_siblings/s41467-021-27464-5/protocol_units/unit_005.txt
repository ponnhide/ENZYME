For diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining, the sections were incubated with secondary biotinylated horse antibodies diluted (1:200, Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature (RT), washed three times, and then incubated with avidin-biotin complex (ABC) for 1 h at RT for amplification. Peroxidase-driven precipitation of DAB was used to detect the primary antibody. In this step, the sections were incubated in 0.05% DAB for 1–2 min before addition of 0.01% H2O2 for a further 1–2 min. After development of DAB staining, the sections were placed in an ammoniacal silver solution to detect neuromelanin using a Masson Fontana Stain Kit (Atom Scientific, #RRSK12-100), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
