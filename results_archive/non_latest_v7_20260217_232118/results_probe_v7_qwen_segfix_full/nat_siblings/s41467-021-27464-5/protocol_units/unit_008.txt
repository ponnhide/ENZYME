Quantification of fluorescence for developmental layers identified was performed using Image J software (NIH, v1.49). Measurements were performed by taking a radial line-intensity profile (80 µm width) for each channel from the center of the organoid to the edge of the organoid, subtracting the background and recording the position where the positive signal begins and ends. Recordings were normalized to the length of the radial line and mean value with standard deviation plotted for each of three fluorescence channels.
