Three-electrode setup with a pyrolyzed carbon fiber as the working electrode was used to detect dopamine. Electrode fabrication, electrochemical characterization, and setup assembly were performed as previously described49. In short, to perform the measurements, an organoid was placed on the working electrode immersed in baseline buffer, a constant potential was applied, and the resulting current monitored. Dopamine release was chemically triggered through addition of stimulation buffer that elevated K+ concentration to 150 mM.
