Both conventional and silk-VM organoids were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 20% DMSO and then in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween20, 0.1% C24H39NaO4, 0.1% NP40, and 20% DMSO overnight at 37 °C. After incubation with primary antibodies for 2 days at 37 °C, the organoids were incubated for 2 days with the appropriate secondary antibody, embedded in 1% agarose, and dehydrated in an ascending series of methanol concentrations and dichloromethane as previously described62.
