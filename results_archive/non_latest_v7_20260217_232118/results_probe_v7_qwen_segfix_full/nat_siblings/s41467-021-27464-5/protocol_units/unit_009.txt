For quantifications, each section was quartered into 4 equal areas and then scanned using a confocal microscope under 20X magnification. The number of TH+, Calb+, Girk2+, and DDC+ cells was manually counted in each area using Image J software (NIH, v1.49), and summed to give the total number of positive cells per slice. Counting was performed on 8 every 3 sections and the final counts were corrected for the total number of sections per organoid.
