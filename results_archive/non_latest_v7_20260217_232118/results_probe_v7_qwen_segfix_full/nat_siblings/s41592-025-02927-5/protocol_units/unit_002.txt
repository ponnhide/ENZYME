showing morphogen treatment modalities in this study, representative marker genes (POU5F1, stem cells; TFAP2A, non-neural ectoderm and hindbrain; SOX2, neural stem cells; STMN2, neurons; FOXG1, telencephalon; NKX2-1, ventral telencephalon; VSX2, retina; HOXB2, hindbrain; FOXA2, f... showing different the treatment took place (up is early, down is late). Concentration experiments are represented by progressively taller bars. The shading of the dots and bars in timing and concentration experiments represents the concentration used (darker shading means higher concentration). 'X' indicates untreated (control) organoids.
