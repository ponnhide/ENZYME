We harvested organoids at an early time point (day 21) to capture neuroepithelial populations through patterned progenitors.
Four MiSTR tissues from similar culture conditions (slight variations in SHH and PM concentrations) were stained and showed similar compartmentalization of NKX2-1 expression.
