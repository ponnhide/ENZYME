Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis overlapping with frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD) is a fatal and currently untreatable disease characterized by rapid cognitive decline and paralysis. Elucidating initial cellular pathologies is central to therapeutic
target development, but obtaining samples from presymptomatic patients is not feasible. Here, we report the development of
a cerebral organoid slice model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that recapitulates mature cortical
architecture and displays early molecular pathology of C9ORF72 ALS/FTD. Using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing
and biological assays, we reveal distinct transcriptional, proteostasis and DNA repair disturbances in astroglia and neurons.
We show that astroglia display increased levels of the autophagy signaling protein P62 and that deep layer neurons accumulate
dipeptide repeat protein poly(GA), DNA damage and undergo nuclear pyknosis that could be pharmacologically rescued by
GSK2606414. Thus, patient-specific iPSC-derived cortical organoid slice cultures are a reproducible translational platform to
investigate preclinical ALS/FTD mechanisms as well as novel therapeutic approaches.

Policy information about availability of data
 All manuscripts must include a data availability statement. This statement should provide the following information, where applicable:
 - Accession codes, unique identifiers, or web links for publicly available datasets
 - A list of figures that have associated raw data
 - A description of any restrictions on data availability

1. scRNA-seq data that support the findings have been deposited in the GEO database (accession code: GSE180122).
2. The figures with associated raw data (GEO and Supplementary Data Files 1-5) include Figures 1-3, Extended Data Figures 1-3, Supplementary Figure 3.

Field-specific reporting
Please select the one below that is the best fit for your research. If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before making your selection.
 Life sciences Behavioural & social sciences Ecological, evolutionary & environmental sciences
For a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdf


Life sciences study design
All studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.
 Sample size Statistical test details and sample sizes have been summarised in Supplementary Table 3. No sample size calculation was performed. The
 sample sizes using hiPSC lines and organoids were estimated from previously performed experiments (e.g. Giandomenico et al., Nature
 Neuroscience (2019); Tyzack et al., Nature communications (2017). Sample sizes and origins are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 and 3.

 Data exclusions No acquired data was excluded from the statistical analyses. (A few damaged sections/slices were not used for data collection).

 Replication Experiments were repeated three times (or two times for GSK treatments), which included at least 3 independent biological replicates
 (organoids/cells grown from separate independent batches and/or cell lines), leading to similar results. At least three biological replicates
 were used for all statistical analyses in biological experiments.

 Randomization The in vitro experiments were not fully randomized. Sample allocations into groups included independent organoids, ALI-COs or immersed CO
 slices grown from different cell lines and/or as separate batches (independent biological replicates). Batches of organoids were randomly
 selected from each cell line-group. ALI-COs or immersed CO slices deriving from identical whole organoids were only used in separate studies
 or as adequate control-treatment slice-pairs for each independent biological replicate. No randomization was used for cell culture
 experiments using non-differentiated cultures of hiPSCs.

 Blinding For analysis the subjects were blinded for the observers. This involved masking original sample identification and assigning coded IDs before
 data collection.


Reporting for specific materials, systems and methods
We require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies. Here, indicate whether each material,
