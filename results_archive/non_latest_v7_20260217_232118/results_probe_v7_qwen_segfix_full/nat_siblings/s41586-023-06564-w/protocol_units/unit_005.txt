The boundary of the assembloid in individual frames was manually delineated using the nuclear stain signal (roughly every 40 frames); these boundaries were used to create an Imaris ‘surface’ to define the hCO (Supplementary Video 1). The 3D hCO was then reduced into a two-dimensional (2D) projection using the maximum intensity function in Fiji. To measure the Dlxi1/2b::eGFP intensity in a consistent manner for all samples, the hCO-hSO boundary was aligned vertically.
