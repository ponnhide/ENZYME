Using a sterile, pulled and bevelled glass micropipette, ganglionic eminences were locally coinjected with a CAG-driven GFP plasmid (pCAG-IRES-GFP, gift from C. Cepko through Addgene, plasmid no. 11159, ref. 59) mixed with either a sgRNA–Cas9 complex (Synthego) directed to mouse Lnpk or Cas9 protein alone. Randomly picked slices were electroporated with horizontally oriented pad-paddle electrodes at 50 V using a BTX Square Pulse electroporator
