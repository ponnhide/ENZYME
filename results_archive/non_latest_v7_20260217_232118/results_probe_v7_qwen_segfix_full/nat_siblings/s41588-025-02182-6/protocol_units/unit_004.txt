PCA was performed on the normalized data, and the top 30 principal components were chosen for calculating the k nearest neighbors (kNN). Using the kNN, a UMAP was generated to visualize the data in a lower-dimensional space. To cluster the data, the Leiden clustering method with a resolution of 2 was applied.
The most specific cell type was annotated for each cluster based on these criteria.
