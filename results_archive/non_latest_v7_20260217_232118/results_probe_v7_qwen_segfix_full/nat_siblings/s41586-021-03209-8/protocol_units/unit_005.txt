After tagmentation, nuclei were lysed with the addition of 100 μl DNA binding buffer (Zymo Research), and tagmented DNA was purified with a 1.5:1 ratio of AMPure XP beads (Beckman) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified DNA was eluted in 21 μl buffer EB (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) and mixed with 2 μl each 10 μM indexed i5 and i7 primers and 25 μl NEBNext HiFi 2 × PCR Master mix. Libraries were amplified with the cycling conditions: 72 °C for 5 min; 98 °C for 30 s; 12 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s and 63 °C for 30 s;
