Somatic mutations were analyzed by the HMF somatic mutation workflow from https://github.com/hartwigmedical/pipeline which was installed the pipeline locally using GNU Guix with the recipe from https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/guix-additions. Brieﬂy, sequence reads were mapped against human reference genome GRCh37 using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (BWA-MEM) v0.7.5a. Subsequently, somatic single-base substitutions (SBSs) and small insertions and deletions (INDELS) were determined by providing the genotype and tumor (or organoid for in vitro analysis) sequencing data to Strelka v1.0.14 with adjustments as described in58.
