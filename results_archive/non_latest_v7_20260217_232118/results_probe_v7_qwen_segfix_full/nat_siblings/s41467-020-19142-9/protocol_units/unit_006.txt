Tumor biopsies were digested into single cells using collagenase II (1 mg/ml, Gibco, Thermo Fischer Scientific), supplemented with hyaluronidase (10 µg/ml) and LY27632 (10 µM) for 30 min at 37 °C while shaking. Dissociated tumor cells were plated in BME and organoids were cultured in HISCM minus Wnt conditioned medium and supplemented with 10 µM LY27632 at 37 °C.
