Organoids were dissociated and DNA was isolated using the QiaSymphony DSP DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen; 937236). Libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq DNA Nano Library Prep Kit (20015964). Paired-end sequencing of the organoid lines was performed (2 × 150 bp) on the generated libraries with 30× coverage using the Illumina HiSeq X Ten sequencing system at the Hartwig Medical Foundation.
