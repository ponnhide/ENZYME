Per fraction, three technical replicates were measured by LC-MS/MS.
Crypts of the healthy portion of the colonic epithelium (at least 10 cm away from the tumor side) were isolated by digestion of the intestinal mucosa in chelation solution (5.6 mM Na2HPO4, 8.0 mM KH2PO4, supplemented with dithiotreitol (0.5 mM, Sigma) and EDTA (2 mM, in-house) for 30 min at 4 °C. Colonic crypts were subsequently plated in basement membrane extract (BME; Cultrex PC BME RGF type 2, Amsbio).
