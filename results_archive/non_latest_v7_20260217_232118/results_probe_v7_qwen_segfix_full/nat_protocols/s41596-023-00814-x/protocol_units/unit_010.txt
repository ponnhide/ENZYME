Transfer 60-d-old organoids each to one well of a suspension culture 12-well plate. Add 2 ml of OVB-organoid medium per well. Keep the plate in absolute darkness at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h before ERG experiments. Set up the ERG aperture and fill the superfusion system with an oxygenated OVB medium. Place organoids under red light in an electrode chamber. For dose-dependent light sensitivity, expose each organoid to 500 ms long flashes. Start with a low intensity of 2,000 mlux, increase to 20,000 mlux and then to 200,000 mlux. Repeat each intensity three times at 3 min intervals.
