Prepare Tissue-Tek Cryomold containing Tissue-Tek OCT Compound solution. Transfer the dehydrated organoids with a cut 200 µl micropipette tip or an inoculation loop, from the sucrose solution tube into the OCT mold. Place one organoid in the center of the mold and orient it to either cut median or horizontal sections.
