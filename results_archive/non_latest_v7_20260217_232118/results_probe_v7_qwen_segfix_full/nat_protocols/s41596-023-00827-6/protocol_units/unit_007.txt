Add 1 ml of cell recovery reagent to the insert such that the embedded organoid with Matrigel falls into the 15 ml centrifuge tube. Close the 15 ml centrifuge tube and immediately place on ice to depolymerize the Matrigel. Every 20 min, gently shake the tube to check if the Matrigel has dissolved and place it back on ice. Once the Matrigel has dissolved, add 10 ml of wash medium to the tube. Time varies from ~45 min to 1 h depending on Matrigel thickness. Centrifuge at 200g for 5 min. Aspirate the wash medium and cell recovery reagent and add 1 ml of Accutase to the organoid and incubate at 37 °C. Gently shake the tube to disturb/dissociate the organoid every 5 min and replace the tube at 37 °C for 10–12 min. When the organoid is dissociated add 10 ml wash medium and centrifuge at 400g for 4 min. Aspirate the wash medium and resuspend the pellet in base medium.
