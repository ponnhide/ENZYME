Next, LBOs are generated (Steps 93–99). This is accomplished by resuspending clumps of cells at d8 and maintaining those in ultra-low-attachment plates in the presence of CHIR, FGF10, FGF7, BMP4 and RA, where they will form spheres consisting of folding epithelial sheets interspersed with mesenchymal cells (Fig. 1b, v, vi and Fig. 3b).
