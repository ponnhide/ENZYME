Fill another 10 cm Petri dish with 15 mL organoid propagation medium (without FGF2 and EGF) and place it in the incubator. This dish will be used for MG droplet solidification in the incubator (Step 54). Transfer individual organoids to individual Parafilm dimples using a P200 pipette tip (first cut the tip to enlarge the tip opening to fit the organoid) (Fig. 5a). Remove excess media from the dimples using a P200 pipette. Perform this step under the stereoscope to avoid aspiration of the organoids. Retrieve P200 pipette tips from the −20 °C freezer and use the cold tips to draw up 30 μL thawed MG. Then, carefully add MG on top of the organoid in the Parafilm dimple. Use the same tip to reposition the organoid into the center of the MG droplet and remove bubbles if accidentally introduced.
