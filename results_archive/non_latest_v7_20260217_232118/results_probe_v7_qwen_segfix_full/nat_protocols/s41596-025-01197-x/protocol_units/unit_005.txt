To promote further tissue growth, we adopted the approach developed by Lancaster and Knoblich27 and embedded SNR-derived organoids into Matrigel (MG) droplets (Fig. 5a). Following MG embedding, we observed notable transformations, including substantial tissue growth, migration of cells into MG and extensive radiation of fibers (Fig. 5b,c).
