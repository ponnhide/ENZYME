We manually isolate SNRs that are ~200–300 μm in diameter for organoid generation (Fig. 2f). Cells in SNRs are characterized by the expression of the proliferation markers pH3 and KI67, neural progenitor markers SOX2 and NESTIN, and telencephalic markers PAX6 and FOXG143, suggesting telencephalic identity.
