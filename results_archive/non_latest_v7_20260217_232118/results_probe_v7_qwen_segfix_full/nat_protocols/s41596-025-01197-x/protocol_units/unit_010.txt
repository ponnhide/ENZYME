Cut 350-µm-thick slices using the vibratome set to 100 Hz frequency, 1.2 mm amplitude and a slow (3–6 mm/min) forward movement velocity (Fig. 9b). Stop the vibratome after each slice. Under a magnifying glass, use a bent insulin needle to separate the slice from the remaining tissue, and transfer the slice into a maintenance beaker with bubbling ACSF using a wide Pasteur pipette.
