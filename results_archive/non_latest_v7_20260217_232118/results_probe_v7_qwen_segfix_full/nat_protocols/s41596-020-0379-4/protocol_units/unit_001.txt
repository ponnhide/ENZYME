If so, remove non-epithelial components as much as possible using surgical scissors or scalpels and forceps under a dissection microscope. If not, continue to the next step immediately.
CRITICAL STEP Non-epithelial material may slow down the digestion to single cells or cause an overestimation of the number of (epithelial) cells with organoid-forming capacity.
