Dispensing of organoids for screening (Steps 51–57)
On the day the screen is started (the timing depends on which organoids are used to perform the screening), dispase can be added to the culture to remove the BME or Matrigel. Organoids should be subsequently washed and filtered to remove large organoids, as large organoids will introduce variation in the readout of the screen. After filtering, organoids are counted and the organoid suspension is brought to the desired density in organoid culture media containing 5% (vol/vol) BME or Matrigel.
