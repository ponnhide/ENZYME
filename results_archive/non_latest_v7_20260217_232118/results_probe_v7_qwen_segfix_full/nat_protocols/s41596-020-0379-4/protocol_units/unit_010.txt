l-viability readout and its analysis, is described in Steps 43–81 and overviewed in Fig. 3a.
...are measured using CellTiter-Glo 3D Reagent. After addition of the cell-viability reagent using the Multidrop dispenser, the culture plate with the organoids is incubated to allow lysis of the cells. Readout is performed by measuring the luminescence signal from each individual well. For analysis, the signal obtained from the wells with the negative controls (i.e., drug solvent) is set to 100%, whereas the...
