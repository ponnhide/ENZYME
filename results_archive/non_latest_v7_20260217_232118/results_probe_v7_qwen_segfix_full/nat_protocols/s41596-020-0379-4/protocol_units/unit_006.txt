13 Prepare the required amount of organoid medium (tissue-specific growth factors are listed in Supplementary Table 1), add 10 µM ROCK inhibitor and Primocin (100 µg/ml) and place medium in the 37 °C water bath. For head and neck organoids, additionally add 0.5 µg/ml caspofungin to the human head and neck organoid medium (see Reagent setup).
14 Once the BME drops are solidified (30–60 min), flip the plate and carefully add 500 µl of organoid medium to each well.
CRITICAL Do not add medium directly on top of the BME drops, as this might disrupt the droplets.
15 Place the culture plate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2.
16 Change the medium every 2–3 d by carefully aspirating medium from the wells and replacing it with fresh, pre-warmed medium. Keep ROCK inhibitor and Primocin (in the case of head and neck organoids, also caspofungin) in the culture medium for the first two passages of the culture.
