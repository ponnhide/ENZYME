10 Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in BME or Matrigel. BME should be kept on ice to prevent it from solidifying; thus, work quickly. The amount of BME depends on the size of the pellet. Approximately 10,000 cells should be plated in 40 µl of BME.
CRITICAL Do not dilute BME too much (BME should be >70% (vol/vol)) to ensure formation of solid droplets.
11 Plate the BME containing organoids on the bottom of pre-heated 24-well suspension cell culture plates in drops of ~10 µl each. Place three to four drops into each well.
CRITICAL Once the organoids are resuspended in BME, proceed with plating as quickly as possible, as the BME may solidify in the tube or pipette tip.
CRITICAL Plates should be pre-heated overnight by placing them into a humidified incubator at 37 °C. If not properly pre-heated, BME droplets will immediately flatten out on the surface of the culture plate and organoids can more easily attach to the bottom of the plate.
