6 Digest the tissue (from Step 3) as appropriate based on the tumor type (Table 1). Carefully monitor digestion, and for <2-h incubations, mix contents every 10–15 min by shaking vigorously and by pipetting the mixture up and down using a P1000 pipette. For overnight incubations, place the mixture on a shaker. Addition of 10 µM ROCK inhibitor during digestion can increase outgrowth efficiency. As a rule of thumb, digestion is complete when a mixture of cell clusters (consisting of 2–10 cells) can be observed.
