17 Pipette up and down to disrupt BME or Matrigel, and transfer the organoid suspension to a 15-ml conical tube.
18 To aid in the removal of BME, top the volume up with 10 ml of ice-cold adDMEM/F12+++ medium.
19 Centrifuge organoids at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C.
20 Aspirate the supernatant, and split organoids using either TrypLE (for head and neck and compact breast, colon, pancreatic and liver organoids) or mechanical disruption (ovarian and cystic breast, colon, pancreatic and liver organoids). For TrypLE-based cell dissociation, resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of TrypLE, pipette up and down and incubate at 37 °C until organoids fall apart. Pipette up and down with a P1000 filter tip with a (non-filtered) P10 tip on top for ≥10 times every 3–5 min to aid disruption of the organoids. Monitor digestion closely to keep the incubation time in TrypLE to a minimum. In case of mechanical disruption, resuspend the pellet in 3 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium. Use a P1000 filter pipette tip with a (non-filtered) P10 tip on top to pipette the organoid suspension up and down 30 times. Use the bottom of the tube to create pressure, which will aid organoid disruption.
CRITICAL Do not dissociate in TrypLE for >15 min, as this may result in poor organoid outgrowth or even loss of the culture. As a rule of thumb, digestion is complete if a mixture of small clumps of cells (consisting of 2–10 cells) can be observed.
CRITICAL In case of preparation for drug screening, incomplete digestion resulting in big clumps of cells or pieces of organoid that are left intact will result in a small yield at the collection of organoids, as these will be filtered out during the preparation of the organoid suspension for drug screening.
