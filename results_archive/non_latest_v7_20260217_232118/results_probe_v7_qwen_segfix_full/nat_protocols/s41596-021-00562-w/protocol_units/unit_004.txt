41 Sterilize biosafety cabinet using PREempt disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol.
42 Prepare a coating solution containing 50 µg/ml collagen I in PBS−/−. For 12-well Transwells, add 300 µl of coating solution on the apical side and 1,200 µl on the basolateral side.
43 Incubate the Transwells at 37 °C for at least 2 h to allow collagen coating to occur.
44 Prepare colon monolayer seeding medium as described in Table 4. At least 2 ml should be made for each Transwell plus an additional 1–2 ml for cell counting. Alternatively, medium can be prepared during CRS incubation (Step 46).
45 Collect organoids as described in Steps 20–23.
46 After resuspending in CRS, incubate on ice for 45–60 min, or until Matrigel is dissolved. Resuspend the Matrigel via gentle inversion every 10–15 min, and proceed to the next step 15 min before the end of incubation.
CRITICAL Do not exceed 60 min incubation time in CRS as this can decrease cell viability. The trypsin/EDTA used in following steps will degrade most of the Matrigel matrix.
47 Add 1 ml of prewarmed trypsin/EDTA to the organoid suspension. Incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.
48 Centrifuge at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, there should be a noticeable organoid pellet, ~50–200 µl in size depending on the density of the original culture.
49 During centrifugation, place prewarmed trypsin/EDTA and washing medium inside the biosafety cabinet. Make aliquots of 15 mL of washing medium. One 15 mL aliquot is needed per plate of organoid culture.
50 After centrifugation, place the 15 ml conical tube containing the organoids inside the biosafety cabinet, and aspirate the CRS using vacuum and a sterile Pasteur pipette.
CRITICAL While aspirating the CRS, slowly tip the 15 mL tube and avoid placing the Pasteur pipette too close to the organoid pellet.
51 Resuspend the organoid pellet in 1 ml prewarmed trypsin/EDTA via short and quick repeat pipetting. Incubate the organoid pellet in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min.
CRITICAL Avoid completely drawing up the organoid suspension/pellet when adding trypsin/EDTA. Organoids are very 'sticky'.
