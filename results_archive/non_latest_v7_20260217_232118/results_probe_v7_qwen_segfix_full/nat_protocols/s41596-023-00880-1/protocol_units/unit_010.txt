Referring to Table 3, calculate the total volume of CDBLY2 required for the experiment and for each of the five medium changes (daily from D8 to D12 of differentiation), allowing 1 mL per well of a 12-well plate and an additional 0.5–1 mL medium for pipetting errors. Collect and thaw all required reagents detailed in Table 3 on ice. Working on ice in a biological safety cabinet, make up the total volume of CDBLY2 medium required for the entire experiment in a 50 mL Falcon tube, adding the exact volume of each reagent to cold media. Invert the tube to mix, then aliquot into five individual conical tubes for each medium change and refrigerate. Before each medium change, warm the tube to room temperature.
