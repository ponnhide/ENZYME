Depending on initial seeding densities, you should expect a full 96-well plate of\norganoids from 2 to 3 wells of a 12-well plate.\n(iv) Transfer single organoids (using a cut P1000 tip) to a 6-well low-attachment plate and add\n5 mL of StemPro-34 SFM complete medium including 15% FBS, 100 ng/mL VEGF-A and\n100 ng/mL FGF-2 and incubate the organoids.\n(v) One day after separating the blood vessel networks (d11), use a cut P1000 tip to transfer\nsingle organoids to low-attachment round-bottom 96-well ultra-low-attachment plates.\nAdd fresh StemPro-34 SFM complete medium including 15% FBS, 100 ng/mL VEGF-A\nand 100 ng/mL FGF-2.
