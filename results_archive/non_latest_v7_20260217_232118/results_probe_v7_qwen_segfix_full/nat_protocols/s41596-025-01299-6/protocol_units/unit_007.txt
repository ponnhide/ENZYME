Assembling ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes
67. The sgRNA mix comes in a 96-well plate. Warm the plate to room temperature.
68. Vortex the plate at low speed for 30 s and then centrifuge the plate for 5 min at 500g.
69. Mix 300 pmol of sgRNA with 40 pmol of Cas9 protein in a V-shaped 96-well plate to form an RNP complex for sgRNAs targeting each gene. The stock of our sgRNAs was 100 pmol μl−1 and the Cas9 was 20 pmol μl−1. Therefore, the total volume of our mix was 5 μl.
70. Incubate the RNPs at room temperature for 10 min and then place them on ice until use.

Preparing the cell suspension
71. Aspirate the medium from hiPS cells cultured in six-well plates and wash the cells twice with DPBS.
72. Add 1 ml of pre-warmed Accutase to each well. Incubate at 37 °C for 7 min in a 5% CO2 incubator.
73. Add 1 ml of pre-warmed E8 medium per well to the cells and collect the suspensions into 15-ml conical tubes. Gently pipette the cell suspension a few times with a serological pipette to ensure that any remining clumps are fully dissociated. Centrifuge the samples at 200g for 5 min.
74. Aspirate the supernatant and then resuspend the cells in E8 medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632. Count the cells manually by using a Bright-Line hemacytometer.
75. We use 0.5 million hiPS cells per nucleofection reaction. To generate 15 KO cell pools for 15 target genes, plus one negative control, a total of 8 million cells is required. An additional 1 million cells are included to account for potential loss during the process. Therefore, transfer 9 million cells to a new 15-ml Falcon tube and centrifuge at 200g for 5 min.
76. Aspirate the supernatant completely and resuspend the cells with 360 μl of nucleofection solution.

Preparing cell/RNP solution
77. Transfer 20 μl of the hiPS cell suspension into each well of the 96-well plate containing 5 μl of RNP complex. Mix two to three times through pipetting.

Nucleofection
78. Transfer each cell-RNP mixture (25 μl) to each well of the Nucleocuvette strips. Click the lid tight.
79. Gently tap the strip on the benchtop to make sure that the sample covers the bottom of the cuvette and that there are no bubbles in the wells.
80. Place the Nucleocuvette strips with closed lid into the retainer of the 4D-Nucleofector X unit. Check for proper orientation of the Nucleocuvette strips.
81. Start the nucleofection process by using the CA137 program.
▲ CRITICAL STEP Nucleofection efficiency and cell survival rate differ greatly when using different nucleofection programs. We tested multiple nucleofection programs and found that the current program resulted in high nucleofection efficiency and minimal cell death. Optimize nucleofection programs on the basis of specific cell types.
82. After run completion, carefully remove the Nucleocuvette strips from the retainer. Add 70 μl of pre-warmed E8 supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 to resuspend the cells. Mix the cells by gently pipetting up and down two to three times.

Plating cells
83. Add 5 μl of the cell suspension to one well and the rest to another well of a six-well plate.
▲ CRITICAL STEP Seed the desired number of cells according to your experiment. We seed 5 μl of the cell suspension into a single well of a six-well plate, achieving confluency after 4 d of culture, allowing for passaging or hiPS cell aggregation. Any extra cells can be seeded in another well and frozen for future use.
84. Change to E8 medium without Y-27632 the next day.
