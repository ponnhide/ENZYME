Day 1: hiPS cell transduction
● TIMING 9 h
6. Aspirate the medium from each well and replace it with 1 ml of pre-warmed E8 medium supplemented with 5 μg ml−1 polybrene and the empirically determined volume of lentivirus encoding the sgRNA library. After 8 h, add another 1 ml of E8 medium to each well. Place the plate back in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Maintain one plate of uninfected hiPS cells as a negative control.
▲ CRITICAL STEP Before conducting the screen, optimize the volume of lentivirus required to achieve the desired transduction efficiency—typically ~20–50%—to ensure that transduced cells ideally carry only a single copy of the sgRNA expression cassette.
