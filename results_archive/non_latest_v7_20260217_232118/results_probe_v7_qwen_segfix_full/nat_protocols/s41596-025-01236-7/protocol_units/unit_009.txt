Once the individual component stocks are properly prepared as outlined above, thaw the aliquots of component stocks and use them to prepare 100 ml of complete hNPSR-v2 medium by referring to Table 4. All stock aliquots can be used for the preparation of 100 ml of complete hNPSR-v2 medium, except for 10 mM A83-01 stock (first stock), which needs to be further diluted by mixing 1µl of 10 mM A83-01 with 199 μl of DMEM/F12 medium to make a 50 μM A83-01 stock solution (second stock). The thawed stock medium components have different shelf-lives. For growth factors, it is best to store them at 4 °C and use them within 2 weeks. For small molecules, including the second stock of A83-01, they are good for ≤1 month at 4 °C. The complete hNPSR-v2 medium can be stored at 4 °C for 2 weeks.
