For that, after dissociating the cells (Step 39), count the cell density and seed 100,000 cells into one 1.7-ml Eppendorf tube and then centrifuge at 300g for 5 min. Resuspend the pellet with 100 µl of hNPSR-v2 medium and seed into one well of a Matrigel-coated 96-well plate. On the next day, these cells will attach to the plate and are ready for immunofluorescence staining directly in the 96-well plate. Aspirate the culture medium and add 50 µl of 4% PFA (wt/vol) aqueous solution to fix the cells for 10 min at room temperature. Aspirate the 4% PFA fixative from the well and wash the well with 100 µl of PBS three times. Aspirate the PBS after the last wash and add 100 µl of blocking buffer for 20 min. Aspirate the blocking buffer, add 60 µl of blocking buffer containing the desired primary antibodies and incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Aspirate the primary antibody solution and add 100 µl of PBST to wash the well three times. Aspirate the PBST after the last wash, add 60 µl of blocking buffer containing the desired secondary antibodies and incubate for 30 mins at room temperature. Aspirate the secondary antibody solution and then wash the well with 100 µl of PBST three times.
