The expandable iNPCs can be used for nephron organoid formation. Once the iNPCs have reached a confluency of 80–90%, they are dissociated into single cells and reaggregated at 30,000 cells per aggregate to form iNPC aggregates overnight in 96-well U-bottom low-attachment plates. iNPC aggregates are then gently transferred to a six-well Transwell plate for air–liquid interface culture. The aggregates are treated with 6 µM CHIR99021 for 1 h (phase I medium), which mimics the natural epithelization signal in vivo. For the first 5 d, the aggregates are cultured in phase II medium containing FGF9. Starting from day 5, culture medium is switched to phase III medium, which supports the maturation of nephron cell types until day 21.
