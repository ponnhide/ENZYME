      "text": "The hPSCs are routinely maintained in feeder-free conditions in commercially available mTeSR Plus medium (STEMCELL Technologies). Routine testing for mycoplasma is performed, and hPSCs are discarded if they test positive. Extracellular matrix Matrigel and various Matrigel alternatives have been used to coat the plates for the expansion of hPSCs. In this manuscript, although we still use the term ‘Matrigel’ to indicate the extracellular matrix, we actually use a Matrigel alternative, Cultrex (R&D Systems), in our laboratory rather than the traditional Matrigel (BD Biosciences). No differences between the two extracellular matrixes are observed in supporting hPSC expansion. The hPSCs are passaged by using a gentle dissociation method using Versene solution (or 0.5 mM EDTA solution) to get small clumps for replating. If hPSCs are thawed for experimental use, it is highly recommended to let them recover for two to three passages before proceeding for differentiation. We recommend using hPSC lines with no more than 75 passages.",
