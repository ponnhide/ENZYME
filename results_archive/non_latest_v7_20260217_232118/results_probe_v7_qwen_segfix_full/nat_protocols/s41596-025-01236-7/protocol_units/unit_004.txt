Once the hPSC-derived iNPCs have been purified via FACS, they are immediately cultured in hNPSR-v2 medium. Within 2–3 d, these iNPCs form clusters in culture as observed for the culture of primary human NPCs. hNPSR-v2 medium is refreshed every 1–2 d. Once the iNPCs reach a confluency of 80–90%, they are dissociated into single cells with Accumax and passaged at a 1:10 split ratio on Matrigel (Cultrex)-coated plates.
