Resuspend the pellet in an appropriate amount of BME. As a guideline, 200 µl is sufficient for a pellet of ~50 µl. The amount of BME to add scales linearly with the pellet volume. Plate 100 µl of BME containing organoid fragments per well of a 12-well plate. Turn the plate upside down and leave in the biosafety cabinet for 5 min. Transfer the plate, upside down, into a 37 °C incubator and leave to solidify for 30 min. Add 750 µl of pre-warmed (RT to 37 °C) Type 1 or Type 2 medium to each well and transfer to an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.
