If you want to generate clonal organoid cultures after transfection, we recommend using an organoid culture that allows passaging via single cells. Using single cells, as opposed to fragments, will increase the likelihood that the organoids growing out after selection (e.g., by puromycin) indeed originate from single cells and are, thus, clonal.
