For example, Nutlin-3a can select for cells over-expressing MDM2, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) can select for cells over-expressing KRAS. We recommend defining the optimal concentration per selection agent and organoid culture, which is often the lowest concentration that kills 100% of untreated organoids."
