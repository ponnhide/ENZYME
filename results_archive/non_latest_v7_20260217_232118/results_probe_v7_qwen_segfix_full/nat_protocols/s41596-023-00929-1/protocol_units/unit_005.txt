Control (cell) tube preparation
● Timing ~5 min
▲ Critical A total of six controls are needed (see Step 43). We recommend only using cells for
the unstained and DAPI controls because they cannot be performed with beads. This strategy
does not waste cells on fluorescence controls and optimizes yield. However, if the user prefers
not to use beads, cells can be used for all controls. In that case, a small part of the sample should
be removed for control staining.
36. Obtain the three leftover 15 mL tubes after combining sample contents into one tube (Step 19).
37. Sequentially, rinse each tube with ~500 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose and combine into one tube.
38. Obtain six fresh FACS tubes and fresh 70 µm filters.
39. With the filters on top of the FACS tubes, dispense 250 µL of combined buffer rinse into two
 of the FACS tubes.
40. Proceed to Step 41.

Control (beads) tube preparation and immunostaining
● Timing ~5 min
41. Dispense 250 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose into each of the four remaining FACS tubes.
 ▲ Critical step If using cells rather than beads as controls, add at least 10,000 cells per
tube in HBSS/BSA/glucose.
42. Add 2.5 µL of a single antibody to each single-color control tube into the FACS tubes
 containing 250 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.
43. For the live/dead stain, add 1.25 µL of DAPI into the FACS tubes containing 250 µL
 of combined buffer/cell rinse. One tube will be unstained.

 2 CD45 PE–Cy7 1:100 250 µL 2.5 μL
 3 CD146 PE 1:100 250 µL 2.5 μL
 4 ANPEP APC 1:100 250 µL 2.5 μL
 5 CD31 FITC 1:100 250 µL 2.5 μL
 6 Unstained NA 250 µL NA

Protocol extension

44. After adding antibodies as explained in Step 43, shake the UltraComp eBead
 vial and add one drop of beads to each single-color control with the ‘Ready to Use’
 bottle. Please note, beads are designed to bind antibodies and eliminate the need
 to use cells for many controls. Therefore, do not add beads to DAPI and unstained
 controls. If cells are being used for all controls, then do not add beads to any of
 the controls.
45. Seal the tubes and place on ice.
