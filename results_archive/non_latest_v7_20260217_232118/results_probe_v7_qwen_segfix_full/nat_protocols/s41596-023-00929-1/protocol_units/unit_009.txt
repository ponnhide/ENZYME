Cell culture
Changing media
● Timing ~10 min
70. Determine the amount of EGM-2 medium required for passaging based on plates and/or
wells required. Aliquot endothelial cell growth medium in a 50 mL conical tube.
71. Obtain plates with cells from 37 °C incubator.
72. Place new tip on vacuum. Aspirate the old growth medium from the plates.
73. Using a serological pipette, add 1× PBS to each plate. For a 24-well plate, we recommend
0.5 mL per well. Swirl each plate, then vacuum off the majority of PBS.
 ◆ Troubleshooting
74. Using another serological pipette, add fresh growth medium to each plate. For a 24-well
plate, we recommend 0.5 mL per well. Swirl each plate once.
75. Place plates back into the 37 °C incubator.
76. Repeat Steps 70–75 to change media approximately every other day. Monitor confluency
and when confuency has reached 75–80%, proceed to passaging (Step 77).
