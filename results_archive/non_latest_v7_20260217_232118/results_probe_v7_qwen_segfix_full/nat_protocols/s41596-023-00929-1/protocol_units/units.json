However, if the user prefers\nnot to use beads, cells can be used for all controls. In that case, a small part of the sample should\nbe removed for control staining.\n36.

      "text": "FACS\n● Timing ~2 h\n▲ Critical Every flow cytometry system will have slightly different procedures. Here are\nhigh-yield principles to execute a successful flow cytometry experiment.\n46. Set the laser levels for each of your fluorophores with unstained and single-color controls.\n47. Once the laser levels are set, then run the single-color controls again to record each\n fluorophore. After every single-color control has been run, the machine can perform\n compensation, the method of correcting for fluorescence spill over.\n48. Once the laser levels are set and compensation performed, the user can draw gates to select\n sequential populations (Fig. 3a). For this strategy, we recommend first eliminating debris\n with side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) gates. These are size and complexity\n parameters.\n49. Next, eliminate doublets also with SSC or FSC.\n50. Eliminate dead cells. We use DAPI but a number of live/dead stains exist in different\n fluorophores.\n51. After eliminating debris, doublets and dead cells, then the user should set up\n FACS plots to select their population of interests. In our studies, endothelial\n cells were isolated as CD45−CD31+ANPEP− and mural cells were isolated as\n CD45−CD31−ANPEP+.\n52. (Optional) Run additional controls to determine the true population. These may include\n ‘fluorescence minus one’ controls and unstained controls.\n53. After the population has been defined, use a 100 µm nozzle to perform cell sorting.\n ▲ Critical step A smaller filter may damage the cells.\n54.
