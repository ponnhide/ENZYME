Passaging and FACS
● Timing ~30 min plus FACS
▲ Critical Ideal cell confluency for high-yield FACS and cell health is 75–80% plate coverage.
77. Aliquot endothelial cell growth medium in a 50 mL conical tube.
78. Obtain plates with cells from 37 °C incubator.
79. Place new tip on vacuum. Vacuum out the old growth medium from the plates.

80. Using a serological pipette, add 1× PBS to each plate. For a 24-well plate, we recommend
0.5 mL per well. Swirl each plate, then vacuum out the PBS.
