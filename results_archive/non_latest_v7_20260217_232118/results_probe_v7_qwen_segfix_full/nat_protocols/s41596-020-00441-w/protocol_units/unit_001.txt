Pre-coat 24-well plates with GFR Matrigel as described in Reagent setup. The coated plates can be wrapped in Paraﬁlm and kept for ≤2 weeks at 4 oC.
CRITICAL STEP All tissue culture steps in this protocol should take place in a sterile environment and be performed with aseptic technique to prevent culture contamination.
Take a six-well plate of undifferentiated PSCs and remove the mTeSR1 by aspiration from the wells to be passaged (Fig. 2a).
Wash the wells with 2 ml of sterile DPBS. Aspirate the DPBS.
Add 1 ml of accutase to the wells.
Incubate at 37 oC for 5 min, allowing PSC colonies to dissociate into single cells.
Add 5 ml of warm DMEM/F12 to each well to sufﬁciently dilute the accutase.
Gently triturate each treated well two to three times before transferring the 6 ml of PSCs in medium to a conical tube. Repeat the process with the remaining wells until all cells are collected into the same conical tube.
Centrifuge the cells at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C.
Aspirate the medium from the conical tube.
Add warm mTeSR1 to the conical tube.
Count the cells.
Aspirate the Matrigel from the prepared Matrigel-coated 24-well plate (from Step 1).
Plate the cells at a density of 100,000–150,000 cells/well in 500 μl of mTeSR1 including 10 μM Y-27632 on a Matrigel-coated tissue culture 24-well plate. Prepare cells with at least two independent wells to generate anterior and posterior gut spheroids at the same time.
Place the 24-well plate in a tissue culture incubator and ensure that the single cells are evenly distributed in the wells by gently moving the 24-well plate side to side.
Incubate overnight in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
