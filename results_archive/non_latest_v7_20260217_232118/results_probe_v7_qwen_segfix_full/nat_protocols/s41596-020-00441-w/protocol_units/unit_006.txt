For longer-term culture, HBPOs can be transferred to six-well Transwells for air–liquid interface culture at day 13.
Aspirate the medium from the well. Using a mechanical pipette with a wide-bore 200-µl tip, pick up the entire Matrigel drop with embedded HBPO. The Matrigel-embedded HBPO should dissociate easily from the bottom of the well.
(Optional) If using an HBP anlage speciﬁc reporter line (such as a PROX1 reporter) before transferring to Transwells, perform dissection of the boundary region of the HBPO to increase epithelial bifurcation rate. Transfer the HBPO to a spot plate containing DPBS placed on a ﬂuorescent microscope. Using two clean micro knives in either hand, carefully dissect the HBPO by studying the ﬂuorescent activity under the microscope. Using a Pasteur pipette, pick up the dissected HBPO.
Transfer the (dissected or undissected) HBPO to a six-well Transwell. Add one HBPO per Transwell.
Add 10 µl of fresh pre-chilled 100% Matrigel over the organoid to cover it.
Incubate the organoid in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 3 min.
Carefully add 500 µl–1 ml of gut growth medium to the bottom of the Transwell.
CRITICAL For air-liquid interface culture, do not wet the upper side of the Transwell membrane.
Maintain organoid cultures at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air and replace the gut growth medium every 2 d. The HBPO on the Transwell can be cultured for ≤50 d without passaging.
CRITICAL Do not wet the upper side of the Transwell membrane during medium exchange.
