Repeat the process with the remaining wells until all cells are collected into the same conical tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the medium from the conical tube.\nAdd warm mTeSR1 to the conical tube.\nCount the cells.\nAspirate the Matrigel from the prepared Matrigel-coated 24-well plate (from Step 1).\nPlate the cells at a density of 100,000–150,000 cells/well in 500 μl of mTeSR1 including 10 μM Y-27632 on a Matrigel-coated tissue culture 24-well plate. Prepare cells with at least two independent wells to generate anterior and posterior gut spheroids at the same time.\nPlace the 24-well plate in a tissue culture incubator and ensure that the single cells are evenly distributed in the wells by gently moving the 24-well plate side to side.\nIncubate overnight in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.",
