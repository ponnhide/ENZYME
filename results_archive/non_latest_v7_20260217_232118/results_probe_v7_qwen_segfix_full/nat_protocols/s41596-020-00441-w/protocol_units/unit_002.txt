Check the conﬂuency of the cells by using an inverted microscope. Cells should have reached 80–90% conﬂuence (Fig. 2b).
CRITICAL STEP It is imperative that the cell conﬂuence is as close to 80–90% as possible. If the cell density is too high or low, this can result in overgrowth of mesoderm, cell death after activin A treatment and/or incomplete differentiation. Before beginning differentiation, titrate the cell number for each line to ensure 80–90% conﬂuence on day 0. It is possible to wait an additional 24 h until this conﬂuency is reached; aspirate the mTeSR1 and add 500 μl of fresh mTeSR1 to each well.
Warm an aliquot of day 0 medium to room temperature.
CRITICAL Pre-warming the medium on this day helps to increase cell survival.
Aspirate the mTeSR1 medium. Add 0.5 ml/well of day 0 medium to the 24-well plate. Place the plate back in the incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.
View cells under an inverted microscope to determine if cells are still attached to the tissue culture plate (Fig. 2b). If there are few or no cells attached, abandon the protocol and restart.
Aspirate the day 0 medium.
Add 0.5 ml/well of fresh day 1 medium to the 24-well plate.
Place the plate back in the incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.
