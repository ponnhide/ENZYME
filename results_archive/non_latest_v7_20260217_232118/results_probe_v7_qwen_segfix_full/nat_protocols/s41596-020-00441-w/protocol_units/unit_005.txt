On day 9, embed A–P spheroids in Matrigel drops and culture in gut growth medium to generate multi-organ HBPOs (Fig. 3c). Maintain the spheroid cultures at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air and replace the gut growth medium every 4 d.
Pick up a fused A-P spheroid by using a mechanical pipette with a wide-bore 200-µl tip and place the spheroid into a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube.
Spin down and carefully remove the supernatant with a regular sterile ﬁlter pipette tip.
CRITICAL Organoids may be visible but be difﬁcult to see; a dissecting microscope will help with visibility and handling.
Add 20–30 µl/well of 100% Matrigel (Phenol Red–Free) on ice to the fused A-P spheroid in a 1.5-ml tube. Gently re-suspend the single A-P spheroid by using a mechanical pipette with a wide-bore 200-µl tip and slowly plate it on a 24-well tissue culture plate (VWR International) to make a Matrigel drop.
CRITICAL To avoid solidiﬁcation of Matrigel, this step should be performed quickly. The tissue culture plate does not need to be on ice.
Incubate the drop in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 5 min.
Flip the plate upside down and incubate for a further 5 min to prevent the spheroid from attaching to the bottom.
Add enough gut growth medium to cover the entire drop and culture for 4 d to generate HBPOs. Cultures for spheroids should be maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air, and the gut growth medium should be replaced every 4 d.
