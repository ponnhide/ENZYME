On day 8, pick up one generated single posterior spheroid with entire medium in a well by using a mechanical pipette with a wide-bore 200-µl tip. Pipette up and down ﬁrst so that the spheroid gets suspended in the medium.
Transfer the posterior spheroid to a well containing one anterior spheroid in the same 96-well round-bottom ultra-low attachment plate (Fig. 3b).
Centrifuge the plate at 1,000 r.p.m. for 1 min to gather spheroids and incubate at 37 °C for 24 h to form fused boundary spheroids (anterior-posterior gut spheroid; A-P spheroids).
