31 Each day on days 3–6, warm anterior day 3–6 medium and posterior day 3–6 medium at room
temperature and then aspirate the media and replace with 500 μl/well of the prewarmed anterior
day 3–6 medium (for anterior gut cells) and prewarmed posterior day 3–6 medium (for posterior
gut cells). Owing to the high number of live cells in each well, the phenol red in the medium will
turn yellow by 24 h. Conﬁrm the presence of 3D structures forming from the monolayer of cells,
including attached and ﬂoating spheroids (Fig. 2d–f).
