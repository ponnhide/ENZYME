      "text": "Protocol\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nSeveral protocols have been established for the directed differentiation of human pluripotent\nstem cells (hPSCs) to kidney tissue, generating organoids with segmented nephrons surrounded\nby stroma and endothelium1–5. However, in all instances, nephron patterning remains immature.\nThe immaturity of the proximal tubule (PT) is particularly problematic given the unique role of\nthis structure in nephron reabsorption and secretion, and thus overall kidney functionality. This\nimmaturity critically limits the potential usefulness of kidney organoids for applications such as\ndrug development and toxicology research, as well as studies of PT dysfunction and disease. In\nthis Protocol, we describe in detail our recently published methodology for generating kidney\norganoids with enhanced PTs (PT-enhanced kidney organoids)6.\n\nDevelopment of the protocol\nThe PT-enhanced organoid protocol builds on our earlier methods for generating hPSC-derived\nkidney organoids, which have transitioned from hPSC maintenance using mouse embryonic\nfeeder layers to the use of feeder-free hPSC culture conditions, utilizing either APEL or\nTeSR-E6 medium to support subsequent differentiation4,7–10. However, there are several\ndifferences between these original methods and the PT-enhanced organoid protocol with\nrespect to the duration of the metanephric nephron progenitor specification phase and the\nmaintenance of this population before three-dimensional (3D) micromass generation6. While\nour original Takasato protocol generates 3D kidney organoids from an intermediate mesoderm\npopulation at day 7 of monolayer differentiation, prolonged differentiation and suppression of\nprecocious epithelialization in the current protocol favors improved metanephric progenitor\nidentity and proximal patterning of the resulting organoids.\n The PT-enhanced kidney organoid protocol possesses specific adaptions to the stepwise\ndifferentiation phases to primitive streak and intermediate mesoderm that influence the\nresulting metanephric identity of the progenitors. In the initial stages of the PT-enhanced\nprotocol, similar to the Takasato method9,10, hPSCs—embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced\npluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)—cultured in two-dimensional monolayer conditions of carefully\ncontrolled cell density are initially induced with canonical WNT signaling to form primitive\nstreak. To encourage a metanephric identity, posteriorization of the primitive streak is\npromoted by prolonging the duration of canonical WNT induction to 5 d before the addition\nof FGF9, known to encourage robust posterior intermediate mesoderm formation3,4,9 (Fig. 1a).\nThe subsequent monolayer differentiation phase is then extended beyond day 10 (with\nday 13 determined to be optimal6) with the introduction of nephron progenitor supportive\nmedium (CDBLY2; modified from CDBLY11) to better emulate the complex morphogen signaling\nenvironment and timing of metanephric kidney development12–16, as well as the appearance of\nSIX2-expressing progenitors during kidney organoid differentiation7.\n The provision of CDBLY2 at day 8 of monolayer differentiation prolongs FGF9 exposure\nwhile simultaneously maintaining low-level canonical WNT, BMP and NOTCH signaling to\nsupport nephron progenitor self-renewal11,17–20, assisting nephron progenitor commitment,\nnephron patterning and maturation21–23. As a result, CDBLY2 not only supports and expands\nthe progenitors, but also prevents spontaneous epithelialization of the monolayer, prolonging\nthe progenitor specification phase of the differentiation compared with standard organoid\nprotocols6.\n Monolayer cells are aggregated on day 13 of differentiation, when the culture contains\npredominantly committed and primed progenitors, intermediate mesoderm and metanephric\nmesenchyme6, and transferred to a Transwell membrane for air–medium interface culture\nin a 3D format (Fig. 1a,b). Following 14 d of culture in TesR-E6 basal medium, with an initial\n5 d exposure to FGF9, the resulting PT-enhanced organoids possess more mature PTs\ncompared with those derived from a range of standard organoid protocols, with improved\ntransporter expression and evidence of S1/S2/S3 PT segmentation. The higher levels of\nnephron functionality also translate to a more detectable PT damage response following\nnephrotoxic insult and an improved ability to model severe acute respiratory syndrome\n\nNature Protocols | Volume 18 | November 2023 | 3229–3252 3230",

The generation of hPSC-derived kidney organoids is now\na well-established methodology, capable of developing segmented nephrons with evidence\nof proximal, distal, stromal and endothelial elements1,2,8,9,46–48. However, standard kidney\norganoids model the developing kidney, displaying PT immaturity at both a phenotypic\nand functional level6,49,50. In this Protocol, we describe a unique methodology to generate\nintact proximalized nephrons in an organoid format, together with cortical stroma, loop of\nHenle and endothelial populations. Although less mature than fully differentiated adult PTs\nin vivo, PT-enhanced organoids display superior PT maturation compared with standard\norganoids derived from a range of protocols, with evidence of S1/S2/S3 PT cell types, improved\nfunctionality and suitability as a model of PT damage and disease.\n\nApplications and limitations\nPT-enhanced organoids represent a powerful model for a range of applications, such as\nscreening of drugs for nephrotoxic side effects, pharmaceutical efficacy testing, discovery\nof novel treatments for proximal tubular diseases, modeling of inherited or acquired\ndiseases with a proximal tubular dysfunction phenotype, kidney developmental studies,\nand bioengineering approaches to disease treatment. However, PT-enhanced organoids face\nsome limitations that are similarly shared with existing standard organoids. Overall immaturity\nand inability to culture kidney organoids long term to achieve structural and functional\nmaturation are currently key limitations of the model. Despite displaying improved maturity,\nsome important transporters show low expression levels in PT-enhanced organoids, such as\nSLC22A2/OCT2 and SLC22A6/OAT1, highlighting the need for ongoing culture optimization.\nDifferentiation toward off-target cell types is also recurrent in standard and PT-enhanced\nkidney organoids. A diverse range of non-kidney cell types arise during hPSC differentiation to\nkidney organoids, such as neural, muscle and cartilage lineages50–52. In PT-enhanced organoids,\nthe characteristic spatially arranged and proximalized nephrons arise from a self-established\ncentralized core of WNT antagonism, which possesses a pre-cartilage population in addition\nto cortical stroma6. Such off-target populations are likely to be problematic for translation\nof this protocol to clinical applications and it is currently unknown whether the organoid\ncell endpoints would be different overall if the nephron progenitor specification steps\ndescribed here were to be incorporated into other kidney organoid protocols. Finally, while\nproximalized nephrons of improved maturity will be of great benefit for a range of disease\nresearch applications, they may not be suitable for approaches requiring the presence of more\ndistal nephron segments beyond the loop of Henle. PT-enhanced organoids possess little\nGATA3 expression, suggesting limited patterning to distal connecting segment6. The current\ninability to simultaneously generate all kidney cell populations in a single differentiation step\nremains a challenge within the kidney organoid field as a whole and further limits nephron\ndevelopment1,2,5,48,49. Critical interactions between cell populations such as ureteric bud or\nnephron progenitors and stroma compartments or the developing nephron53–55 are lacking\nin the organoid environment, thus impacting correct nephron patterning, structure and\nelongation.\n\nExperimental design\nhPSC passaging and expansion in preparation for differentiation\nThis protocol has been successfully applied to a range of human iPSCs6, as well as human ESCs\n(unpublished). The current protocol depicts results generated using two iPSC lines (detailed in\n‘Reagents’), cultured feeder free in TesR-Essential 8(E8) medium with the support of Matrigel\n(Steps 1–9). Passaging is performed at 80% confluency, 2 d before (day −2) differentiation\ninduction, at a 1:3 split ratio to ensure adequate numbers of cells in the exponential growth\nphase before seeding (Fig. 2).\n\nNature Protocols | Volume 18 | November 2023 | 3229–3252 3232",

The iPSCs are consistently seeded for\ndifferentiation onto Laminin-coated 12-well plates 2 d post-passaging, at which time the iPSC\nculture has reached ~80% confluency, at a density of 25,000 cells per well (Steps 10–24). The\nnumber of wells is calculated at Step 10 to ensure adequate organoids for control and test\nconditions in downstream analyses (Steps 54–91), including functional assays (PT-specific\nuptake of fluorescently labeled substrates) and immunofluorescence.\n\nDifferentiation of iPSCs to metanephric mesenchyme and PT-enhanced organoid\ngeneration\nAmongst other differences, the monolayer differentiation stage of this protocol has been\nprolonged compared with our previous methodology9,10, with organoid generation occurring\nat day 13 (Step 31), and utilises both TeSR-E6 and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium/Nutrient\nMixture F12 (DMEM/F12) basal medium. Differentiation is commenced 24 h post-seeding\nby exposing the iPSCs to TeSR-E6 containing 6 µM CHIR99021 followed by 200 ng/mL FGF9\nfor 5 and 2 d, respectively, inducing posterior intermediate mesoderm and metanephric\nmesenchyme (Steps 25–28). Further specification and support of the metanephric mesenchyme\npopulation occurs from day 8 to 13 of differentiation (Step 29) through the addition of nephron\nprogenitor maintenance medium, adapted from a previous method11 to increase BMP7\nlevels6. Organoids are generated at day 13 of differentiation using our standard centrifugation\ntechnique9 with TesR-E6 medium10 and are cultured for 14 d (day 27, representing the D13 + 14\ntimepoint in the original research related to this manuscript6) before collection (Figs. 1 and 2).\nWhile the organoids may be suitable for functional and protein expression analyses described\nbelow at earlier or later timepoints, day 27 is the most frequently assessed timepoint in our\nlaboratory, maximizing the maturation time before off-target populations such as cartilage are\nvisible by brightfield microscopy.\n\nFunctional and protein expression analyses of developed PT-enhanced organoids\nTo establish organoid patterning and maturity, a portion of the organoids are fixed at\nStep 53, 14 d post-aggregation (day 27; representing the D13 + 14 timepoint6), for subsequent\nimmunofluorescence of PT-specific markers (Steps 74–91), while the remaining organoids\nare used for fluorescent substrate uptake assays (Steps 54–73). The albumin uptake assay,\nusing tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated albumin to measure megalin–cubilin\nactivity56, is commenced first to account for its longer duration. During the incubation\nstep with TRITC–albumin, it is possible to complete the assay for PT-specific organic cation\ntransport via Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion Protein 1/2 (MATE-1/MATE-2), which utilizes DAPI\nas a surrogate substrate57. Imaging of the live organoids from both functional assays, as well\nas the fixed organoids following immunofluorescence, are performed using laser scanning\nconfocal microscopy (Steps 61, 73 and 91). The resulting PT-enhanced organoids are considered\nsuccessfully patterned based on the presence of radiating nephrons that take up fluorescently\nlabeled albumin and DAPI (Fig. 3), express PT-specific proteins (Fig. 4) and bind Lotus\ntetragonobulus lectin (LTL) on their apical membrane (Fig. 4).\n\n\nMaterials\n\nReagents\n • DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.
