Procedure
 1 Collect up to three OVB organoids of the same batch in a sterile Rnase-free 1.5 ml tube. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for transferring
 organoids.
 2 Remove any carried-over medium carefully with a 200 µl micropipette tip without disturbing the organoids.
 3 Wash organoids once with cold PBS and withdraw PBS.
 4 Add 300 µl Tri-Reagent and incubate at RT for 5 min.
 5 Vortex tube three times for 5 s.
 6 Incubate the tube at RT for 5 min without agitation.
 7 Vortex tube three times for 5 s.
 8 Keep the tube on ice for 10 min.
 9 Vortex tube three times for 5 s.
10 Keep the tube on ice for 10 min.
 11 Freeze organoids by a snap freeze on dry ice and store them at −80 °C overnight.
 PAUSE POINT Store organoids in Tri-Reagent at −80 °C for up to 6 months.
 j


12 Thaw organoids in Tri-reagent at RT.
 13 Vortex the tube times for 5 s.
14 Pipette remaining cell clumps up and down for complete dissociation with 200 µl micropipette tips (ﬁltered, Rnase-free tip).
15 Perform phenol/chloroform extraction to separate nucleic acids from lipids and proteins. Extract RNA with a commercially available RNA
 extraction kit.
16 Use 2 µg of total RNA to subselect poly(A)+ transcripts and generate strand-speciﬁc cDNA libraries.
17 Sequence libraries to ~50 million read pairs each (75 bp reads) on a HiSeq4000 platform (Illumina).
18 Assess data sequencing quality with FastQC and map paired-end sequencing reads with STAR aligner75 to Hg19 human reference assembly and
 quantiﬁed with featureCounts76.
19 Normalize raw read counts with the RUVSeq77 package in R to remove unwanted variation based on replicate samples (RUVs).
20 Analyze changes in differential gene expression (DGE) with the DESeq2 (ref. 78) package. The list of 3,923 signiﬁcantly DGE genes (log2FC ±1.5
 and padj ≤0.05 cutoff) is subjected to afﬁnity propagation clustering based on similarity matrix, with the APcluster package79.
21 Generate a dendrogram with clusters, cutoff and superclusters, and use these for Gene Ontology term search analysis with clusterProﬁler.
 Classify signiﬁcant DGE genes in superclusters and subject them to gene set enrichment analysis with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
 (ref. 8; v3.0) using C5 collection of Gene Ontology gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database80.

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 Box 7 | Preparation of OVB organoids for TEM ● Timing ~5 d
 Additional reagents
 ● Glutaraldehyde solution (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. G5882)

 ! CAUTION This substance is acutely toxic by inhalation or oral uptake, causes eye damage, respiratory sensitivity and skin sensititvity. Main
 target organ is the respiratory system. It is hazardous for aquatic systems. Use faceshield, gloves and eye protection, and handle under the fume
 hood. Dispose of it in hazardous waste only.
 ● Osmium tetroxide solution (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 75633-2ML; CAS no. 20816-12-0)

 ! CAUTION Acutely toxic by oral uptake or inhalation. Can cause eye damage and skin irritation. It is a very toxic hazardous material, thus use
 faceshields, gloves, eye protection and fume hood when handling.
 ● Propylene oxide (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 1576945; CAS no. 75-56-9)

 ! CAUTION Flammable, acutely toxic by oral uptake or inhalation or skin exposure, and causes eye irritation. This substance is a germ cell
 mutagen and carcinogen. Kepp away from hot surfaces, and wear protective gloves, clothing, eye protection and face protection.
 ● Epoxy systems Araldit G 2 cast resin (Carl Roth, 2545.1)

 ! CAUTION Can cause damage to health, very toxic, can cause irritation to eyes, skin or respiratory organs, Use fume hood, hand and eye
 protection. Resin is harmful to aquatic organisms; dispose in hazardous waste only.
