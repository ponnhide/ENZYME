          "note": "Protocol describes a method for generating striatal neural rosette (SNR)-derived brain organoids with predictable organization and reproducible cellular composition, using vitamin A-containing B27 supplement, no Wnt inhibitors, prolonged FGF2/EGF treatment, and transient trophic factor exposure. Manual SNR isolation introduces variability. Organoids model telencephalic development and neural network maturation up to 5 months. Applications include neurodevelopmental disorder modeling, lineage tracing, and biocomputing. Limitations include manual handling and heterogeneity in SNR isolation."
