 Comparison with other methods for generating telencephalic organoids
 Although multiple protocols have been developed for generating telencephalic brain organoids
 from human PS cells24,26,28,41,66–68, our protocol differs in several important ways. First, while
 most protocols start with dissociated pluripotent or neural stem cell aggregates that result
 in the formation of organoids with multiple rosettes, we start with carefully isolated SNRs.
 Isolated SNRs retain self-organization in suspension culture, giving rise to organoids with
