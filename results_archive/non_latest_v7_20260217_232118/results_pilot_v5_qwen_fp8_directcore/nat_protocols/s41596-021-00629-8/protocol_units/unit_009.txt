15 In the meantime, take a look at the 96-U-well plate under the microscope to check if the hPSC aggregates have properly formed. Mark the properly formed aggregates (these will be further embedded in Matrigel) and cross out the rest (not round or too small aggregates; see Fig. 4b for examples; these aggregates can be discarded later).
CRITICAL STEP Embedding only properly formed aggregates (round, homogeneous, ~550–650 µm in diameter) is important.
