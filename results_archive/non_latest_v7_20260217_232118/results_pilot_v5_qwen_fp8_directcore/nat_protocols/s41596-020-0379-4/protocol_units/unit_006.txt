Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in BME or Matrigel. BME should be kept on ice to prevent it from solidifying; thus, work quickly. The amount of BME depends on the size of the pellet. Approximately 10,000 cells should be plated in 40 µl of BME. Plate the BME containing organoids on the bottom of pre-heated 24-well suspension cell culture plates in drops of ~10 µl each. Place three to four drops into each well.
