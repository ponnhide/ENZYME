Pipette up and down to disrupt BME or Matrigel, and transfer the organoid suspension to a 15-ml conical tube. Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of TrypLE, pipette up and down and incubate at 37 °C until organoids fall apart. Pipette up and down with a P1000 ﬁlter tip with a (non-ﬁltered) P10 tip on top for ≥10 times every 3–5 min to aid disruption of the organoids. Monitor digestion closely to keep the incubation time in TrypLE to a minimum.
