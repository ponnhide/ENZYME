Adaptations possible for corticogenesis, gliogenesis, striatum, thalamus, cerebellum, interneuron migration, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Requires reporter hiPS lines and adapted readouts. Applicable to human embryonic stem cell cultures. Captures human-specific disease context."

Neural organoids/assembloids enable study of complex developmental processes. CRISPR + scRNA-seq profiles transcriptional consequences but is low-throughput. This protocol uses bulk genomic DNA sequencing for scalable genome-wide screening and couples with phenotypic assessments."

Batch variability in organoids necessitates QC at multiple stages and biological replicates. Heterogeneous gene disruption complicates genotype-phenotype correlation."
