For quality control and filtering of HNOCA, we removed any cells with fewer than 200 genes expressed. We next removed outlier cells in terms of two quality control metrics: the number of expressed genes and percentage mitochondrial counts. To define outlier cells on the basis of each quality control metric, a z-transformation is first applied to values across all cells. Cells with any z-transformed metric less than −1.96 or greater than 1.96 are defined as outliers.
