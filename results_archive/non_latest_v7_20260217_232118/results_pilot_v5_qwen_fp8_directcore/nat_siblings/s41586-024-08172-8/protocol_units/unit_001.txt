We included 33 human neural organoid data from a total of 25 publications1–24,26 plus three unpublished datasets in our atlas (Supplementary Table 1). We curated all neural organoid datasets used in this study through the sfaira78 framework (GitHub dev branch, 18 April 2023). For this, we obtained scRNA-seq count matrices and associated metadata from the location provided in the data availability section for every included publication or directly from the authors in case of unpublished data. We harmonized metadata according to the sfaira standards (https://sfaira.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adding_datasets.html) and manually curated an extra metadata column organoid_age_days, which described the number of days the organoid had been in culture before collection.
