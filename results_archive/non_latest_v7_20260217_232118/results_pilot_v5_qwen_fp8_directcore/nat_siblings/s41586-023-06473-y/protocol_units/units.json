In this assay, a pre-assembled array of gRNA-targeting sequences fused with TagBFP is used to generate 3T3 fibroblast reporter cell lines. sgRNA and eCas9 are then delivered into the reporter cell lines by lentiviruses. Successful genome editing causes frameshift mutations, resulting in the loss of blue fluorescent protein (BFP) fluorescence, which enables the quantitative evaluation of gRNA efficiency (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c), although it does not allow for the determination of whether a heterozygous or homozygous mutation was introduced.",
