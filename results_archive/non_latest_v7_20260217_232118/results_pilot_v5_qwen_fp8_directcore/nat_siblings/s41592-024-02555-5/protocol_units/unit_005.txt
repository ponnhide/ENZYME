We thus set out to develop a new method, SCanSNP (Fig. 3a), to overcome the observed limitations by (1) dividing the classification challenge into two steps, one for identity assignment and one for doublet detection and (2) measuring the genetic purity of each droplet to identify low-quality droplets and separate them from authentic doublets.
