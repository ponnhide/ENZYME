The pellet was then resuspended in 10 mL PBS+++, ﬁltered through a 100 µm cell strainer, and centrifuged for 3 min at 4 °C, 500. The tissue was then ready for plating in Matrigel (Corning) by resuspending in cold Matrigel and plating into 30 μL Matrigel droplets, at a density of 30–50 crypts per droplet. Once Matrigel had solidiﬁed for 30 min at 37 °C, crypts were fed with organoid growth media.
