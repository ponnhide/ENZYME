For apoptosis quantiﬁcation, organoids were incubated in CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Detection Reagent (Thermo Fisher) diluted in media according to manufacturer protocols for 30 min in the microwell plates. Organoids were then washed with PBS and imaged on a Nikon spinning disc confocal to collect ﬂuorescence and DIC images. The % area of caspase was quantiﬁed using FIJI66 as the area of organoid stained positive for Caspase-3/7 divided by the total area of the organoid from DIC images.
