Organoid permeability and apoptosis measurements were conducted on one day post-injury, and FITC-dextran was used to assess barrier integrity. Briefly, organoids were incubated in a solution of 4kDA FITC-Dextran (MedChemExpress) diluted to 2 mg/mL in PBS for 5 min in µ-slides (Ibidi) to allow organoids to settle to the bottom of the slide. Organoids were then imaged on a Nikon spinning disc confocal to collect ﬂuorescence and DIC images, and the percentage of intact organoids was calculated as the number of organoids per condition/donor that excluded FITC-dextran from the lumen divided by the total number of organoids.
