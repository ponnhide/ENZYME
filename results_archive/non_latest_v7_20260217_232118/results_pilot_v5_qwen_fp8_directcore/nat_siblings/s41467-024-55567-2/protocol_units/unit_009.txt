For the construction of a ﬂuorescent reporter, an LGR5-P2A-mNeonGreen knock-in reporter was introduced into the last exon of LGR5 via electroporation, using previously published sgRNA (Supplementary Table 1) and homology arms (Supplementary Table 2). The LGR5 sgRNA plasmids and HDR template were co-electroporated into human intestinal organoids using a NEPA21 electroporator (Nepa Gene) following published methods.
