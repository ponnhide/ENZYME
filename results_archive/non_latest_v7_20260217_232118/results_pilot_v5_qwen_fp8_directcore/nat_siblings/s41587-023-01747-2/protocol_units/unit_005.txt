We established a panel of 63 antibodies covering major retinal cell types, subcellular compartments, morphological structures and signaling pathways split into three color channels (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 1d–f). Thirty-two global MTUs resolve the tissue structure with image quality and label biological structures in individual samples.
