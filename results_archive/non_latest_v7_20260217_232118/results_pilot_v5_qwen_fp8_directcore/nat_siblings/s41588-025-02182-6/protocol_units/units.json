Housing rooms employ centrally controlled and monitored light cycles that\n utilize a 12-hour light / 12-hour dark photoperiod. Temperatures are maintained within plus or minus 2 degrees throughout a range\n of ~18-26°C with 30-70% humidity.\n\n Wild animals We do not use wild animals in this study.\n\n Reporting on sex Mice were solely used for transplantation experiments for human organoids and we therefore did not analyze any potentially male or\n female biased mouse gene expression data of either sex in this study.\n\n Field-collected samples We do not use field-collected samples in this study.\n\n Ethics oversight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol # PRO00006609)\n\nNote that full information on the approval of the study protocol must also be provided in the manuscript.\n\n\nPlants\n Seed stocks Report on the source of all seed stocks or other plant material used. If applicable, state the seed stock centre and catalogue number. If\n plant specimens were collected from the field, describe the collection location, date and sampling procedures.\n\n Novel plant genotypes Describe the methods by which all novel plant genotypes were produced. This includes those generated by transgenic approaches,\n gene editing, chemical/radiation-based mutagenesis and hybridization. For transgenic lines, describe the transformation method, the\n number of independent lines analyzed and the generation upon which experiments were performed. For gene-edited lines, describe\n the editor used, the endogenous sequence targeted for editing, the targeting guide RNA sequence (if applicable) and how the editor\n was applied.\n Authentication Describe any authentication procedures for each seed stock used or novel genotype generated. Describe any experiments used to\n assess the effect of a mutation and, where applicable, how potential secondary effects (e.g. second site T-DNA insertions, mosiacism,\n off-target gene editing) were examined.\n\n\n April 2023\n\n\n 4",
