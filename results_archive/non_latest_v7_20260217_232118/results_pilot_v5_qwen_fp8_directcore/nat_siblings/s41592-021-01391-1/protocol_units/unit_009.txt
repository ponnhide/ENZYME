We were able to improve the detectable number of transcripts per cell as compared with published Drop-seq data-sets on HEK 293T cells by exploiting the uniquely low number of beads in DisCo samples (<500), which enabled us to identify and merge closely related barcodes (described in Methods) without compromising single cell purity.
