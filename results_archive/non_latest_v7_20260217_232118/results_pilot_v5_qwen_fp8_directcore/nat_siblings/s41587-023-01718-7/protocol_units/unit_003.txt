To functionally validate the fate potential of different progenitor populations in epicardioids, we generated an hiPSC reporter line in which a flippase (FLP) recognition target (FRT)-flanked neomycin cassette blocking transcription of a pCAG-driven fluorescent reporter (mKate2) fused to a hemagglutinin (HA) tag was knocked into the AAVS1 safe harbor locus49.
