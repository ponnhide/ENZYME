Kidney tubule AFOs (KAFOs) expanded long-term (up to passage 10), while maintaining proliferation (Ki67; Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 4a) and mostly manifested a compact morphology with several lines showing a cystic structure. Bulk RNA-seq of 54 KAFOs (19 AF samples; 18–34 weeks GA) showed expression of canonical developmental renal epithelial and nephron progenitor genes (PAX2, PAX8, LHX1 and JAG1), while lacking cap mesenchyme markers (SIX2, CITED1 and GDNF).
