Normalization across genes was applied by subtracting the gene’s median expression from individual expression values.
For each tumour clone we calculated a set of genes differentially expressed compared to all normal clones pooled together. Genes were called as differentially expressed if they had an FDR-corrected P value less than 0.05, resulting
