Crypt isolation and organoid culture
Tissues were transferred into Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline Enterocytes. EGF (50 ng/mL), IGF-I (100 ng/mL), FGF-2 (50 ng/mL),
(DPBS) and placed on ice until processing. Crypt isolation was SJ000291942 (10 μM), Gastrin I (10 nM), A83-01 (0.5 μM), IWR-1 (2 μM)
performed as previously reported45 with modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, tis- and VPA (0.75 mM) for 3 days.
sues were washed with DPBS to remove debris. The tissues were
treated with 2.5 mM EDTA at 4 °C for 40 minutes to release crypts. M cells. TNF-α (50 ng/mL) treated for the ﬁrst 4 hours and RANKL
The supernatant containing crypts was collected and embedded in (100 ng/mL) for total 3 days.

changed every 3 days.
