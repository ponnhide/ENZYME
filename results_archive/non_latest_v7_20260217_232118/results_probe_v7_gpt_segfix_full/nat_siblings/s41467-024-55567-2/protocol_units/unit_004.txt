ctroporated into human intestinal CHIR (4 μM), DAPT (10 μM), pVc (100 μg/mL) and IL-22 (2 ng/mL).
Organoids were randomly taken from whole wells without being seg-
mented and dissociated from the BME with TrypLE and dissociated into single cells. Cells were washed with ice-cold DPBS and ﬁltered into (ApexBio), 0.5 μM A83-01 (ApexBio), and 3 μM CHIR (ApexBio) were ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) tubes through a 40 μm cell strainer (Falcon). Cells were stained with Hoechst (Beyotime) to identify live cells before FACS analysis.
