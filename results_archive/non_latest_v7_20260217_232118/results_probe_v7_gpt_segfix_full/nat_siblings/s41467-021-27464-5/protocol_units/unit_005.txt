Cells with neuronal morphology and round cell body were selected for recordings. Resting-membrane potentials were monitored immediately after breaking-in in current-clamp mode. Thereafter, cells were kept at a membrane potential of −60 mV to −80 mV, and 500 ms currents were injected from −85 pA to +165 pA with 20 pA increments to induce action potentials.
