Calcium imaging of MAP2–GCamP5-labeled neurons. Calcium imaging was performed at day 120 of VM cultures containing the MAP2‐GCamP5 reporter. Images were captured on an inverted Ti2 microscope (Nikon) equipped with a CSU‑W1 spinning‑disc system, a sCMOS camera (Andor Neo) and 20× objective. An environment control chamber was used to maintain the temperature at 37 °C and CO2 level at 5% during imaging.
