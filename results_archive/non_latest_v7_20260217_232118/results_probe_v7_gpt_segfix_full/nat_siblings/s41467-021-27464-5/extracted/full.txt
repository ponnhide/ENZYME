 Three-dimensional brain organoids have emerged as a valuable model system for studies of
 human brain development and pathology. Here we establish a midbrain organoid culture
 system to study the developmental trajectory from pluripotent stem cells to mature dopa-
 mine neurons. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we identify the presence of three mole-
 cularly distinct subtypes of human dopamine neurons with high similarity to those in
 developing and adult human midbrain. However, despite signiﬁcant advancements in the
 ﬁeld, the use of brain organoids can be limited by issues of reproducibility and incomplete
 maturation which was also observed in this study. We therefore designed bioengineered
 ventral midbrain organoids supported by recombinant spider-silk microﬁbers functionalized
 with full-length human laminin. We show that silk organoids reproduce key molecular aspects
 of dopamine neurogenesis and reduce inter-organoid variability in terms of cell type com-
 position and dopamine neuron formation.
