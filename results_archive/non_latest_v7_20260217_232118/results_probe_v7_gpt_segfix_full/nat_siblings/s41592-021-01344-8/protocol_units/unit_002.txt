including EB formation (day 4), neural induction (day 7), neuroepithelium development (day 15) and neurogenesis (days 20 and 30).
we established ‘Spatial iTracer’, which uses spatial transcripinduction (day 7), neuroepithelium development (day 15) and neu- tome sequencing based on the 10x Visium platform to measure gene
