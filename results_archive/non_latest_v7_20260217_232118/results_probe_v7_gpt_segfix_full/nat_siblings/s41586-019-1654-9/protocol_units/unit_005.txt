Then, sections were incubated in antigen retrieval solution (HistoVT One, ...) at 70 °C for 20 min.
Organoid pieces were incubated in Papain at 37 °C (enzyme mix 1) for an 1:1,000, followed by addition of Enzyme A (enzyme mix 2) to the Papain mix. Organoid pieces were then triturated using wide-bore 1,000‑µl tips and incubated for additional intervals of 5–10 min.
