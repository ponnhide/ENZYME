To generate clonal tumor organoid lines, early passage tumor organoids were dissociated into single cells by TryPLE (Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc), washed and suspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 2 mM ETDA and 5% FCS). Prior to FACS puriﬁcation, DAPI was added to the FACS buffer. HLA‑A2+ single cells were sorted into separate wells of 96‑well plates containing 100 µl HISCM with 10 µM LY27632 and coated with BME. Sorted cells were then covered with 10 µl BME and placed in the incubator at 37 °C.
