Organoids were lysed by gentle vortexing in 8 M Urea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate supplemented with 50 µg/ml DNAse I (Sigma‑Aldrich), 50 µg/ml RNAse A (Sigma‑Aldrich) and 1× complete EDTA‑free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Subsequently, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 1 h at 18,000 g at 15 °C. Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay.
