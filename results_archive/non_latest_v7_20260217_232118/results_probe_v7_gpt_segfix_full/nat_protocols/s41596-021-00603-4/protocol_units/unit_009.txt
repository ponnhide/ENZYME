21 Centrifuge cells at 800g for 5 min at room temperature, discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 50 µl of CSB.
22 Prepare extracellular antibody cocktail by mixing the antibody panel (see Supplementary Table 2 for an example) at desired concentrations in CSB (total volume up to 50 µl).
23 Add the extracellular antibody cocktail to the cells, mix thoroughly by pipetting and incubate for 30 min on a rocker at room temperature.
24 Add 2 ml of CSB to the cells, centrifuge at 800g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.
