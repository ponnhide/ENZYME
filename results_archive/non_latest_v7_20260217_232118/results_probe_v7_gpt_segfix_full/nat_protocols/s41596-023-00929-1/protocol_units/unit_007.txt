46. Set the laser levels for each of your fluorophores with unstained and single-color controls.
47. Once the laser levels are set, then run the single-color controls again to record each
 fluorophore. After every single-color control has been run, the machine can perform
 compensation, the method of correcting for fluorescence spill over.
48. Once the laser levels are set and compensation performed, the user can draw gates to select
 sequential populations (Fig. 3a). For this strategy, we recommend first eliminating debris
 with side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) gates. These are size and complexity
 parameters.
49. Next, eliminate doublets also with SSC or FSC.
50. Eliminate dead cells. We use DAPI but a number of live/dead stains exist in different
 fluorophores.
51. After eliminating debris, doublets and dead cells, then the user should set up
 FACS plots to select their population of interests. In our studies, endothelial
 cells were isolated as CD45−CD31+ANPEP− and mural cells were isolated as
 CD45−CD31−ANPEP+.
52. (Optional) Run additional controls to determine the true population. These may include
 ‘fluorescence minus one’ controls and unstained controls.
53. After the population has been defined, use a 100 µm nozzle to perform cell sorting.
 ▲ Critical step A smaller filter may damage the cells.
54. Translate the ‘event number’ readout from the cell sorter into a true cell number,
 a parameter termed ‘efficiency’21. This calculation may be necessary for downstream
 applications.
