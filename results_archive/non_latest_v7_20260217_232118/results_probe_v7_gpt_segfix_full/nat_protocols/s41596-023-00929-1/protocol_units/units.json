See also the troubleshooting advice for Steps 9 and 54.\n6. With a scalpel, cut tissue into small (~2 mm × 2 mm chunks) in HBSS/BSA/glucose + DNase\n solution in a sterile environment (Fig. 2).\n ▲ Critical step Ideal, dissection should occur in a cell culture biosafety cabinet. If this\n is not possible, the tissue can be dissected outside of a hood with attention paid to best\n aseptic technique.\n7. Distribute tissue into three 15 mL conical tubes.\n • Aliquot the tissue–buffer solution in the dish into the tubes first\n • Use extra HBSS/BSA/glucose buffer to wash the dish and make up to\n 5 mL per tube\n8.

Digest for 30 min in rotating oven at 37 °C.\n ▲ Critical step Optimal enzymatic digestion is the most important factor\n to maximize yield. Therefore, this step may need optimizing to achieve\n sufficient but not too much digestion. See also the troubleshooting advice\n for Step 54.",

Once the laser levels are set and compensation performed, the user can draw gates to select\n sequential populations (Fig. 3a).
