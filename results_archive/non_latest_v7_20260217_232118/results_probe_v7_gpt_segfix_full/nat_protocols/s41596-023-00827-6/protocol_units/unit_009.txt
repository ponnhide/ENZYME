101 One night before embedding, thaw the desired amount of Matrigel (150 μl/insert) as described in ‘Reagent setup’.
CRITICAL STEP Keep Matrigel on ice during the entire procedure to avoid polymerization.
102 On the day of use, prepare 50 ml of the ventralization medium/branching medium as described in ‘Reagent setup’.
103 Add 100 μl per well of the ventralization medium/branching medium to a 96-well U-bottom non‑tissue culture‑treated plate.
104 Select the organoids with folding structures under a microscope in a picking hood. One six-well plate should contain hundreds to thousands of organoids. Organoids with folding epithelial structures will gradually form and the majority should adopt this morphology after d15 (Figs. 1b, vi and 3b).
105 Typically, one to four organoids will go on to be plated in each 24-well insert. First, put this desired number of organoids per insert into each well of a 96-well U-bottom non‑tissue culture‑treated plate and set aside.
106 Place 24-well inserts into non‑tissue culture‑treated plates.
107 Layer 50 μl of 100% cold Matrigel into the bottom of each insert.
CRITICAL STEP The Matrigel should be distributed evenly to cover the entire surface of the insert. If not, tap the plate to spread the Matrigel before it polymerizes.
108 Wait 5 min or until the Matrigel has solidiﬁed.
109 Gently remove as much of the ventralization medium/branching medium as possible from the 96-well plate (from Step 105), one well at a time.
110 Use a P1000 tip to quickly take ~30–50 μl of 100% cold Matrigel.
111 Mix the organoids with the cold Matrigel gently to avoid creating bubbles.
112 Pick up the organoids and immediately but slowly put the organoid–Matrigel mixture in the center of an insert.
113 Wait 5 min for the Matrigel to solidify to secure the organoids in the center of the insert.
114 Add another 50 μl of 100% cold Matrigel to the insert to create a Matrigel sandwich.
115 Put the plates in a normoxic incubator for 10 min to make sure all Matrigel has solidiﬁed.
