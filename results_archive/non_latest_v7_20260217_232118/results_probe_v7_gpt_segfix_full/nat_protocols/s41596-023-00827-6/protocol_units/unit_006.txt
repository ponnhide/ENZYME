1 Remove the insert from the 24-well plate, invert it and gently peel off the membrane from the bottom of the insert using forceps.
2 Carefully place the insert with the membrane removed over the mouth of an open, empty 15 ml centrifuge tube.
3 Add 1 ml of cell recovery reagent to the insert such that the embedded organoid with Matrigel falls into the 15 ml centrifuge tube.
4 Close the 15 ml centrifuge tube and immediately place on ice to depolymerize the Matrigel.
5 Every 20 min, gently shake the tube to check if the Matrigel has dissolved and place it back on ice.
6 Once the Matrigel has dissolved, add 10 ml of wash medium to the tube. Time varies from ~45 min to 1 h depending on Matrigel thickness.
7 Centrifuge at 200g for 5 min.
8 Aspirate the wash medium and cell recovery reagent and add 1 ml of Accutase to the organoid and incubate at 37 °C.
CRITICAL STEP Avoid using trypsin to dissociate the organoid as it is too harsh and the chances of losing fragile cell types is higher.
9 Gently shake the tube to disturb/dissociate the organoid every 5 min and replace the tube at 37 °C for 10–12 min. Time varies depending on the organoid size and density.
10 When the organoid is dissociated add 10 ml wash medium and centrifuge at 400g for 4 min.
11 Aspirate the wash medium and resuspend the pellet in base medium.
CRITICAL STEP Check the base medium compatibility with the sequencing technology to be used for scRNAseq.
