3 Transfer the mixture into a Zymo-Spin IC Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30 s at 16,000g. Transfer the column into a new collection tube and discard the ﬂow through.
4 In an RNase-free tube, add 5 μl DNase I (6 U/μl), 35 μl DNA Digestion Buffer and mix by gentle inversion. Add the mix directly to the column matrix. Incubate at room temperature (20–30 °C) for 15 min.
5 Add 400 μl Direct-zol RNA PreWash to the column and centrifuge. Discard the ﬂow through and repeat this step.
6 Add 700 μl RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 1 min to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Transfer the column carefully into an RNase-free tube.
