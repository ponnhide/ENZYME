14 Before you start, take out the required amount of Matrigel aliquots from the freezer and let them thaw on ice. When the Matrigel is thawed, insert the aliquots into the ice. Take out the sterile scissors (heated to at least 180 °C for at least 3 h), and let them cool down at room temperature.

CRITICAL STEP Ensure the Matrigel is not growth-factor-reduced (use cat. no. 354234).

18 Pick a properly formed aggregate. To do this, use the cut tip (fr ... droplet from the plate bottom. Steps 16–19 are shown in Supplementary Video 2 and are schematically depicted in Fig. 4c.

20 Repeat Steps 17–19 until all aggregates are embedded. Use a new tip for every Matrigel droplet. The cut tip does not necessarily have to be changed. Afterward, place the plate into the incubator for 50–60 min to let the Matrigel solidify.

21 Add 100 µL E8 per well. A multichannel pipet can be used in this step. Add the medium slowly and carefully, depressing the plunger of the pipet only until the ﬁrst stop to prevent damage and ﬂoating of the Matrigel droplets. Place the plate back into the incubator.
