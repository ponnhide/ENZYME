2 Take the conﬂuent T25 ﬂask (Fig. 3b; conﬂuency is typically reached 2–4 d after seeding), aspirate the medium and add 5 mL of PBS w/o. Aspirate the PBS w/o, add 1 mL of Accutase and place the plate into the incubator.

3 Add 5 mL of DMEM/F12 to the ﬂask, and rinse the ﬂask bottom with the medium to detach the cells. Transfer the resulting cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube, and centrifuge the tube at 300g for 3 min at 4 °C.

4 Remove the supernatant, and gently resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of E8 + 10 μM Y27632.

5 Count the cells and assess the cell viability by applying Trypan blue staining in a hemocytometer using standard methods (and previously described33).

6 Take a prepared Geltrex-coated T25 ﬂask, aspirate the medium and add 5 mL E8 + 10 μM Y27632.

7 Add 0.5–1.0 × 10^6 cells to the ﬂask, and place it into the incubator. Move the ﬂask a few times back and forth and left to right at the point where it is placed in the incubator to ensure that the cells are equally distributed (Supplementary Video 1).

8 Change the medium after 2 d and then daily by aspirating the medium and adding 5 mL of fresh E8 (Y27632 is only required for cell seeding and so is not needed).
