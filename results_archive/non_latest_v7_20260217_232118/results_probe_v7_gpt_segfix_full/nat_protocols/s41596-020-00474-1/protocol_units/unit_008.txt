41 Tilt the plate at a 45° angle and aspirate all expansion medium from the well containing cultured organoids by placing the aspiration tip to the side of the well. Avoid getting close to the BME drops.
CRITICAL Use a clean tip for each different organoid culture and remove the lid from one culture plate at a time to avoid cross-contamination.
42 Tilt the plate at a 45° angle and gently add dropwise 750 μl of expansion medium to each well using a P1000 pipette when refreshing a few wells or a 5-ml or 100-ml sterile serological pipette when refreshing many wells. Aim at the bottom corner of the well to avoid disturbing the BME drops.
CRITICAL Do not touch the well while adding expansion medium to avoid cross-contamination.
