22 Pre-wet a 100-µm strainer by pipetting 10 ml of D-BSA on the strainer into a new 50-ml Falcon tube. Swirl the 50-ml tube to wet the sides of the tube and discard the D-BSA. Then, strain the digested tissue over the 100-µm strainer into the 50-ml Falcon tube (both pre-wetted with D-BSA).
23 Transfer the unﬁltered tissue pieces back into the initial 50-ml Falcon tube by reversing the ﬁlter and ﬂushing with 10 ml of D-BSA.
24 Pipette the digested tissue up and down vigorously, using a 10-ml sterile serological pipette pre-wetted with D-BSA.
