34 Resuspend the pellet in an appropriate amount of BME. As a guideline, 200 µl is sufﬁcient for a pellet of ~50 µl. The amount of BME to add scales linearly with the pellet volume.
CRITICAL After ﬁltering the digested tissue, the cell pellet should be easy to resuspend in BME.
However, if the pellet is very sticky, cut the tip of the 200-µl low-retention ﬁlter tip.
CRITICAL BME must be kept on ice to prevent solidiﬁcation. Work quickly to prevent the BME from solidifying but carefully to prevent bubble formation.
35 Plate 100 µl of
36 Turn the plate upside down and leave in the biosafety cabinet for 5 min.
37 Transfer the plate, upside down, into a 37 °C incubator and leave to solidify for 30 min.
CRITICAL Solidifying the BME upside down prevents the tissue fragments from sinking and attaching to the bottom of the plate.
38 Add 750 µl of pre-warmed (RT to 37 °C) Type 1 or Type 2 medium to each well and transfer to an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Refer to Table 3 for appropriate media volumes per type of culture plate.
