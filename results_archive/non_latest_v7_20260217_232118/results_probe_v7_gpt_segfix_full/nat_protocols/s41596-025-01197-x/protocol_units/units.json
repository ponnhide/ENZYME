Moreover, genetic abnormalities detected in patients with\nneurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders may alter the human-specific aspects of\nneurodevelopment; therefore, human-based models are needed to study human brain\ndevelopment under normal and pathological conditions8,9.\n Primary human fetal brain tissue obtained from terminated pregnancies has been\neffectively used to study early stages of fetal human telencephalic brain development10–13.\nThese studies identified human-specific brain cells and characterized the cell type-specific\ngenes and gene networks associated with the specification and development of these cells.\nIn parallel, postmortem brain tissue from patients is utilized to identify cells and molecular\npathways that are disrupted in the adult human cortex in association with various brain\ndisorders14–16. However, important limitations of these approaches include that fetal brain tissue\nis rarely available from patients with specific genetic abnormalities, and neither the fetal nor\nadult tissues are amenable to genetic manipulations in long-term mechanistic experiments.\n To overcome these limitations, new methods and protocols have been developed to\ndifferentiate and reprogram human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem (PS) cells into\ndifferent types of telencephalic neural cell, including neural progenitors, excitatory and\ninhibitory neurons, and glial cells, in vitro17–23. The use of these approaches in research has\nallowed the discovery as well as genetic manipulation of the properties of patient-specific\nneural cells and the identification of disease-related phenotypes and mechanisms. However,\ndespite many advantages of two-dimensional cultures in mechanistic experiments, they are\nnot well-suited for neurodevelopment as they lack other telencephalic cell types and specific\norganization present during brain development.\n Self-organized telencephalic brain tissues, collectively termed telencephalic brain\norganoids here, recapitulate many important aspects of fetal human telencephalic\ndevelopment, including cell-type specification, development and organization, and have\nalready been used for disease modeling24–29, leading to new insights into the cellular and\nmolecular mechanisms of human brain development in health and disease (reviewed in\nrefs. 8,9,30–36). Although the overall enthusiasm for studying human brain development\nusing brain organoids is on the rise, the approach has several notable limitations—including\nthe variability of cellular composition and organization37, impaired specification of humanspecific neural progenitors and late-born superficial layer cortical neurons38, as well as\ndisrupted cortical lamination39 and impaired functional maturation of neurons and neural\nnetworks37,40–42—which limit the use of organoids in research.\n In contrast to many of these previous methods, which include multiple neural rosettes (NRs)\nper organoid, we recently developed a method for generating telencephalic brain organoids\nfrom human stem cell-derived single neural rosettes (SNRs)43. NRs are spontaneously organized\nthree-dimensional multicellular structures that resemble a cross-section of the neural tube and\nemerge in vitro upon the successful differentiation of PS cells into neuroectodermal lineage\ncells44–46. We demonstrated that starting organoid formation from SNRs leads to predictably\norganized telencephalic organoids with reproducible cellular composition and functional\nneural networks. Unlike other brain organoid models, SNR-derived organoids contain both\npallial and subpallial lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE)-like neural progenitors, cortical and\nstriatal neurons, as well as periendothelial and ependymal cells. Here, we outline the rationale\nbehind generating organoids from isolated SNRs and discuss the advantages, limitations\nand potential applications of this method. We also detail the experimental procedures for\ngenerating SNR-derived organoids from control and CRISPR–Cas9-edited stem cell lines\nand their use for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), immunohistochemistry and slice\npatch-clamp electrophysiology.",

      "text": "Protocol\n\nDevelopment of the protocol\nRationale for generating organoids from SNRs\nDuring the early stages of human embryonic development (18–19 d post-conception),\ngastrulation results in the formation of three germ cell layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and\nendoderm47. As development progresses, ectodermal cells undergo extensive proliferation and\nform the neural plate (20–21 d post-conception), which is followed by the formation of neural\nfolds (22–23 d post-conception) and then a singular neural tube (25–26 d post-conception) that\nextends throughout the entire embryo. The wall of the neural tube comprises polarized and\npseudostratified neuroepithelial cells that are the earliest neural progenitors in the developing\nhuman embryo. Proper neural tube formation is vital for normal embryonic development,\nas neural tube formation abnormalities are known to lead to different birth defects, such\nas anencephaly, spina bifida and encephalocele. Remarkably, neural tube-like structures,\ntermed ‘neural rosettes’, can be spontaneously generated from PS cells in vitro during neural\ndifferentiation44–46. We hypothesized that isolated SNRs could be used as a starting material for\ngenerating predictably organized brain organoids with a singular neural tube-like structure\nto mimic the natural development of neural tissue from the singular neural tube. Importantly,\nmultiple rosette-like structures in neural tissue have been observed in association with brain\ntumors48, which may affect neuronal differentiation, migration and maturation49. In the\nfollowing sections, we provide the rationale for using specific procedures and reagents during\nthe generation of SNRs and SNR-derived organoids from human PS cells (Fig. 1).\n\nNeural induction\nEfficient neural induction of PS cells in vitro can be achieved through the use of dual-SMAD\ninhibition via co-application of a BMP–SMAD1/5/8 inhibitor, such as Noggin, LDN193189 or\ndorsomorphin, and an inhibitor of the TGF-β–activin–NODAL–SMAD2/3 signaling pathway,\nsuch as SB-431542 (ref. 18). The dual-SMAD inhibitors induce the neuralization of ectodermal\ntissue while destabilizing the pluripotency gene expression networks and suppressing the\ninduction of mesodermal fates in PS cells. Thus, we use the dual-SMAD inhibitors dorsomorphin\n(4 μM) and SB-431542 (10 μM) in neurobasal media with the vitamin A-containing B27\nsupplement for neural induction (Figs. 1 and 2a–c). Notably, no other organoid generation\nprotocols use vitamin A-containing B27, as vitamin A is a precursor of retinoic acid, which is\nknown to induce neural tissue caudalization50. However, we detected no or few cells expressing\ncaudal markers, such as EN1, FOXA2, GBX2, PAX2, and HOXA2 and HOXA1, in SNR-derived\norganoids grown in media with vitamin A-containing B27 (ref. 43), suggesting that a higher\nconcentration of retinoic acid is probably necessary to induce the caudalization of neural\ntissue. Our rationale for using vitamin A-containing B27 was to promote intermediate neural\nprogenitor specification and corticogenesis51,52.\n Another important distinction of our neural induction protocol is that we use no\nWnt inhibitors. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for supporting neural progenitor\nproliferation53,54 and dorsal telencephalic patterning55,56, while Wnt inhibitors are known to\npromote the ventralization of telencephalic tissue57,58. We decided to rely on endogenous\nmorphogens, such as BMP7 and Wnt antagonists SFRP1 and FRZB, which have been detected\nin SNR-derived organoids43, to induce the default neurodevelopmental program for the\nspecification of telencephalic cell fates17,57. Finally, to stimulate the proliferation of newly\ndifferentiated neuroectodermal cells and facilitate their adoption of radial glial identity,\nwe treat the cultures of neuroepithelial cells with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2, 10 ng/mL)\nand epidermal growth factor (EGF, 10 ng/mL)59,60. In our preliminary experiments, we noticed\nthat cultures without FGF2 exhibit impaired NR formation, limited organoid growth and\nincreased cell death. The emergence of neural rosettes is typically observed at 6–8 d post\nEGF/FGF2-treatment initiation (Fig. 2d).\n\nNRs\nEach NR is a self-organized, three-dimensional, multicellular structure consisting of\nneuroepithelial and radial glial cells that are radially distributed around a central lumen\n(Fig. 2e). NR cells undergo interkinetic nuclear migration between the basal (outer) and apical",

During this time, the majority\nof SNRs grow in size, reaching 400–700 μm in diameter by the end of 2 weeks, and transform\ninto organoids with a singular lumen (Fig. 3).

This mimics the natural development of neural\ntissue from the neural tube. Second, in contrast to other protocols, our approach involves\nthe use of (1) vitamin A-containing B27 supplement, (2) no Wnt inhibitors, (3) prolonged\nearly treatment with FGF2 and EGF and (4) late, transient exposure to trophic factors (Fig. 1).\nOur reasoning for introducing these specific modifications is described in the preceding section.\n Recently, several methods have been developed for more efficient SNR generation from\nstem cells (without mechanical dissection from NR clusters)65,69,70. In line with our findings, these\nstudies reported reproducible cell composition and predictable cell organization in SNRs and\nearly SNR-derived organoids. In contrast to our study, these studies did not apply FGF2 and EGF\ntreatment and MG embedding to promote the proliferation of neural progenitors in SNRs and\nSNR-derived organoids and obtained relatively small-size organoids (<1.2 mm in diameter by\n5 months) with inconsistent organization and impeded functional maturation of neurons and\nneural networks65.\n\nPotential applications and adaptations\nOur approach for generating organoids can be useful for modeling both normal human\ntelencephalic development and neurodevelopmental disorders43,71. We demonstrated that the\ncomposition of cells in 1-month-old SNR-derived organoids is highly reproducible, consisting of\ntelencephalic neural progenitors and both inhibitory and excitatory neurons. This allowed us to\nstudy the specification of different types of neural progenitors and neurons in the developing\ntelencephalon. Using scRNA-seq-based computational lineage tracing72, we identified signaling\npathways that are associated with the specification of excitatory and inhibitory neural lineages\nfrom a common pool of unspecified neural progenitors. A similar approach can be used to\nelucidate the specification of other cell types in the developing human telencephalon under\nnormal and pathological conditions, including different subtypes of excitatory and inhibitory\nneurons and outer radial glia cells that were also detected in 1-month-old SNR-derived\norganoids43.\n In addition, we showed that 5-month-old organoids consist of a diversity of neural cells,\nincluding excitatory and inhibitory neural progenitors, deep- and superficial layer cortical\nexcitatory neurons, LGE-derived inhibitory interneurons, primary striatal inhibitory neurons,\nand astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and periendothelial and ependymal cells. Remarkably,\nependymal cells line the lumen in 5-month-old SNR-derived organoids, cortical excitatory\nneurons exhibit lamination and primary striatal inhibitory neurons are largely distributed\nunderneath the cortical layers. These results suggest that 5-month-old SNR-derived organoids\ncan be used for studying cortical lamination and the specification of glial, periendothelial and\nependymal cells.\n Finally, we found that 5-month-old SNR-derived organoids consist of a relatively large\nproportion of functionally mature neurons that generate action potentials, receive both\nexcitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, and demonstrate functional neural networks,\nsuggesting that these organoids can be useful for studying the establishment and function of\nneural networks in the developing human brain under normal and pathological conditions8.\n We envision that the SNR-based approach can also be used for generating other brain\nregion-specific organoids, such as striatal, thalamic, cerebellar and midbrain organoids,\nwith a predictable organization that could further be used for assembling multi-brain regioncontaining organoids, as it has already been done for multi-rosette-containing organoids73–76.\nSuch organoids will be useful for studying inter-regional brain communication, including\nmigration and connectivity31,77. In addition, brain organoids with predictable organization and\nreproducible cellular composition could be useful for building new biocomputers for artificial\nintelligence-related applications78.\n\nLimitations\nThe limitations of our approach include the use of manual procedures for SNR isolation and\nthe heterogeneity of isolated SNRs in terms of size, shape and quality, which could contribute\nto organoid-to-organoid variability (Figs. 3 and 4).

Thus, it is expected that some initially isolated SNR-containing tissue may\ncontain no SNRs, a small SNR or multiple rosettes (Fig. 4). Such isolations will probably fail to\ngrow or transform into multi-lumen-containing organoids.\n We observed that the size and shape of SNRs varies substantially even within a\nsingle well. We most often isolate SNRs that are at least 200 μm in diameter with a\nclearly distinguishable single lumen without taking the shapes of the lumen and rosette\ninto consideration. Thus, isolated SNRs are of slightly different sizes (mean ± s.e.m. of\n297 ± 3 μm; 95% confidence interval: 290.6–303.3) and shapes. These factors could potentially\ninfluence the identities and distribution of cells in SNR-derived organoids. Recently, new\nmethods have been developed for generating uniform SNRs with a defined size and shape\nusing spatially confined micropatterned substrates69,70. We foresee that these innovations\ncan be adapted to enhance the efficiency of generating uniform SNR-derived organoids\nand to explore the effects of SNR size and shape on the properties and organization of cells\nin organoids.\n Another potential limitation is non-uniform lamination of organoid tissue. Although\nwe found regions in organoid sections with predictably organized neural cells, the\norganization was not uniform throughout the organoid. Instead, we observed regions\nwith unclear or no organization43. Those areas, however, were readily identifiable by visual\ninspection of a slice or section and were excluded from investigations involving imaging\nand electrophysiology experiments. The impact of disorganized areas on overall organoid\ndevelopment remains unclear.\n Other limitations are common to most organoid generation protocols34, including the\nabsence of vasculature to allow oxygen and nutrient delivery inside of the organoids, the lack of\nmicroglia to regulate the number of cells and synapses in organoids and the absence of neuronal\ninputs from the sensory organs and other brain regions to recapitulate information flow in\ncomplex brain networks. Recently, xenotransplantation of human organoids into the rodent\nbrain has been used to overcome some of these limitations79–82.\n\nExperimental design\nThe organoid generation protocol consists of five stages (Fig. 1): (1) PS cell maintenance and\npropagation, (2) neural induction, (3) NR formation and isolation, (4) organoid formation\nfrom isolated SNRs and (5) organoid maturation. The rationale for each stage is discussed\nin the preceding section. Here, we provide an overview of these five stages and additional\nconsiderations regarding the protocol and experimental procedures that we perform with\nSNR-derived organoids, including the generation of CRISPR–Cas9-engineered human stem\ncells with large genetic deletions (Box 1 and Fig. 6), scRNA-seq (Fig. 7), immunohistochemistry\n(Fig. 8) and slice patch-clamp electrophysiology (Fig. 9).\n\nStage 1: PS cell maintenance and propagation (Steps 1–21)\nThis section details the steps for thawing and passaging PS cells. It is essential to use validated\nand characterized human stem cell lines. Insufficiently characterized lines may lead to\nirreproducible results. We recommend following the standards for use of human stem cells\nin research recently released by the International Society for Stem Cell Research83. Wellcharacterized human stem cell lines produced from healthy control individuals and patients\nwith various genetic abnormalities are now available from multiple sources, including WiCell,\nAllen Institute for Cell Sciences, National Institute of Mental Health, Simons Foundation Autism\nResearch Initiative and California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. For disease modeling\nstudies, we recommend always including isogenic engineered lines as controls. The most\ncontrolled approach is to use conditional CRE- or FLP-mediated induction/rescue of genetic\nabnormality during differentiation84. This approach has successfully been used for studying\nautism spectrum disorder-, schizophrenia- and Alzheimer’s disease-associated genetic\nabnormalities85–87; however, it has not been used for studying large genetic abnormalities. In our\nprevious study43, we used a pair of guide RNAs to excise a complete copy of SHANK3 (~69.5 kB) in\nhuman PS cells (Box 1).",

Then, cells\nare replated at 1:1 ratio onto MG-coated plates (Fig. 2b). To initiate the induction, we change the\nstem cell medium to the induction medium on the next day after replating (Fig. 1). The duration\nof neural induction is line dependent, spanning 5–10 d. The variability in the duration of neural\ninduction could be due to the variable expression levels of BMP and TGF-β receptors in different\nhuman PS cell lines88. We stop neural induction and transition to the next step when we observe\ntissue thickening due to cell layering, as well as tissue curling and detachments (Fig. 2c), which\nare the hallmarks of successful acquisition of neuroectodermal fate. It is critical to assess daily\nthe progression of neural induction and remove floating dead cells during medium changes.\nWe normally do this by tilting the culture dish ~30° and aspirating 80–90% of old medium\ncontaining any floating cells.\n\nStage 3: NR formation and isolation (Steps 25–43)\nThe successfully induced cultures are replated using Dispase, which allows the detachment\nof neuroectodermal cell clusters. The clusters of neuroectodermal cells give rise to NRs.\nUpon replating, we switch to the amplification medium with EGF (10 ng/mL) and FGF2\n(10 ng/mL). Half the medium is exchanged every other day with fresh medium containing\n2× EGF (20 ng/mL) and 2× FGF2 (20 ng/mL) to maintain the final concentration at 10 ng/mL.\nWe limit FGF2 exposure to 5 d (two medium changes) to avoid potential tissue caudalization50.\nWe continue including EGF until NRs become apparent.
