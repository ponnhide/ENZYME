26 Aspirate CRS using vacuum and a sterile Pasteur pipette. After aspiration, place the conical tube
into the glass dish containing ice.
CRITICAL Remove the CRS as much as possible, as remaining CRS could decrease the cell
viability and compromise the integrity of the Matrigel matrix.
27 Calculate the volume needed for the desired splitting ratio allowing 50 μl of Matrigel per well
(i.e., 1.2 ml Matrigel per 24-well plate). A typical splitting ratio is 1:3 to 1:5, but this varies and
depends on the density of the original culture, length of culture since original thaw, and donor
intrinsic growth behavior.
28 Keep the tube on ice, and resuspend the organoid pellet in a maximum of 1 ml of Matrigel. If the
total volume required is <1 ml, add the required volume; for example, if 900 µl is needed to achieve
the desired splitting ratio, add 900 µl.
CRITICAL Initially, 1 ml is added since a larger volume makes it harder to dissociate the
organoids and leads to a more diverse organoid fragment size.
29 Bend a 1,000 µl pipette tip by pressing down the pipette tip on the inside of the cap for the conical
tube.
30 Once organoids have been fragmented, add the remaining Matrigel needed (calculated in Step 27)
to achieve the desired passaging ratio. Mix the Matrigel–organoid fragment suspension well before
proceeding to the next step.
