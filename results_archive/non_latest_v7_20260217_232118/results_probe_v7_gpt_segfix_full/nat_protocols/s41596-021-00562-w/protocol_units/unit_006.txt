18 Thaw an appropriate number of Matrigel aliquots in a 4 °C fridge (1.2 ml Matrigel is required for a full 24-well plate of organoids droplets). Thaw 1.2 ml additional Matrigel in case a higher split ratio will be used.
CRITICAL Matrigel needs to be thawed before Step 27. Thaw extra Matrigel ahead in case higher
splitting ratio is needed in Step 27.
19 Prepare colon organoid growth medium (15 ml for every 24-well plate) by ﬁrst making up base
medium, as described in Table 2, and then using this as a component of colon organoid growth
medium, made as described in Table 3. Alternatively, this medium can be prepared during CRS
incubation (Step 24).
20 Collect organoid droplets using the medium in which they are currently growing. Using a 1,000 µl
pipette, set the pipette to 650 µl (there should be a maximum volume in each well of 50 µl Matrigel
and 600 µl medium). Scrape the bottom of the well with the pipette tip to dislodge the M
...
22 Aspirate the supernatant (spent organoid growth medium) with vacuum using a sterile Pasteur
pipette.
23 Resuspend the Matrigel pellet in CRS using a 1:10 dilution. For a full 24-well plate of organoids, use
12 ml of CRS. Resuspend the Matrigel droplet by gently inverting the 15 ml conical tube.
CRITICAL Do not resuspend the droplet by repeated pipetting as organoid will adhere to the
serological pipette and there might be some organoid loss.
24 Incubate the resuspended Matrigel in the ice bucket for 45–60 min, or until Matrigel is dissolved.
Mix the Matrigel–CRS solution via gentle inversion every 10–15 min. Organoids will settle at the
bottom of the tube when Matrigel is fully dissolved.
CRITICAL Do not exceed 60 min of incubation as this can decrease cell viability. Do not vortex
the organoid suspension.
25 Centrifuge at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, there should be a noticeable organoid
pellet, ~200 µl volume of organoid, depending on the density of the original culture. During
centrifugation, prepare the material for the subsequent steps: sterilize a glass dish with PREempt
disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol. Add ice to 50–70% capacity of the glass dish, spray with 70%
ethanol again and place the dish into the biosafety cabinet. Put Matrigel aliquots into the aluminum
cooling block. Spray thoroughly with 70% ethanol, and place it into the glass dish containing
the ice.
CRITICAL Ice is not sterile; use with extra caution in the biosafety cabinet.
