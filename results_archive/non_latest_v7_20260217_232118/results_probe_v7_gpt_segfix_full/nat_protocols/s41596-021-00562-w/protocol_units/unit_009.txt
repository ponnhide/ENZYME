42 Prepare a coating solution containing 50 µg/ml collagen I in PBS−/−. For 12-well Transwells, add 300 µl of coating solution on the apical side and 1,200 µl on the basolateral side.
43 Incubate the Transwells at 37 °C for at least 2 h to allow collagen coating to occur.
44 Prepare colon monolayer seeding medium as described in Table 4. At least 2 ml should be made for each Transwell plus an additional 1–2 ml for cell counting. Alternatively, medium can be prepared during CRS incubation (Step 46).
45 Collect organoids as described in Steps 20–23.
