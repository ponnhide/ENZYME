31 Seed 50 µl droplets of the fragment suspension into each well of an Olympus 24-well, tissue culture
treated plate.
CRITICAL It is important to use Olympus 24-well, tissue culture treated plates as they maintain
spherical Matrigel droplets, which are critical for 3D organoid growth. Using Falcon tissue culture
treated plates results in the spreading and ﬂattening of the Matrigel droplet. Alternatively, Falcon
non-tissue culture treated plates may be used, but as these do not allow adhesion of the droplets,
there is a high risk of the Matrigel droplets dislodging from the well and being aspirated when
changing media.
32 Carefully transfer the plate(s) containing Matrigel droplets to the CO2 incubator. Incubate the
plates for 15–20 min to allow Matrigel gelation. After 15–20 min, check the Matrigel gelation by
tilting the plates. If the Matrigel holds ﬁrm, they should be ready.
33 Place the plate(s) in the biosafety cabinet. Add 600 µl of colon organoid medium to each well by
carefully loading into the side of the well to avoid disturbing the Matrigel droplet.
34 Incubate tissue culture plates in cell culture incubator at 37 °C, 95% air and 5% CO2 for 4 d (i.e., if
passaged on Monday, move to next step to change medium on Friday).
