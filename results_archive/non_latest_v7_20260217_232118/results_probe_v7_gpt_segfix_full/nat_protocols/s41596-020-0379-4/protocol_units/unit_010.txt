26 2–3 d after splitting, remove the medium, and add 500 µl of adDMEM/F12+++ medium into each well. Break up the BME drops using a P1000 ﬁlter tip, and transfer the material to an ice‑cold 15‑ml conical tube.

32 Add the required volume of cell‑freezing medium, and pipette up and down using a P1000 pipette to properly resuspend the organoids.

33 Per sterile cryogenic vial, add 500 µl of freezing medium with the resuspended organoids.

34 Place the cryogenic vial into a freezing container. Store the freezing container with the samples at –80 °C.

35 After storage at –80 °C for 24 h, remove the vials from the freezing container, and transfer them to the liquid nitrogen tank (approximately –180 °C).

36 Collect the cryogenic vial with the cryopreserved organoids from the liquid nitrogen tank on dry ice.

38 To thaw the freezing medium with the organoids, incubate the cryogenic vial for 1–3 min in a water bath at 37 °C.

39 Add 1 ml of adDMEM/F12+++ medium dropwise into the cryogenic vial while mixing, and then transfer the entire volume with the organoids in the vial to a 15‑ml conical tube. Fill the tube with adDMEM/F12+++ medium to a total volume of 10 ml.

40 Centrifuge the organoids at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C.

41 Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.

42 Follow Steps 22–25, as described above.
