1 Collect primary human tissue pieces, separated by biopsy site and/or tissue type (i.e., normal and tumor tissue) in 45 ml of ice-cold adDMEM/F12+++ medium in 50-ml conical tubes. (Optional) Add 10 µM ROCK inhibitor to adDMEM/F12+++ medium to increase cell survival. Keep tissue samples in this medium at 4 °C until the start of the isolation.

2 Assess whether obtained tissue pieces consist purely of epithelium or if they also contain fat or muscle tissue. If so, remove non-epithelial components as much as possible using surgical scissors or scalpels and forceps under a dissection microscope. If not, continue to the next step immediately.
