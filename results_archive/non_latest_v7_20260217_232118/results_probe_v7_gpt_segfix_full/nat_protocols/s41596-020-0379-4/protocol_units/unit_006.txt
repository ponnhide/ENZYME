10 Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in BME or Matrigel. BME should be kept on ice to prevent it from solidifying; thus, work quickly. The amount of BME depends on the size of the pellet. Approximately 10,000 cells should be plated in 40 µl of BME.

11 Plate the BME containing organoids on the bottom of pre‑heated 24‑well suspension cell culture plates in drops of ~10 µl each. Place three to four drops into each well.

13 Prepare the required amount of organoid medium (tissue‑speciﬁc growth factors are listed in Supplementary Table 1), add 10 µM ROCK inhibitor and Primocin (100 µg/ml) and place medium in the 37 °C water bath. For head and neck organoids, additionally add 0.5 µg/ml caspofungin to the human head and neck organoid medium (see Reagent setup).
