39. Collect Dlxi1/2b::GFP+ and Dlxi1/2b::GFP− populations through FACS. Use cells dissociated from control hSO as a negative control to set up the gate for FACS. Conduct FACS at 4 °C and collect cells in a low‑binding 15‑ml conical tube containing 5 ml of NM supplemented with 10% FBS (vol/vol) and 20 μM Y‑27632.
40. It is critical to collect a sufficient number of cells. Test the number/percentage of Dlxi1/2b::GFP+ cells that you can get through FACS from a certain number of organoids to decide on the number of organoids that will be used for the experiment.
