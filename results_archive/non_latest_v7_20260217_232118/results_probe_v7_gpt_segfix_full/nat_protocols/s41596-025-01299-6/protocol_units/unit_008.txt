30. Pool 12 organoids into one well of a six-well plate along with 3 ml of enzyme solution with papain (10 U ml−1). Incubate the plate with organoids at 37 °C for 15 min in a 5% CO2 incubator. Gently shake the plate horizontally every 5 min to evenly distribute the papain solution.
31. After digestion, transfer the sample and enzyme solution to a 15‑ml conical tube.
32. Centrifuge the 15‑ml conical tube for 30 s at 200g. After centrifugation, remove the supernatant and add 1 ml of low‑ovo solution. Centrifuge the 15‑ml conical tube for 30 s at 200g. Wash one more time with 1 ml of low‑ovo solution and then add 1 ml of low‑ovo solution to the sample.
33. Mechanically dissociate the organoids by sequentially pipetting a few times with a P1000 tip. After pipetting, no large chunks of cells should be visible. Transfer ~800 μl of the supernatant to a new 15‑ml conical tube.
34. Pipette the remaining cell chunks a few times with a P200 tip and transfer ~180 μl of the supernatant to the same conical tube. Finally, pipette a few times with a P20 tip to break the leftover debris and transfer the remaining supernatant to the same conical tube.
