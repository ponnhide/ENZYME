55. Seed ~25,000–30,000 iNPCs into one well of a 96-well U‑bottom low‑attachment plate in 100 µl of hNPSR‑v2 medium and then centrifuge the plate at 300g for 5 min.
56. After centrifugation, place the plate in the incubator to allow the cells to aggregate overnight.
57. Day 0. The iNPC aggregates are transferred to the membrane of a Transwell for air–liquid interface culture. First, in a six-well Transwell plate, add 1 ml of phase I medium (Table 7) to the bottom chamber of each well.
58. To transfer the aggregates without compromising their spherical structure, cut the tip of a P200 pipette tip to carefully pick up and place the iNPC aggregates on the Transwell membrane.
59. Use a new uncut P200 pipette tip to carefully pipette out the surrounding medium that lingered from the transfer so that the aggregates can attach to the membrane.
