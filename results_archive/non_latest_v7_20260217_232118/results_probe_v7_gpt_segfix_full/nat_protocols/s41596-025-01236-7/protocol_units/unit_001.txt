7. In a new 1.7-ml Eppendorf tube, prepare 1 ml of mTeSR Plus for one well of a 12-well plate. Seed the cells at a 1:12 ratio to the newly prepared mTeSR.
8. Aspirate the Matrigel-coating medium from the well and add your passaged cells in mTeSR Plus to the well. Return to the incubator.
9. Days 2–5. Starting on day 2 (where day 0 is the day of cell seeding in Step 8), change the medium every other day with fresh mTeSR Plus medium (no medium change is needed on day 1). Healthy hPSCs will reach a confluency of 80–90% 4–5 d after passage.
