13 Use a 10-mL serological pipette to gently resuspend the aggregates (3 mL per well) in N2B27 medium + 12 µM CHIR99021 + 30 ng/mL BMP-4 and transfer the aggregates back to the low-attachment plate. Incubate the cells.
14 Use a P1000 pipette to quickly resuspend the aggregates once per day to avoid excessive fusion of aggregates. Incubate for 3 d to induce mesodermal differentiation.
