15 On day 3, transfer the aggregates to a 15-mL tube and wait for them to settle down by gravitation. Do not discard the 6-well plate; save it for later aggregate replating.
16 After cell aggregates have collected at the bottom of the 15-mL Falcon tube, carefully aspirate the medium.
17 Resuspend the aggregates (3 mL per well) in N2B27 medium + 100 ng/mL VEGF-A + 2 µM forskolin and transfer the aggregates back to the low-attachment plates. Incubate for 2 more days (Fig. 2c).
