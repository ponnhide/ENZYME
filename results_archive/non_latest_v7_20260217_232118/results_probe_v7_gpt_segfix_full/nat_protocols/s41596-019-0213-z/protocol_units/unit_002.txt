4 Resuspend the cells in 5 mL of aggregation medium using a 5-mL serological pipette and collect the cells in a 15-mL Falcon tube.
5 For cell counting, mix 10 μL of cell suspension and 10 μL of 0.1% Trypan blue solution (included with the counting chamber slides) and pipette 10 μL of the mixture onto a counting chamber slide. Mix the cell suspension thoroughly before taking the counting aliquot to achieve accurate and consistent cell number measurements.
6 Count viable cells using an automated cell counter or under a microscope.
7 Calculate the cell suspension volume needed for the experiment (2 × 105 cells per well).
