Procedure
 1 Seed PSCs onto a Matrigel-coated 24-well plate.
 2 The next day, transfect with 2 µg of the vector plasmid into the PSCs by using Lipofectamine 3000 (following
 the manufacturer’s instructions).
 3 After 24 h of transfection, coat a 96-well plate with Matrigel GFR. Add mTeSR supplemented with 10 µM Y-
 27632 into each well. Sort the GFP-expressing single cells into the prepared 96-well plate by ﬂow cytometer.
 4 After 2 d of sorting, change the medium to mTeSR without Y-27632.
 5 Repeat daily medium changes until a colony is observed.
 6 Passage and collect the colony. Isolate genomic DNA from part of the collected colony by using a blood and
 cell culture DNA mini kit (following the manufacturer’s instructions) and store the remaining cells.
 7 Conﬁrm the sequence of the target region of the gRNA.
 8 Expand the resulting clones for the organoid experiment.

 of primitive tissues segregates in the HBPOs after 30 d of culture (Fig. 4d–f). In conclusion, this
 HBPO system allows a detailed study of the early morphogenesis of HBP subdomains, and the
 generation of inter-connected, multi-organ structures in vitro from healthy and diseased PSC lines
 that can be reversibly manipulated by emerging technology such as genome editing (Box 2).
