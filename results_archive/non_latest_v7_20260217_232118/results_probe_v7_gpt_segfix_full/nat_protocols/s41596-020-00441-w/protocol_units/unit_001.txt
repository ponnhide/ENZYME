 Human organoids are emerging as a valuable resource to investigate human organ development and disease. The
 applicability of human organoids has been limited, partly due to the oversimpliﬁed architecture of the current technology,
 which generates single-tissue organoids that lack inter-organ structural connections. Thus, engineering organoid systems
 that incorporate connectivity between neighboring organs is a critical unmet challenge in an evolving organoid ﬁeld. Here,
 we describe a protocol for the continuous patterning of hepatic, biliary and pancreatic (HBP) structures from a 3D culture
 of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). After differentiating PSCs into anterior and posterior gut spheroids, the two
 spheroids are fused together in one well. Subsequently, self-patterning of multi-organ (i.e., HBP) domains occurs within
 the boundary region of the two spheroids, even in the absence of any extrinsic factors. Long-term culture of HBP
 structures induces differentiation of the domains into segregated organs complete with developmentally relevant

 unique platform for studying human development, congenital disorders, drug development and therapeutic transplanta-
 tion. More broadly, our approach could potentially be used to establish inter-organ connectivity models for other organ
 systems derived from stem cell cultures.

 Introduction
 Failure to establish contiguous organ architectures because of developmental defects, infection or
 drug toxicity leads to critical and, in most cases, lethal organ failures, as seen in biliary atresia,
 tracheoesophageal ﬁstula and congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract. Animal models
 have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms for generating connections between tissues.
 However, because of profound differences in both metabolism and molecular regulation between
 animals and humans, translation of these ﬁndings from animal models into human biology and
 disease remains a major challenge1.
 Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids are increasingly recognized as cutting-
 edge in vitro model systems for investigating human organ development and diseases, with the
 potential to also supplant fetal tissue research2–8. However, the applicability of hPSC-derived orga-
 noids has been limited thus far, partly because technology has been limited to the generation of
 single-tissue organoids lacking inter-organ structural connections. It is vital to understand the
 mechanisms that drive the intricate inter-organ orchestrations that occur during organogenesis,
 which can then be leveraged for developing appropriate multi-organ 3-D stem cell culture systems
 that allow for seamless connections to neighboring tissues9–11.
 Here, we describe a 3D differentiation approach using hPSCs to grow gut spheroids with distinct
 regional identities, which are comprised of both endoderm and mesoderm populations. We
 demonstrate that the anterior and posterior spheroid interactions recapitulate the in vivo foregut and
 midgut boundary. These interactions generate an organoid composed of several types of organs,
 called a human hepato-biliary-pancreatic (HBP) organoid (HBPO)12, that can model the inter-
 coordinated speciﬁcation and invagination that naturally occur in development. Although this system
 has limitations, such as requiring further reﬁnement of the later stages of HBP organogenesis

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 (increased tissue maturation would be required for transplant applications), this HBPO system
 enables modeling of complex multi-organ development and disease in vitro.

 Development of the protocol
 In early embryogenesis, the foregut endoderm ﬁrst arises at the early- to mid-primitive streak stages,
 leading to the formation of the deﬁnitive endoderm. This endodermal sheet begins to fold in at the
 anterior and posterior ends, forming the anterior and caudal intestinal portals, respectively, during
 early somitogenesis13. During anterior intestinal portal formation and subsequent foregut tubulo-
 genesis, a medial part of the foregut endoderm sheet is roughly deﬁned in the dorsal walls of the
 primitive gut tubes, and the lateral foregut endoderm cells are relocated into the ventral midline of the
 gut tube closure14. During foregut closure, the liver, gallbladder, and ventral pancreas primordia are
 speciﬁed within adjacent regions of the ventral foregut endoderm.
 The formation of each individual primordium is induced and maintained by distinct signaling
 factors released from neighboring tissues15,16. In the posterior foregut, mesodermal cues instigate
 localized proliferation and/or migration of the endoderm, which results in budding of the liver, and
 dorsal and ventral pancreas by embryonic day 9.5. After embryonic day 9.5, the speciﬁed endodermal
 organ domains of the gut tube undergo morphogenesis and lineage diversiﬁcation to create the
 functional architecture connecting neighboring organs.
 Well-deﬁned temporal expression of certain genes has been localized to distinct regions during
 organogenesis, and this gene expression can be exploited to identify particular areas of the embryo. In
 vivo, the HBP anlage, which is demarcated by HHEX (hematopoietically-expressed homeobox pro-
 tein) and PDX1 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1) expression17, is ﬁrst speciﬁed at the boundary
 region between the foregut and midgut, as indicated by expression of the foregut endoderm marker
 SOX2 (SRY-box2) and the mid/hindgut endoderm marker CDX2 (caudal-type homeobox2),
 respectively. The HBP anlage forms an epithelial vesicle invaginating ventrally from the primitive gut
 as a result of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions18,19. Given that genetic perturbation of such
 boundary-deﬁning genes disrupts integral multi-organ development20, it is clear that continuous,
 dynamic organogenesis occurs in a complex environment and is probably driven by neighboring
 factors (such as boundary interactions)21. From this knowledge, we hypothesized that the recapitu-
 lation of the foregut-midgut boundary in a stem cell culture acts to induce continuous hepatic, biliary
 and pancreatic structures.
 Therefore, to develop a foregut-midgut boundary, we ﬁrst exposed deﬁnitive endoderm, patterned
 as previously described4, to ﬁbroblast growth factor and a WNT signaling agonist, which promote gut
 tube formation and patterning, in the presence or absence of a bone morphogenetic protein
 antagonist, which induces foregut speciﬁcation, to direct SOX2 expressing anterior or CDX2
 expressing posterior gut fate.

 Overview of the procedure
 The overall procedure can be separated into six major stages (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Video 1).
 Stage 1 is PSC culture (Steps 1–19; day −2 to day −1). Stage 2 is deﬁnitive endoderm induction (Steps
 20–29; day 0–day 2). Stage 3 is anterior/posterior gut patterning (Steps 30–33; day 3–day 6) and
 anterior/posterior gut spheroid formation (Steps 34–37; day 7). Stage 4 is anterior-posterior boundary
 formation (Steps 38–41; day 8). Stage 5 is HBPO polarization culture (Steps 42–48; day 9–day 12).
 Stage 6 is long-term HBPO growth culture (Steps 49–55; day 13 onward).

 Applications
 Studying mechanisms by which inter-tissue connections are generated in humans remains a major
 challenge because of limited access to fetal samples and poor manipulability22. Although signaling
 mechanisms for organ speciﬁcation have been studied in animal models, the ways in which com-
 binatorial endoderm-mesoderm interactions orchestrate inter-connected and multi-organ patterning
 in humans remain elusive. Human HBPOs can serve as an in-a-dish model to investigate and
 interrogate the complex inter-organ segregation process. For example, we have shown that the
 transient and localized suppression of retinoic acid signaling at the foregut-midgut border is crucial
 for directing HBP patterning in hPSC-derived organoids12. Interestingly, in agreement with animal
 studies, the accompanying mesenchyme probably plays an important role in lineage speciﬁcation into
 HBP precursors. Therefore, this system provides a novel platform that will facilitate future
 mechanistic studies about contributions of different cell types in organogenesis. Our integrated

 multi-organ model system can be used as a tractable, manipulatable and readily achievable model to
 broaden our knowledge of complex organogenesis and disease mechanisms in humans.
 For example, our HBPOs could be useful for mechanistic studies of biliary atresia and evaluation
 of therapeutic responses to new potential treatments. Biliary atresia, a disease of inter-organ con-
 nectivity failure, is the most common indication for pediatric liver transplantation worldwide.
 Persistent inﬂammation and obstruction in the bile ducts lead to abnormal accumulation of bile and
 consequently signiﬁcant liver damage. Several animal model studies of experimental biliary atresia
 have investigated the role of a Notch effector, Hes family bHLH transcription factor 1 (HES1), in the
 initiation and progression of the disease. Deﬁcient Hes1 expression results in induction of experi-
 mental biliary atresia in animals23, with ectopic pancreatic endocrine cell generation probably due to
 the role of HES1 as a general negative regulator of endodermal endocrine differentiation23. We know
 that HES1 expression is evolutionariy conserved in gallbladder primordium and its derivatives in
 humans, but it remains unclear how HES1 activity is involved in the segregation of the HBP pri-
 mordium and subsequent development of the bile duct system. In HBPOs differentiated from PSCs
 with a genetic knock-out of HES1, biliary speciﬁcation is abolished, while pancreatic fate commitment
 is promoted in Hes1-deﬁcient mice12.
 Building inter-organ connections in a dish has been a long-standing challenge because of a limited
 understanding of the developmental processes during organogenesis. Previous studies have also been
 hindered by lack of efﬁcient programming of the cells to naturally segregate and organize in a
 spatiotemporally appropriate manner. Many attempts have been made to either developmentally or
 synthetically solve these issues, including organoid generation, tissue printing, cell-material composite
 formation and decellularization and recellularization of existing 3D tissue. Each of these methods has
 shown some success; however, none has provided a durable, persistently functional system1.

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 Recapitulating boundary interactions in 3D stem cell culture is one potential approach to drive an
 organ segregation program10,24–27. Animal organogenesis studies have revealed that the prospective
 HBP region arises from a boundary between the foregut and midgut. Co-cultivation of stem
 cell–derived foregut and midgut is sufﬁcient to induce a boundary-speciﬁc transcriptional program
 that includes the modulation of WNT and retinoic acid pathways, leading to HBPO generation. Thus,
 in vitro boundary modeling could potentially be used to establish inter-organ connectivity models for
 other organ systems derived from stem cell cultures.

 Experimental design
 Differentiation is achieved through several steps, starting with the 2D generation of anterior and
 posterior gut cells according to previously described methods4,28 with certain key modiﬁcations in
 basal medium and concentration of growth factors. Next, from these 2D cultures, we make single-cell
 suspensions of the anterior and posterior gut cells, and, in the presence of the Rho kinase inhibitor
 Y-27632, spheroids are generated on day 7. The successful generation of stable spheroids is absolutely
 critical to efﬁciently and consistently form HBPOs. Therefore, the size of the aggregates is crucial, and
 careful consideration must be given to both the number of cells used and the incubation time for
 aggregate formation. To generate a boundary organoid, one anterior and one posterior spheroid are
 carefully mixed in Matrigel in a single well, wherein the two spheroids will fuse overnight (Fig. 1).
 For long-term culture, we tested several different culture conditions for the day 13 boundary
 organoids to evaluate HBP organogenesis12. Among the tested culture conditions, we found that
 using the air–liquid interface system of excised PROX1+ domains continued the morphogenesis for
 the longest period, resulting in the formation of a branching structure that we have called HBPO.
 Time-course imaging showed that the dissected PROX1+ domain changed from an epithelial
 morphology to a more convoluted structure after 2 d of culture.

 Alternative methods
 Recently, several groups have described hepato-biliary-like organoids that can be differentiated from
 hPSCs and fetal liver progenitor cells29,30. However, these methods generate liver tissues composed of
 intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes, and do not generate any extrahepatic components
 or surrounding organs. Tissue decellularization and recellularization methods have shown some
 success in creating more spatially deﬁned 3D tissues, but the temporal dynamics that naturally occur
 between organs during biological or pathological processes have not yet been modelled31,32. Our
 system is potentially compatible with emerging organ-on-chip technologies, provided a measurable
 readout can be developed33.

 Limitations
 The early stage of our protocol (up to day 13) can be carried out with high efﬁciency and repro-
 ducibility. However, moving into later stages, morphological variation is observed between experi-
 ments because of variation in the efﬁciency of branching of the pancreas-like tissue. Therefore, the
 dissection of the HBPO region by using a lineage-speciﬁc reporter PSC line is recommended to
 improve the efﬁciency of epithelial bifurcation.
 Our current HBPO system is less mature than adult tissues, and it is not suitable for transplan-
 tation applications. Further HBP organogenesis (e.g., to include the liver budding process, including
 delamination of the hepatic epithelial sheet by disruption of the laminar layer) would potentially
 require the addition of stromal cell components, such as septum transversum mesenchyme and/or
 endothelial progenitors. Nevertheless, the in vitro contiguous speciﬁcation and early morphogenesis
 of HBP subdomains provide an opportunity to investigate the complex interactions at the
 anterior–posterior boundary and the generation of interconnected, multi-organ structures. This
 model can be used to study personalized human organogenesis and model disease systems in vitro,
 with the ultimate goal of developing new therapies for human diseases.
