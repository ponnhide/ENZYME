TROUBLESHOOTING\n7 Calculate the cell suspension volume needed for the experiment (2 × 105 cells per well).\nCRITICAL STEP The cell number required for aggregate formation varies by hPSC line.

Cover the lid with the 10-cm plate bottom and proceed to a horizontal laminar\nflow station equipped with a stereomicroscope.\n(iii) Use two sterile 30-gauge needles to cut out single blood vessel networks and try to reduce\nthe amount of excessive matrix surrounding the organoids (as shown in Supplementary\nVideo 1). Depending on initial seeding densities, you should expect a full 96-well plate of\norganoids from 2 to 3 wells of a 12-well plate.\n(iv) Transfer single organoids (using a cut P1000 tip) to a 6-well low-attachment plate and add\n5 mL of StemPro-34 SFM complete medium including 15% FBS, 100 ng/mL VEGF-A and\n100 ng/mL FGF-2 and incubate the organoids.\n(v) One day after separating the blood vessel networks (d11), use a cut P1000 tip to transfer\nsingle organoids to low-attachment round-bottom 96-well ultra-low-attachment plates.\nAdd fresh StemPro-34 SFM complete medium including 15% FBS, 100 ng/mL VEGF-A\nand 100 ng/mL FGF-2. Around 4 d later (d15), blood vessel organoids should show a\nround and fully encapsulated morphology (Fig. 2k–m).\nCRITICAL STEP Prolonged culture of multiple blood vessel organoids together in one\nwell will lead to fusion of organoids.
