All codes are available upon request.\n\n Data analysis See Methods. All codes are available upon request.\nFor manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the research but not yet described in published literature, software must be made available to editors/reviewers.\nWe strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). See the Nature Research guidelines for submitting code & software for further information.\n\n\nData\nPolicy information about availability of data\n All manuscripts must include a data availability statement. This statement should provide the following information, where applicable:\n - Accession codes, unique identifiers, or web links for publicly available datasets\n - A list of figures that have associated raw data\n - A description of any restrictions on data availability\n\nAll data are deposited to EMBL-EBI ArrayExpress. The single-cell RNA-seq data based on 10X Genomics is deposited with the accession number E-MTAB-7552. The\nsingle-cell RNA-seq data based on Fluidigm C1/Smart-Seq2 is deposited with the accession number E-MTAB-8234. The single-cell ATAC-seq data is deposited with\n October 2018\n\n\nthe accession numbers E-MTAB-8089 (human), E-MTAB-8043 (chimp), E-MTAB-8083 (bonobo), and E-MTAB-8087 (macaque). The bulk ATAC-seq data is deposited\nwith the accession number E-MTAB-8228. The single-nucleus RNA-seq data of the adult brain samples is deposited with the accession number E-MTAB-8230.

If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before making your selection.\n Life sciences Behavioural & social sciences Ecological, evolutionary & environmental sciences\nFor a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdf\n\n\nLife sciences study design\nAll studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.\n Sample size Samples are listed in Supplementary Table 1.\n For determining the number of lines in DE analysis between human, chimp and macaque, see Extended Figure 8. For determining the number\n of cells to be sequenced per organoid and species, our project is the most extensive analysis thus far; based on Camp et al. (PNAS, 2015),\n Quadrato et al. (Nature, 2017) and Pollen et al. (Cell, 2019), we believe that we sufficiently sample the heterogeneity with the number of cells\n sequenced.\n\n Data exclusions We excluded low quality cells using criteria as described in the Methods. Besides that, no data were excluded.\n\n Replication We analyzed multiple organoids from multiple cell lines to determine the reproducibility of gene expression patterns across organoids and cell\n lines. We analyzed multiple organoids for different time points. We analyzed multiple individuals per species for the adult brain data.\n\n Randomization We try to mitigate any batch effects by analyzing organoids from multiple batches for a given line. In a set of experiments, we also multiplexed\n different cell lines from different species or different human individuals. We pooled tissue material from multiple individuals from different\n species for the adult brain data to reduce batch effects.\n\n Blinding Investigators were not blinded during data acquisition.\n\n\nReporting for specific materials, systems and methods\nWe require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies. Here, indicate whether each material,\nsystem or method listed is relevant to your study. If you are not sure if a list item applies to your research, read the appropriate section before selecting a response.\n\nMaterials & experimental systems Methods\nn/a Involved in the study n/a Involved in the study\n Antibodies ChIP-seq\n Eukaryotic cell lines Flow cytometry\n Palaeontology MRI-based neuroimaging\n Animals and other organisms\n Human research participants\n Clinical data\n\n\nAntibodies\n Antibodies used See Methods, in the section \"Immunohistochemistry\".\n\n Validation See Methods, validations as provided by the manufacturer.\n\n\nEukaryotic cell lines\nPolicy information about cell lines\n Cell line source(s) See Methods, in the section \"Pluripotent stem cell lines and organoid culture\".\n October 2018\n\n\n Authentication See Methods, in the section \"Pluripotent stem cell lines and organoid culture\".
