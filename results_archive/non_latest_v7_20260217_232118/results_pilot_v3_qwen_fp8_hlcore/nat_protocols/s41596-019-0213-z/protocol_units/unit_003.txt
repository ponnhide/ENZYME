Procedure
 Generation and differentiation of hPSC aggregates ● Timing ~6 d
 CRITICAL We cultivate hPSCs under feeder-free conditions using E8 medium and on growth
 c


 factor–reduced Matrigel-coated 6-well plates. Routinely, we passage the cells every 4–5 d using EDTA, as
 previously described38.
 CRITICAL Proper maintenance of hPSCs is critical to efﬁcient vascular differentiation. Seeding
 c


 density and colony size must be closely monitored, and spontaneous background differentiation must be
 kept as low as possible (Fig. 2a).
 1 Wash hPSCs with 0.5 mM EDTA by removing E8 medium and replacing it with 0.6 mL of 0.5 mM
 EDTA per well of a 6-well plate.
 2 Aspirate the EDTA solution, add 0.6 mL of Accutase per well and incubate for 3–5 min at 37 °C.
 Closely monitor cells under the tissue culture microscope until the cells start to round up.
 3 Dissociate the cells from the plate with a P1000 pipette and pipette the cells gently up and down
 (2–3×) to break up aggregates and to generate single cells.
 CRITICAL STEP Do not pipette the cells more than 2–3×, because single hPSCs are sensitive to
 c


 mechanical stress.
 4 Resuspend the cells in 5 mL of aggregation medium using a 5-mL serological pipette and collect the
 cells in a 15-mL Falcon tube.
 5 For cell counting, mix 10 μL of cell suspension and 10 μL of 0.1% Trypan blue solution (included
 with the counting chamber slides) and pipette 10 μL of the mixture onto a counting chamber slide.
 Mix the cell suspension thoroughly before taking the counting aliquot to achieve accurate and
 consistent cell number measurements.
 6 Count viable cells using an automated cell counter or under a microscope.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 7 Calculate the cell suspension volume needed for the experiment (2 × 105 cells per well).
 CRITICAL STEP The cell number required for aggregate formation varies by hPSC line. For cell
 c


 lines that are poor at forming aggregates, the cell number must be adjusted to between 5 × 105 and
 1 × 106 cells per well.
 8 Centrifuge the cells at 300g for 5 min (22–23 °C) and aspirate the medium.
 9 Resuspend the cells in fresh aggregation medium (3 mL per well) containing 50 μM Y-27632.

 10 Place 3 mL of cell suspension per well into a 6-well low-attachment plate and incubate for 1 d until
 cell aggregates with smooth borders (>50- to 100-µm diameter) have been formed (Fig. 2b).
 CRITICAL STEP Efﬁcient aggregate formation is absolutely essential for the success of the


 c
 protocol. Aggregation capacity varies between hPSC lines, and thus the incubation time may need
 to be adjusted from 1 d to 2 or even 3 d.
 11 One day after aggregates have formed (d0), transfer the aggregates to a 15-mL Falcon tube with a
 10-mL serological pipette and wait for the aggregates to settle down by gravitation. Do not discard
 the 6-well plate; save it for later aggregate replating.
 CRITICAL STEP Gentle treatment of aggregates is important. Always collect aggregates by

 c
 gravitation. Centrifugation of cell aggregates is not recommended at any point in the protocol.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 12 After cell aggregates have collected at the bottom of the 15-mL Falcon tube (this may take
 15–20 min), carefully aspirate the medium.
 13 Use a 10-mL serological pipette to gently resuspend the aggregates (3 mL per well) in N2B27
 medium + 12 µM CHIR99021 + 30 ng/mL BMP-4 and transfer the aggregates back to the
 low-attachment plate. Incubate the cells.
 14 Use a P1000 pipette to quickly resuspend the aggregates once per day to avoid excessive fusion of
 aggregates. Incubate for 3 d to induce mesodermal differentiation.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 15 On day 3, transfer the aggregates to a 15-mL tube and wait for them to settle down by gravitation.
 Do not discard the 6-well plate; save it for later aggregate replating.
 16 After cell aggregates have collected at the bottom of the 15-mL Falcon tube, carefully aspirate the
 medium.
 17 Resuspend the aggregates (3 mL per well) in N2B27 medium + 100 ng/mL VEGF-A + 2 µM
 forskolin and transfer the aggregates back to the low-attachment plates. Incubate for 2 more
 days (Fig. 2c).


 Generation of blood vessel networks and organoids ● Timing ~9 d
 18 Calculate the number of wells of a 12-well plate needed for aggregate embedding. We embed one
 full 6-well plate of aggregates in one entire 12-well plate. This usually corresponds to 40–60
 aggregates per well.
 CRITICAL STEP The density of aggregates per well is important. Too dense seeding will lead to
 c


 excessive fusion of blood vessel networks, which makes the analysis and proceeding further with the
 protocol difﬁcult. By contrast, too sparse seeding will result in inefﬁcient vascular network
 formation.
 19 Calculate the total amount of collagen I–Matrigel solution needed. We use 1 mL per well (in total;
 0.5 mL per well for layer 1 + 0.5 mL per well for layer 2, e.g., one entire 12-well plate will require
 12 mL of collagen I–Matrigel solution: 6 mL for layer 1 (4.5 mL of collagen I solution + 1.5 mL of
 Matrigel) + 6 mL (4.5 mL of collagen I solution + 1.5 mL of Matrigel) for layer 2).
 20 Thaw the required Matrigel aliquots on ice.
 21 Pipette the collagen I solution as described above. Carefully mix by pipetting up and down after
 adding PureCol.
 22 Pipette the exact amount of collagen I solution into a fresh 15-mL Falcon tube and place it on ice.
 23 Add Matrigel to collagen I solution and mix thoroughly by carefully pipetting up and down.
 24 Add 0.5 mL of collagen I/Matrigel solution per 12-well plate and swirl the plate equally to distribute
 the solution in the wells.
 25 Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 2 h for solidiﬁcation.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 26 Pipette the aggregates into 15-mL tubes with a 10-mL serological pipette. Collect aggregates by
 gravitation.
 27 Wash the aggregates by aspirating the supernatant and adding 1 mL of StemPro-34 SFM complete
 medium. Repeat the wash once.
 28 Use a P200 pipette to aspirate the medium; remove all remaining medium carefully.
 29 For the second layer, add PureCol to prepare complete collagen I solution.
 30 Prepare the collagen I–Matrigel solution and keep on ice.
 31 Resuspend the aggregates in collagen I–Matrigel solution and keep on ice.

 32 Remove the 12-well plate containing the ﬁrst layer of collagen I–Matrigel from the incubator
 and carefully add 0.5 mL of cell aggregate–collagen I–Matrigel solution to each well of the
 12-well plate.
 33 Distribute the aggregates in the wells by rocking the plate back and forth. Once the aggregates are
 well distributed, slowly move the plate to the incubator.
 CRITICAL STEP The aggregates should be well distributed within the wells to avoid fusion of


 c
 aggregates.
 CRITICAL STEP Once the collagen I–Matrigel solution is at room temperature, the polymeriza-


 c
 tion process will start. Do not rock the plate for longer than 30 s–1 min to avoid disturbing the
 solidiﬁcation process.
 34 Incubate the 12-well plate for 2 h at 37 °C for gel solidiﬁcation.
 35 Add prewarmed (37 °C) StemPro-34 SFM complete medium including 15% FBS, 100 ng/mL
 VEGF-A and 100 ng/mL FGF-2 to induce blood vessel differentiation. Sprouting vessels should
 appear after 1–3 d after embedding.
 CRITICAL STEP The medium must be properly prewarmed to ensure matrix integrity after
 c


 addition of medium.

 36 Change the medium after 3 d and then every other day.
 37 On d10, proceed to the next step to analyze blood vessel networks (using the staining protocol)
 and/or to grow and ﬁx vascular organoid cultures.

 Staining protocols for vascular networks and growth of and staining of blood vessel
 organoids ● Timing 2–3 d
 38 Fix vascular networks (option A) or grow and ﬁx vascular organoids (option B).
 (A) Preparation of vascular networks
 CRITICAL Between 40 and 60 vascular networks can be analyzed from one 12-well culture
 c


 without any expected loss of material during the preparation procedure.
 (i) Carefully aspirate the medium from a well using a P1000 pipette and add 4%
 paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in PBS for 20 min at room temperature.
 CRITICAL STEP PFA fumes will affect cell viability in neighboring wells. If not all the
 c


 wells of the 12-well plate are intended for ﬁxation, use a spatula to carefully lift selected gels
 and use a spoon to transfer the matrix to another 12-well plate for ﬁxation.
 (ii) Remove the PFA solution and add PBS.
 PAUSE POINT Fixed blood vessel networks can be kept in PBS in the refrigerator for up
 j


 to 1 month. Seal the plate with Paraﬁlm to avoid liquid evaporation.
 (iii) To proceed with staining, cut the gels into smaller pieces (1/4–1/2 of a 12-well gel) under a
 stereomicroscope using extra-ﬁne scissors and ﬁne forceps. Avoid cutting through vascular
 networks.
 (iv) Use forceps to transfer the gel fragments to a fresh 2-mL Eppendorf tube.
 (B) Establishment of blood vessel organoids and preparation for staining
 (i) For blood vessel organoid cultures, liberate the entire matrix from the well bottom, using
 the round end of a sterile spatula. Move the spatula toward the well center along the
 bottom of the well until the gel is freely ﬂoating.
 (ii) Under sterile conditions, transfer the gel with a sterile lab spoon to the lid of a 10-cm dish
 (Fig. 2j). Cover the lid with the 10-cm plate bottom and proceed to a horizontal laminar
 ﬂow station equipped with a stereomicroscope.
 (iii) Use two sterile 30-gauge needles to cut out single blood vessel networks and try to reduce
 the amount of excessive matrix surrounding the organoids (as shown in Supplementary
 Video 1). Depending on initial seeding densities, you should expect a full 96-well plate of
 organoids from 2 to 3 wells of a 12-well plate.
 (iv) Transfer single organoids (using a cut P1000 tip) to a 6-well low-attachment plate and add
 5 mL of StemPro-34 SFM complete medium including 15% FBS, 100 ng/mL VEGF-A and
 100 ng/mL FGF-2 and incubate the organoids.
 (v) One day after separating the blood vessel networks (d11), use a cut P1000 tip to transfer
 single organoids to low-attachment round-bottom 96-well ultra-low-attachment plates.
 Add fresh StemPro-34 SFM complete medium including 15% FBS, 100 ng/mL VEGF-A
