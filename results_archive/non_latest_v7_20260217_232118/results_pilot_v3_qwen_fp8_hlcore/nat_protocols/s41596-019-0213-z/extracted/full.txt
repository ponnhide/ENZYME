 Blood vessels are fundamental to animal life and have critical roles in many diseases, such as stroke, myocardial infarction
 and diabetes. The vasculature is formed by endothelial cells that line the vessel and are covered with mural cells,
 speciﬁcally pericytes in smaller vessels and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) in larger-diameter vessels. Both
 endothelial cells and mural cells are essential for proper blood vessel function and can be derived from human pluripotent
 stem cells (hPSCs). Here, we describe a protocol to generate self-organizing 3D human blood vessel organoids from
 hPSCs that exhibit morphological, functional and molecular features of human microvasculature. These organoids are
 differentiated via mesoderm induction of hPSC aggregates and subsequent differentiation into endothelial networks and
 pericytes in a 3D collagen I–Matrigel matrix. Blood vessels form within 2–3 weeks and can be further grown in scalable
 suspension culture. Importantly, in vitro–differentiated human blood vessel organoids transplanted into immunocompro-

 Introduction
 The vasculature is one of the ﬁrst organs to develop during embryogenesis and is fundamental to the
 function of all other organs. In the adult, blood vessel dysfunction is linked to major diseases such as
 stroke, heart attack, diabetes or cancer1. Blood vessels are composed of endothelial cells, which
 provide the inner lining and form the luminal tubes, and mural cells such as pericytes or vSMCs,
 which cover the outer endothelial wall of small and large vessels. During development, endothelial
 cells arise from mesodermal progenitors under the stimulus of ﬁbroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2),
 bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and
 organize into primitive tubular networks, a process called vasculogenesis2–4. Subsequently, during the
 process of angiogenesis, this primitive plexus remodels and new vessels sprout and branch until a
 mature circulatory network is formed5. This process requires endothelial cells to specify into tip cells,
 which are highly migratory endothelial cells leading the newly forming vessel, and stalk cells, which
 follow the tip cell, and, through proliferation, contribute to vessel growth5. Stalk cells establish the
 actual lumen for blood transport through various mechanisms such as vacuolar fusion, inverse
 membrane blebbing and cord hollowing6,7.
 Both processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are highly dependent on VEGF-A signaling,
 which has a key role in regulating endothelial cell proliferation and survival8. Depending on the
 organ, mural cells can arise from mesoderm, neural crest or epicardial cells9. In the case of meso-
 dermal pericytes (e.g., heart, lung and gut pericytes) and endothelial cells, both can arise from a
 common mesodermal, ﬂk-1 (VEGFR-2) positive progenitor cell10. During the process of angiogenesis,
 the highly invasive tip cells of newly growing vessels recruit mural cells by platelet-derived growth
 factor beta (PDGF-B) release. In a paracrine manner, PDGF-B stimulates PDGF receptor beta
 (PDGFR-β) on the surface of developing mural cells, leading to the maturation and proliferation of
 pericytes and vSMCs9,11. The interaction between endothelial cells and mural cells stimulates the
 formation of a basement membrane and vessel quiescence and is essential for vascular development
 and blood vessel homeostasis12–14.
 In this protocol we describe how to generate human blood vessel organoids, composed of
 endothelial cells and pericytes, from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)15. After mesoderm

 Fig. 1 | Schematic diagram of the time line for generating blood vessel organoids from hPSCs. The protocol is
 based on a stepwise differentiation of hPSC aggregates with sequential changing of culture media and further
 differentiation into vascular networks in a 3D matrix. After aggregate formation in the presence of Y-27632,
 differentiation is initiated using CHIR99021 and BMP-4 to induce mesoderm, followed by VEGF-A and forskolin
 treatment to trigger vascular development. Aggregates are embedded in a collagen I–Matrigel matrix and stimulated
 with 15% FBS, VEGF-A and FGF-2 for vascular network formation (see upper illustration). Single vascular networks
 are extracted from the gel to generate blood vessel organoids that can be transplanted into NSG mice. A 3D
 reconstruction of a CD31-stained vascular organoid is displayed in the lower panel (scale bar, 200 μm) alongside an

 induction, endothelial networks are formed by vessel sprouting and mature into stable blood vessels
 covered by pericytes and enveloped by a basement membrane. We have previously demonstrated that
 when these blood vessel organoids are transplanted into mice they form a stable and functional
 human vasculature15.


 Development of the protocol
 During development, vascular progenitors, which can give rise to endothelial and mural cells, emerge
 from lateral and posterior mesoderm10. Previous protocols described highly efﬁcient differentiation of
 hPSCs into mesoderm by WNT activation and BMP-4 stimulation, as well as further differentiation
 into endothelial cells upon VEGF-A exposure or into the pericyte/vSMC lineage upon exposure to
 PDGF-B or stimulation by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling16–28. Co-culture of
 separately differentiated endothelial cells and pericytes in 2D, as well as culture of early vascular
 progenitor cells in 3D, has been used previously to generate endothelial/pericyte networks18–20.
 We recently demonstrated the direct differentiation of hPSCs into self-assembling blood vessel
 organoids15. Starting from hPSC aggregates, WNT activation (GSK3β inhibition by CHIR99021) and
 BMP-4 stimulation induced the mesodermal fate. Subsequently VEGF-A and FGF-2 were used to
 induce the vascular cell fate. Those aggregates directly differentiated and grew into a sprouting
 vasculature in 3D collagen I–Matrigel gels driven by VEGF-A and FGF-2 stimulation in the presence
 of serum. Highly branched endothelial networks were generated within 11 d, starting from self-
 renewing hPSCs. Endothelial tubes form a lumen, show tight interaction with pericytes and are
 covered by a continuous basement membrane. Furthermore, cells reminiscent of the tip cell phe-
 notype, characterized by excessive ﬁlopodia formation, can be observed at the angiogenic front of
 sprouting aggregates. We were able to further dissect the vascular networks under a stereomicroscope
 into single blood vessel organoids that could be kept in suspension culture in a 96-well format, which
 allowed for high-throughput screen approaches (Figs. 1 and 2). Differentiated blood vessel organoids
 could be transplanted as a whole into the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice. In mice,
 blood vessel organoids gained access to the mouse vasculature and formed a fully human (endothelial
 cell + mural cell) vasculature in vivo that was stable for >6 months (the end of our observation

 period). In contrast to previous protocols26, vascular organoid transplantation does not require the
 co-transplantation of mouse mesenchymal cells to form a long-lasting vasculature. This is, to our
 knowledge, the ﬁrst detailed protocol for the generation of functional arteries, arterioles and venules
 from hPSCs.


 Alternative methods for generating vascular networks
 Several studies in which vascular networks were generated from hPSCs have been reported. For
 instance, Orlova et al.19 established 2D co-cultures of hPSC-derived endothelial cells and pericytes. In
 this setup, endothelial cells ﬁrst form islands that are surrounded by pericytes and then remodel into
 vessel-like structures, mimicking the formation of a primary vascular plexus. This co-culture
 approach allows the study of endothelial network formation and endothelial cell–pericyte interactions
 in a cell-autonomous manner. For example, if the affected vascular cell type of a disease is unknown,
 co-cultures enable the combination of healthy or patient-derived endothelial cells with pericytes
 from either healthy or affected donors. In blood vessel organoids and protocols that use common
 progenitor cells of endothelial cells and pericytes18, endothelial networks and pericytes are genetically
 identical. However, blood vessel organoids are fully 3D and recapitulate not only endothelial net-
 works and endothelial cell–pericyte interactions but also the formation of a vascular lumen and
 basement membrane deposition.
 Kusuma et al.18 used a synthetic hyaluronic acid-based matrix to differentiate early vascular cells,
 deﬁned as CD105+CD146+, into multicellular networks containing endothelial cells and pericytes.
 Those networks could be transplanted into mice, where the endothelial cells and pericytes integrated
 into the host vasculature. Although the approach of using a synthetic hydrogel holds promise for

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 regenerative medicine, the formation of a chimeric vasculature of human and mouse vascular cells is
 challenging when studying functional aspects of human-derived vasculature. Transplanted blood
 vessel organoids, described here, form an entire PSC-derived vascular bed that can be used to study
 effects exclusively on a human vasculature. Samuel et al.26 generated functional blood vessels in vivo
 by co-transplanting hPSC-derived endothelial cells with either mouse or hPSC-derived mesenchymal
 progenitor cells. Although the mouse stromal cells supported long-term survival of human endo-
 thelium, hPSC-derived mesenchymal cells could sustain the human endothelial networks for only
 ~28 d, which makes it difﬁcult to study long-term effects on a fully human vasculature. The protocol
 we provide here, leads to a functional vasculature in vivo that is composed of hPSC-derived endo-
 thelial cells and pericytes; we have been monitoring growth in immunocompromised mice for
 >6 months.


 Applications and limitations of the protocol
 Differentiating hPSCs as described in this protocol recapitulates key steps of blood vessel develop-
 ment. Endothelial differentiation and sprouting into vascular networks, pericyte differentiation and
 recruitment to endothelial tubes, as well as the generation of a common basement membrane, are
 all key events for successful blood vessel growth and homeostasis5 that can be assessed with this
 protocol. For instance, we have used this protocol to investigate diabetic vascular basement mem-
 brane thickening, a hallmark of diabetic vascular complications, in vitro, by culturing blood vessel
 organoids in high-glucose medium containing the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 (ref. 15).
 Blood vessel organoid cultures in 96-well plates also enable reproducible screening of pharma-
 ceuticals. For example, vascular toxicity of small molecules could be tested, and both viability and
 apoptosis of the human endothelial networks and pericytes could be measured by ﬂuorescence
 microscopy or FACS. Furthermore, endothelial cell adherens junctions or endothelial cell–pericyte
 interaction can be analyzed to assess drug potential to induce or block vascular permeability in
 various environmental settings, such as a pro-inﬂammatory state. We have tested a selection of small
 molecules for their capacity to block diabetes-mediated vascular basement membrane thickening and
 found that the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT ((N-[N-(3,5-diﬂuorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)]-S-phenylgly-
 cine t-butyl ester)) greatly inhibits basement membrane expansion15. Blood vessel organoids could
 therefore serve as a platform to validate compounds from high-throughput screening in 2D cell
 culture systems or could be used to complement pre-clinical models. The number of blood vessel
 organoids needed per drug and concentration to obtain consistent results certainly depends on the
 readout of the screen. For readouts at single-vessel resolution (e.g., vascular basement membrane
 thickness15, endothelial cell–pericyte interaction and adherens junction opening) a low number of
 organoids is sufﬁcient (n = 2–5), because one organoid allows the assessment of many individual
 vessel segments. Screening readouts that compare whole organoids (e.g., measurement of ATP
 production) will certainly require a higher number of organoids per condition (n > 5).
 Furthermore, the transplantation of human blood vessel organoids into diabetic mice (strepto-
 zotocin model for type I diabetes) could recapitulate diabetic vascular basement membrane thick-
 ening and vessel regression. Modeling of human diabetic vasculopathy in an in vivo diabetic setting
 in chimeric mice also allows the measurement of functional vessel parameters such as increased
 permeability in diabetic human vessels15. Thus, this protocol is useful in the study of metabolic
 vascular diseases. Furthermore, this humanized mouse model could be used for preclinical toxicology
 testing, because it allows the effects of drugs or antibodies on human blood vessel physiology and
 disease to be investigated in vivo, complementing other preclinical models. Assessment of functional
 parameters, such as vessel permeability or blood ﬂow, in human blood vessels in response to the
 treatment could result in drugs being moved into clinical trials with greater conﬁdence in their
 safety and efﬁcacy.
 Modeling of rare genetic vascular disease using blood vessel organoids is a further possible
 application. Blood vessel organoids could be differentiated from patient-derived iPSCs with
 inherited forms of vascular diseases29. CRISPR–Cas9 could be used to repair mutations and to
 generate isogenic iPSC control lines30. Alternatively, patient-speciﬁc mutations can be knocked into
 well-established and well-performing hPSCs using CRISPR–Cas9 technology. The speciﬁcation of
 blood vessel organoids in vivo into arteries, arterioles and venules could allow the study of vascular
 diseases originating in capillaries and bigger vessels, as well as that of vascular diseases that arise from
 errors in arterial/venous speciﬁcation, for example, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or arter-
 iovenous malformation31. Of note, our protocol appears robust, and we have now successfully

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 generated blood vessel organoids from 13 different human iPSC and embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines,
 making studies with iPSCs from rare disease patients feasible.
 Besides a broad applicability, the protocol will certainly beneﬁt from further improvements in the
 future. Most importantly, perfused blood vessel organoids are currently available only after trans-
 plantation in vivo, but their establishment in vitro would be an important step forward and could
 allow the investigation of functional parameters such as permeability or immune-cell adhesion/
 extravasation under deﬁned and readily manipulated in vitro conditions. A recent study that applied
 ﬂow to poorly vascularized kidney organoids and showed enhanced vascularization and maturation
 of kidney organoids in vitro is promising32. Moreover, blood vessel organoids currently lack inter-
 action with other somatic cell types. Because blood vessels have to fulﬁll speciﬁc functions and
 are phenotypically very different in each organ33, it will be important to generate organotypic
 blood vessel organoids in the future that allow the investigation of organ-speciﬁc vessel diseases.
 Organotypic blood vessel organoids will also be important for possible tissue-regenerative applica-
 tions in the future.
 A further limitation is the use of animal products in this protocol, namely, the extracellular matrix
 (Matrigel and collagen I) and FBS. Those products show batch-to-batch variation of growth factor
 and protein content, which can impact the efﬁciency of the blood vessel organoid differentiation and
 thus negatively inﬂuence consistency between experiments. Beyond the need for batch testing, the use
 of animal products currently prevents the use of blood vessel organoids as a regenerative medicine in
 humans, an issue that needs to be resolved before moving such blood vessel organoids into human
 patients. To achieve good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliance, the following major changes
 must be applied to this protocol: (i) standardization of cell aggregate size (Steps 1–10), e.g., by
 implementing microwell culture plates34; (ii) use of serum-free media, e.g., vessel-supporting media,
 containing exclusively recombinant growth factors and deﬁned supplements35; and (iii) use of
 synthetic matrices for 3D culture36.


 Experimental design
 We have demonstrated that the protocol is reproducible with three independent hiPSC lines and
 an ESC line (H9)15. Differentiation variability in different hiPSC/hESC lines is a common problem
 with hPSC lines, which may affect the efﬁciency and timing of the protocol. Throughout we describe
 optimization steps that may be required for some hiPSC/hESC lines. In addition, we have slightly
 modiﬁed the ﬁrst steps of our previously published protocol15, and as a consequence it is now 1 week
 shorter and does not require control over oxygen levels. The improved method described here allows
 the generation of hPSC-derived blood vessel organoids over a period of ~16 d.
 Differentiation is achieved through six key steps (Figs. 1 and 2) and starts with the generation of
 cell aggregates in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. The hPSCs should exhibit optimal
 morphology and minimal background differentiation. Furthermore, the successful generation of
 stable aggregates is absolutely critical to achieving an efﬁcient blood vessel differentiation. Therefore,
 the size of the aggregates is crucial and can be inﬂuenced by both the number of cells used and the
 incubation time for aggregate formation. It is possible that both parameters must be optimized for
 each hPSC line used (see ‘Troubleshooting’ section). In this protocol, we use the iPSC line NC8 and
 use 2 × 105 cells per well (of a 6-well plate) for aggregate formation and incubate for 1 d (starting at
 day −1). When we work, for example, with H9 human ESCs, we use 5 × 105 cells per well (of a 6-well
 plate) and incubate for 3 d to obtain proper-size aggregates. Importantly, once stable aggregates with
 a size >50–100 µm in diameter (Fig. 2b) have been formed, the protocol is very robust and can be
 followed as described below without any further modiﬁcations.
 Next, we start to induce mesoderm (day 0 (d0)) by culturing the aggregates in CHIR99021 to
 activate WNT signaling and with BMP-4 for 3 d, before we switch to the vascular induction medium
 containing VEGF-A for 2 d (d3–d5). It is critical to collect the aggregates only by gravitation during
 medium change (d0, d3, d5) and to not apply additional forces by centrifugation. At day 5 (d5), the
 cell aggregates are embedded in a 3D collagen I–Matrigel matrix in 12-well plates. Here, the density of
 embedded aggregates is an important factor that will strongly inﬂuence the differentiation efﬁciency
 of the protocol. Seeding of too many aggregates per well will not provide the space required for the
 sprouting of vascular networks. Furthermore, differentiating aggregates in close proximity will result
 in them merging together into large aggregates, which generally leads to a less efﬁcient differentiation
 process. Very few aggregates, on the other hand, may not be viable and offer only a few vascular
 networks to analyze (Fig. 2e).

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 After 5 d of sprouting (d10), the vascular networks can be assessed for the presence of
 endothelial cells and pericytes and further separated to prepare single blood vessel organoids
 (Fig. 2f–m). Owing to the elastic nature of the collagen I–Matrigel matrix, the whole matrix of one
 well containing 50–60 blood vessel networks can be extracted from the 12-well plate, and vascular
 networks can be liberated under a stereomicroscope, without loss of vascular architecture (Supple-
 mentary Video 1). The singularized networks will self-assemble into round blood vessel organoids
 that can be kept in suspension culture, preferentially in low-attachment 96-well U-bottom plates for
 up to 1 month after generation.
 Once the vascular networks have self-assembled into round blood vessel organoids (Fig. 2l,m), they
 can be transplanted under the kidney capsule of immunocompromised NOD/SCID/IL2Rγnull (NSG)
 mice as previously described for liver organoids37. The human blood vessels stably grow in mice and
 can be identiﬁed by staining with human-speciﬁc antibodies, such as anti-human CD31. Using reporter
 hPSC lines, we showed that in our staining protocol, the anti-human CD31 antibody does indeed only
 react with human endothelial cells15. Moreover, we found that almost all mural cells (>90%), covering
 human endothelium, are also of human origin15. Thus, this protocol generates a fully human
 vasculature that is stable for >6 months and connects to the endogenous mouse circulation. These
 human vessels can be tested for blood vessel perfusion and leakiness, for example, by i.v. injection of a
 human-speciﬁc CD31 antibodies or 70 kDa dextran. At later stages of analysis (~2–3 months after
 transplantation), the formation of arteries, arterioles and venules can be observed15.

Procedure
 Generation and differentiation of hPSC aggregates ● Timing ~6 d
 CRITICAL We cultivate hPSCs under feeder-free conditions using E8 medium and on growth
 c


 factor–reduced Matrigel-coated 6-well plates. Routinely, we passage the cells every 4–5 d using EDTA, as
 previously described38.
 CRITICAL Proper maintenance of hPSCs is critical to efﬁcient vascular differentiation. Seeding
 c


 density and colony size must be closely monitored, and spontaneous background differentiation must be
 kept as low as possible (Fig. 2a).
 1 Wash hPSCs with 0.5 mM EDTA by removing E8 medium and replacing it with 0.6 mL of 0.5 mM
 EDTA per well of a 6-well plate.
 2 Aspirate the EDTA solution, add 0.6 mL of Accutase per well and incubate for 3–5 min at 37 °C.
 Closely monitor cells under the tissue culture microscope until the cells start to round up.
 3 Dissociate the cells from the plate with a P1000 pipette and pipette the cells gently up and down
 (2–3×) to break up aggregates and to generate single cells.
 CRITICAL STEP Do not pipette the cells more than 2–3×, because single hPSCs are sensitive to
 c


 mechanical stress.
 4 Resuspend the cells in 5 mL of aggregation medium using a 5-mL serological pipette and collect the
 cells in a 15-mL Falcon tube.
 5 For cell counting, mix 10 μL of cell suspension and 10 μL of 0.1% Trypan blue solution (included
 with the counting chamber slides) and pipette 10 μL of the mixture onto a counting chamber slide.
 Mix the cell suspension thoroughly before taking the counting aliquot to achieve accurate and
 consistent cell number measurements.
 6 Count viable cells using an automated cell counter or under a microscope.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 7 Calculate the cell suspension volume needed for the experiment (2 × 105 cells per well).
 CRITICAL STEP The cell number required for aggregate formation varies by hPSC line. For cell
 c


 lines that are poor at forming aggregates, the cell number must be adjusted to between 5 × 105 and
 1 × 106 cells per well.
 8 Centrifuge the cells at 300g for 5 min (22–23 °C) and aspirate the medium.
 9 Resuspend the cells in fresh aggregation medium (3 mL per well) containing 50 μM Y-27632.

 10 Place 3 mL of cell suspension per well into a 6-well low-attachment plate and incubate for 1 d until
 cell aggregates with smooth borders (>50- to 100-µm diameter) have been formed (Fig. 2b).
 CRITICAL STEP Efﬁcient aggregate formation is absolutely essential for the success of the


 c
 protocol. Aggregation capacity varies between hPSC lines, and thus the incubation time may need
 to be adjusted from 1 d to 2 or even 3 d.
 11 One day after aggregates have formed (d0), transfer the aggregates to a 15-mL Falcon tube with a
 10-mL serological pipette and wait for the aggregates to settle down by gravitation. Do not discard
 the 6-well plate; save it for later aggregate replating.
 CRITICAL STEP Gentle treatment of aggregates is important. Always collect aggregates by

 c
 gravitation. Centrifugation of cell aggregates is not recommended at any point in the protocol.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 12 After cell aggregates have collected at the bottom of the 15-mL Falcon tube (this may take
 15–20 min), carefully aspirate the medium.
 13 Use a 10-mL serological pipette to gently resuspend the aggregates (3 mL per well) in N2B27
 medium + 12 µM CHIR99021 + 30 ng/mL BMP-4 and transfer the aggregates back to the
 low-attachment plate. Incubate the cells.
 14 Use a P1000 pipette to quickly resuspend the aggregates once per day to avoid excessive fusion of
 aggregates. Incubate for 3 d to induce mesodermal differentiation.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 15 On day 3, transfer the aggregates to a 15-mL tube and wait for them to settle down by gravitation.
 Do not discard the 6-well plate; save it for later aggregate replating.
 16 After cell aggregates have collected at the bottom of the 15-mL Falcon tube, carefully aspirate the
 medium.
 17 Resuspend the aggregates (3 mL per well) in N2B27 medium + 100 ng/mL VEGF-A + 2 µM
 forskolin and transfer the aggregates back to the low-attachment plates. Incubate for 2 more
 days (Fig. 2c).


 Generation of blood vessel networks and organoids ● Timing ~9 d
 18 Calculate the number of wells of a 12-well plate needed for aggregate embedding. We embed one
 full 6-well plate of aggregates in one entire 12-well plate. This usually corresponds to 40–60
 aggregates per well.
 CRITICAL STEP The density of aggregates per well is important. Too dense seeding will lead to
 c


 excessive fusion of blood vessel networks, which makes the analysis and proceeding further with the
 protocol difﬁcult. By contrast, too sparse seeding will result in inefﬁcient vascular network
 formation.
 19 Calculate the total amount of collagen I–Matrigel solution needed. We use 1 mL per well (in total;
 0.5 mL per well for layer 1 + 0.5 mL per well for layer 2, e.g., one entire 12-well plate will require
 12 mL of collagen I–Matrigel solution: 6 mL for layer 1 (4.5 mL of collagen I solution + 1.5 mL of
 Matrigel) + 6 mL (4.5 mL of collagen I solution + 1.5 mL of Matrigel) for layer 2).
 20 Thaw the required Matrigel aliquots on ice.
 21 Pipette the collagen I solution as described above. Carefully mix by pipetting up and down after
 adding PureCol.
 22 Pipette the exact amount of collagen I solution into a fresh 15-mL Falcon tube and place it on ice.
 23 Add Matrigel to collagen I solution and mix thoroughly by carefully pipetting up and down.
 24 Add 0.5 mL of collagen I/Matrigel solution per 12-well plate and swirl the plate equally to distribute
 the solution in the wells.
 25 Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 2 h for solidiﬁcation.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 26 Pipette the aggregates into 15-mL tubes with a 10-mL serological pipette. Collect aggregates by
 gravitation.
 27 Wash the aggregates by aspirating the supernatant and adding 1 mL of StemPro-34 SFM complete
 medium. Repeat the wash once.
 28 Use a P200 pipette to aspirate the medium; remove all remaining medium carefully.
 29 For the second layer, add PureCol to prepare complete collagen I solution.
 30 Prepare the collagen I–Matrigel solution and keep on ice.
 31 Resuspend the aggregates in collagen I–Matrigel solution and keep on ice.

 32 Remove the 12-well plate containing the ﬁrst layer of collagen I–Matrigel from the incubator
 and carefully add 0.5 mL of cell aggregate–collagen I–Matrigel solution to each well of the
 12-well plate.
 33 Distribute the aggregates in the wells by rocking the plate back and forth. Once the aggregates are
 well distributed, slowly move the plate to the incubator.
 CRITICAL STEP The aggregates should be well distributed within the wells to avoid fusion of


 c
 aggregates.
 CRITICAL STEP Once the collagen I–Matrigel solution is at room temperature, the polymeriza-


 c
 tion process will start. Do not rock the plate for longer than 30 s–1 min to avoid disturbing the
 solidiﬁcation process.
 34 Incubate the 12-well plate for 2 h at 37 °C for gel solidiﬁcation.
 35 Add prewarmed (37 °C) StemPro-34 SFM complete medium including 15% FBS, 100 ng/mL
 VEGF-A and 100 ng/mL FGF-2 to induce blood vessel differentiation. Sprouting vessels should
 appear after 1–3 d after embedding.

 c


 addition of medium.

 38 Fix vascular networks (option A) or grow and ﬁx vascular organoids (option B).
 (A) Preparation of vascular networks
 CRITICAL Between 40 and 60 vascular networks can be analyzed from one 12-well culture
 c


 without any expected loss of material during the preparation procedure.
 (i) Carefully aspirate the medium from a well using a P1000 pipette and add 4%
 paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in PBS for 20 min at room temperature.
 CRITICAL STEP PFA fumes will affect cell viability in neighboring wells. If not all the
 c


 wells of the 12-well plate are intended for ﬁxation, use a spatula to carefully lift selected gels
 and use a spoon to transfer the matrix to another 12-well plate for ﬁxation.
 (ii) Remove the PFA solution and add PBS.
 PAUSE POINT Fixed blood vessel networks can be kept in PBS in the refrigerator for up
 j


 to 1 month. Seal the plate with Paraﬁlm to avoid liquid evaporation.
 (iii) To proceed with staining, cut the gels into smaller pieces (1/4–1/2 of a 12-well gel) under a
 stereomicroscope using extra-ﬁne scissors and ﬁne forceps. Avoid cutting through vascular
 networks.
 (iv) Use forceps to transfer the gel fragments to a fresh 2-mL Eppendorf tube.
 (B) Establishment of blood vessel organoids and preparation for staining
 (i) For blood vessel organoid cultures, liberate the entire matrix from the well bottom, using
 the round end of a sterile spatula. Move the spatula toward the well center along the
 bottom of the well until the gel is freely ﬂoating.
 (ii) Under sterile conditions, transfer the gel with a sterile lab spoon to the lid of a 10-cm dish
 (Fig. 2j). Cover the lid with the 10-cm plate bottom and proceed to a horizontal laminar
 ﬂow station equipped with a stereomicroscope.
 (iii) Use two sterile 30-gauge needles to cut out single blood vessel networks and try to reduce
 the amount of excessive matrix surrounding the organoids (as shown in Supplementary
 Video 1). Depending on initial seeding densities, you should expect a full 96-well plate of
 organoids from 2 to 3 wells of a 12-well plate.
 (iv) Transfer single organoids (using a cut P1000 tip) to a 6-well low-attachment plate and add
 5 mL of StemPro-34 SFM complete medium including 15% FBS, 100 ng/mL VEGF-A and
 100 ng/mL FGF-2 and incubate the organoids.
 (v) One day after separating the blood vessel networks (d11), use a cut P1000 tip to transfer
 single organoids to low-attachment round-bottom 96-well ultra-low-attachment plates.
 Add fresh StemPro-34 SFM complete medium including 15% FBS, 100 ng/mL VEGF-A

 Box 1 | Transplantation of blood vessel organoids ● Timing 4 d (8–12 weeks after
 transplantation)

 Procedure
 1 Transplant blood vessel organoids into the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice as previously
 described37. When transplanting, use one blood vessel organoid per kidney and transplant the entire blood
 vessel organoid (Fig. 4a). Transplanted blood vessel organoids can be grown in mice for >6 months.
 CRITICAL STEP Inefﬁcient differentiation could lead to teratoma formation in mice.


 c
 2 Sacriﬁce mice and collect transplanted blood vessel organoids. If only one kidney is used for transplantation,
 the kidney without human transplant should be kept as a negative control.
 3 Fix transplants and kidney tissue in 4% PFA solution overnight at 4 °C.
 4 Dehydrate and parafﬁnize samples according to standard histological procedures.
 5 Cut 2- to 5-μm sections with a standard cryostat and collect them on Ultra Plus slides.
 6 Perform standard de-parafﬁnization procedures.
 7 Follow Steps 39–45 of the Procedure to stain organoids.
 8 Carefully remove all PBS from the slides with a cellulose wipe.
 9 Add a few drops of mounting medium and lay a coverslip on top. Avoid air bubbles.
 10 Dry overnight in the dark at room temperature.
 11 The next day, seal the slide with nail polish.
 12 Proceed to Step 47 of the Procedure to image organoids.


 and 100 ng/mL FGF-2. Around 4 d later (d15), blood vessel organoids should show a
 round and fully encapsulated morphology (Fig. 2k–m).
 CRITICAL STEP Prolonged culture of multiple blood vessel organoids together in one
 c


 well will lead to fusion of organoids. If fusion occurs early in culture, vascular organoids
 can still be separated with two P200 tips.
 (vi) Proceed to ﬁx and analyze the vascular organoids as described in the next step. Once
 conﬁdent the differentiation efﬁciency is adequate (by assessing CD31 and PDGRF-β stainings
 in a whole-mount staining protocol or by FACS analysis), you can also transplant blood vessel
 organoids into the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice as described in Box 1.
 CRITICAL STEP Blood vessel organoids are generally quite resistant to mechanical stress.
 c


 Blood vessel organoids that tend to fall apart during the transplantation process are generally
 of poor quality and should be checked again for viable endothelial cells and pericytes.
 (vii) Transfer blood vessel organoids to a 2-mL Eppendorf tube using a P1000 pipette with
 a cut tip.
 CRITICAL STEP A maximum of ~60 blood vessel organoids can be processed in the same
 c


 tube. Loss of blood vessel organoids during the preparation procedure is not expected.
 (viii) Remove the medium carefully and add 4% PFA in PBS and leave the tube for 1 h at room
 temperature.
 (ix) Remove the PFA solution and add PBS.
 PAUSE POINT Fixed blood vessel organoids can be kept in PBS in the refrigerator for up
 j


 to 1 month.

 Staining of vascular networks and organoids ● Timing 2 d
 39 Add blocking buffer to permeabilize/block the vascular networks/blood vessel organoids/slides for
 2 h at room temperature. For blood vascular networks/blood vessel organoids, add 2 mL of blocking
 buffer per tube and rock tube rack (placed vertically on an orbital shaker) for proper blocking/
 permeabilization. For slides, encircle the tissue with a liquid blocker pen and add 50–100 μL of
 blocking buffer and incubate in a wet chamber.
 40 Remove the blocking buffer and add 50–100 μL of primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer
 (Table 1). Incubate vessel networks/organoids in an upright position on a rocking shaker at 4 °C
 overnight. For sections, incubate in a wet chamber at 4°C overnight.
 41 On the next day, wash the samples three times for 10–15 min in PBS-T solution. For vessel
 networks/organoids, place the tube rack vertically on an orbital shaker for washing.
 42 Add secondary ﬂuorescent antibody (Table 1) in blocking buffer and incubate for 2 h at room
 temperature.
 43 Wash the samples two times for 10–15 min in PBS-T solution.
 44 Add DAPI solution (1:1,000 in PBS) and incubate for 10–15 min.
 45 Wash samples in PBS for 10–15 min.

 (ii) Add a few drops of mounting medium.
 (iii) Place another 22 × 50-mm coverslip on top and squeeze the gel gently. Avoid moving the
 gel out of the coverslip sandwich.
 (iv) Carefully lay coverslips on a piece of Paraﬁlm to avoid adhesion of coverslips to the surface.
 Store coverslips in the dark and dry overnight at room temperature.
 (v) On the next day, the whole coverslip area should be covered by the mounting medium. Use
 nail polish for sealing.
 (B) Mounting of blood vessel organoids ● Timing 2 d
 (i) Glue iSpacers onto one 22 × 50-mm coverslip.
 (ii) Use a P1000 pipette (cut tip) to pipette organoids into molds, and completely remove the
 PBS with a P200 pipette.
 (iii) Add drops of mounting medium and distribute the organoids with a P200 pipette tip.
 (iv) Carefully lay second 22 × 50-mm coverslip on top, remove excess mounting medium and
 dry it in the dark overnight at room temperature.
 (v) On the next day, use nail polish for sealing.


 Confocal imaging of vascular networks/blood vessel organoids ● Timing ~2–6 h
 47 For generating overview images of vascular networks and whole blood vessel organoids (Fig. 2a,e),
 we recommend using a confocal microscope with a 10× objective. For visualization of endothelial-
 cell–pericyte interaction (Fig. 2f,g), we recommend using a 20× objective, and for imaging vascular
 lumen (Fig. 3d) or ﬁlopodia structures (Fig. 3c, right panel), we suggest using a 63× objective.
 z-stacks should be acquired with a z-resolution for proper Nyquist sampling (e.g., enable optimal
 z-sectioning when using ZEN software).

under the kidney capsule of an NSG mouse. Approximately four weeks after transplantation, the human blood vessels are visualized by staining with a

Anticipated results
 This protocol describes the generation of blood vessel organoids from hPSCs and the subsequent
 analysis. Successful differentiation of hPSCs will result in a dense 3D endothelial network that is
 tightly covered by pericytes and surrounded by a common basement membrane. We have success-
 fully generated blood vessel organoids from various human iPSCs, as well as from human ESCs
 (H9 cell line)15.
 The ﬁrst step of the protocol is to successfully generate stable hPSC aggregates that are
 >50–100 μm in size and show a clear border (Fig. 2b). Mesoderm and, subsequently, vascular
 differentiation are induced in suspension culture. Cell aggregates are embedded at d5 of the protocol
 (Fig. 2c), and the ﬁrst vessel sprouts should appear at d6 and d7. At d8, aggregates should display
 extensive radial sprouting and the dense center of the embedded aggregate should disappear (Fig. 2d).
 Successful differentiation will lead to 30–35% endothelial cells (CD31+VE-Cadherin+) and 60–65%
 pericytes (PDGFR-β+)15. At d10, the vascular networks still expand and can be used to generate
 single blood vessel organoids that will be ready for analysis or transplantation at d15 (Fig. 2f–m).
 Whole-mount immunoﬂuorescence (Steps 38–47) is best suited to preserving 3D blood vessel
 architecture. Vascular networks at d10 will exhibit a highly branched and connected CD31+ endo-
 thelial network that is covered by PDGFR-β+ pericytes (Fig. 3a). A collagen type IV+ (Col IV+)
 basement membrane envelopes those vessels (Fig. 3a,b). At the periphery of the sprouting vascular
 networks, active angiogenesis occurs (angiogenic front) and endothelial cells display prototypical tip
 cell morphology, characterized by excessive formation of CD31+ ﬁlopodia (Fig. 3c). At this stage,
 differentiated vessels will already show the formation of lumen lined by endothelial cells (Fig. 3d).
 From these vascular networks, we isolate single blood vessel organoids that will show the fully
 encapsulated morphology at d15. Blood vessel organoids maintain the generated endothelial networks
 and are highly covered with PDGFR-β+ and SMA+ pericytes (Fig. 3e–g).
 The established blood vessel organoids can be cultured in 96-well plates and thus allow for drug-
 screening approaches. Moreover, blood vessel organoids are more stable against mechanical stress

 than the initial vascular networks in 3D gels and can be used for standard immunohistochemistry
 applications and for transplantation into mice.
 The transplantation of blood vessel organoids into immunocompromised mice (Fig. 4a, inset)
 establishes a stable human vasculature within ~4 weeks after transfer that can be visualized by
 human-speciﬁc anti-CD31 immunostaining (Fig. 4a,b). Reporter line experiments showed that >90%
 of the mural cells that cover the human endothelium are also of human origin15. Intravenous
 injections of ﬂuorophore-conjugated anti-human CD31 antibodies or ﬂuorescently labeled dextran
 conﬁrm vessel perfusion and thus connection of PSC-derived human vessels with the blood vessels of
 the host (Fig. 4c,d). Such functional connections and functional blood ﬂow were conﬁrmed in our
 previous study using real-time MRI15 (not described for the current protocol). Permeability mea-
 surements can be performed by assessing leakage of 70-kDa dextran from human CD31+ blood
 vessels. At later stages, vascular organoids, in addition to generating capillaries (Fig. 4e), further
 specify into arterioles (Fig. 4f) and venules (Fig. 4g). Those vessels exhibit the typical expression of
 markers such as Dll4 and EphrinB2 (arterial) or CoupTF2 and EphB4 (venous)15. At later stages
 (>3 months after transplantation), we do observe invasion of human endothelial cells into the mouse
 kidney. To control for human speciﬁcity of antibodies, it is best to use a kidney that has not been
 transplanted with human tissue and will not stain positive for human-speciﬁc anti-CD31 antibodies
 (Fig. 4h).
