Protocol


Seeding and attachment of hPSCs for differentiation
Accurate and consistent seeding density are important to differentiation outcome and
reproducibility of the PT-enhanced organoid protocol. The iPSCs are consistently seeded for
differentiation onto Laminin-coated 12-well plates 2 d post-passaging, at which time the iPSC
culture has reached ~80% confluency, at a density of 25,000 cells per well (Steps 10–24). The
number of wells is calculated at Step 10 to ensure adequate organoids for control and test
conditions in downstream analyses (Steps 54–91), including functional assays (PT-specific
uptake of fluorescently labeled substrates) and immunofluorescence.

Differentiation of iPSCs to metanephric mesenchyme and PT-enhanced organoid
generation
Amongst other differences, the monolayer differentiation stage of this protocol has been
prolonged compared with our previous methodology9,10, with organoid generation occurring
at day 13 (Step 31), and utilises both TeSR-E6 and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium/Nutrient
Mixture F12 (DMEM/F12) basal medium. Differentiation is commenced 24 h post-seeding
by exposing the iPSCs to TeSR-E6 containing 6 µM CHIR99021 followed by 200 ng/mL FGF9
for 5 and 2 d, respectively, inducing posterior intermediate mesoderm and metanephric
mesenchyme (Steps 25–28). Further specification and support of the metanephric mesenchyme
population occurs from day 8 to 13 of differentiation (Step 29) through the addition of nephron
progenitor maintenance medium, adapted from a previous method11 to increase BMP7
levels6. Organoids are generated at day 13 of differentiation using our standard centrifugation
technique9 with TesR-E6 medium10 and are cultured for 14 d (day 27, representing the D13 + 14
timepoint in the original research related to this manuscript6) before collection (Figs. 1 and 2).
While the organoids may be suitable for functional and protein expression analyses described
below at earlier or later timepoints, day 27 is the most frequently assessed timepoint in our
laboratory, maximizing the maturation time before off-target populations such as cartilage are
visible by brightfield microscopy.

Functional and protein expression analyses of developed PT-enhanced organoids
To establish organoid patterning and maturity, a portion of the organoids are fixed at
Step 53, 14 d post-aggregation (day 27; representing the D13 + 14 timepoint6), for subsequent
immunofluorescence of PT-specific markers (Steps 74–91), while the remaining organoids
are used for fluorescent substrate uptake assays (Steps 54–73). The albumin uptake assay,
using tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated albumin to measure megalin–cubilin
activity56, is commenced first to account for its longer duration. During the incubation
step with TRITC–albumin, it is possible to complete the assay for PT-specific organic cation
transport via Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion Protein 1/2 (MATE-1/MATE-2), which utilizes DAPI
as a surrogate substrate57. Imaging of the live organoids from both functional assays, as well
as the fixed organoids following immunofluorescence, are performed using laser scanning
confocal microscopy (Steps 61, 73 and 91). The resulting PT-enhanced organoids are considered
successfully patterned based on the presence of radiating nephrons that take up fluorescently
labeled albumin and DAPI (Fig. 3), express PT-specific proteins (Fig. 4) and bind Lotus
tetragonobulus lectin (LTL) on their apical membrane (Fig. 4).
