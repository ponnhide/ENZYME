 Organoids are biomimetic tissue models comprising multiple cell types and cell states. Post-translational modiﬁcation
 (PTM) signaling networks control cellular phenotypes and are frequently dysregulated in diseases such as cancer.
 Although signaling networks vary across cell types, there are limited techniques to study cell type–speciﬁc PTMs in
 heterocellular organoids. Here, we present a multiplexed mass cytometry (MC) protocol for single-cell analysis of PTM
 signaling and cell states in organoids and organoids co-cultured with ﬁbroblasts and leukocytes. We describe how thiol-
 reactive organoid barcoding in situ (TOBis) enables 35-plex and 126-plex single-cell comparison of organoid cultures and
 provide a cytometry by time of ﬂight (CyTOF) signaling analysis pipeline (CyGNAL) for computing cell type–speciﬁc PTM
 signaling networks. The TOBis MC protocol takes ~3 d from organoid ﬁxation to data acquisition and can generate single-
 cell data for >40 antibodies from millions of cells across 126 organoid cultures in a single MC run.

 Introduction
 Organoids are self-organizing biomimetic 3D structures comprising both stem and differentiated
 cells1. Organoids recapitulate many core features of tissue biology and are empowering scientists to
 study both healthy and diseased tissues in vitro2. Healthy organoid models of the intestine3, liver4,
 brain5 and pancreas6 have been developed, as well as patient-derived organoids (PDOs) as avatars of
 personalized cancer therapy7–9. Although incredibly powerful, organoids are heterogeneous model
 systems that are challenging to analyze by using conventional technologies.
 Cells within an organoid can be classiﬁed with a ‘cell type’ (e.g., stem and differentiated) and a ‘cell
 state’ (e.g., proliferating and quiescent)—with cell type often relating to cell state. For example, stem
 cells in small intestinal organoids are often in S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle, whereas terminally
 differentiated enterocytes are post-mitotic or apoptotic10. Biological processes within all cells are
 regulated by protein post-translational modiﬁcation (PTM) signaling networks11. Common PTMs
 include protein phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination12. PTM signaling net-
 works are frequently dysregulated in cancer, and PTM signaling nodes such as kinases are targeted by
 many anti-cancer drugs13. Because PTM signaling networks are cell type–14 and cell state–speciﬁc15,
 heterocellular organoids contain several cell type– and cell state–speciﬁc PTM networks simulta-
 neously (Fig. 1). Experimental manipulation of organoid cultures such as drug treatments and
 CRISPR-mediated genome edits can further alter the cell types, cell states and PTM signaling net-
 works in organoids. Unfortunately, low-dimensional technologies commonly applied to organoids
 cannot measure such high-dimensional changes and therefore fail to capture the complexity of
 organoid biology16. To fully use organoids in biomedical research, we must be able to quantify and
 compare multiple organoid PTM signaling networks in a cell type– and cell state–speciﬁc manner.
 We recently described a mass cytometry (MC) (also known as cytometry by time-of-ﬂight
 (CyTOF)) method to perform cell type–speciﬁc PTM network analysis of organoids and organoid co-
 cultures17. Through the use of heavy metal–tagged probes and antibodies, MC enables >40 protein-
 level measurements at single-cell resolution across millions of cells18. When combined with a thiol-
 reactive organoid barcoding in situ (TOBis) strategy, this method enabled cell type– and cell
 state–speciﬁc comparison of 28-node PTM networks between 20 different organoid cultures in a
 single experiment17. TOBis MC revealed an intimate relationship between cell type, cell state and
 PTM signaling in small intestinal organoids and uncovered a novel connection between oncogenic

 noid co-cultures17.


 Overview of the procedure
 Here, we provide a detailed step-by-step protocol to perform TOBis MC analysis of organoids and
 organoid co-cultures (Fig. 2). The TOBis MC protocol comprises four stages: (i) organoid culture and
 pretreatment (Steps 1–7), (ii) organoid in situ barcoding with TOBis (Steps 8–10), (iii) organoid
 single-cell dissociation followed by metal-antibody staining and MC data acquisition (Steps 11–49)
 and (iv) demultiplexing of TOBis-barcoded experimental conditions and downstream data analysis
 (Steps 50–70). The protocol was originally established to study cell type–speciﬁc PTM signaling in
 murine heterocellular organoids by using a 20-plex TOBis barcoding strategy (via a 6-choose-3
 combination, i.e., 3 isotopes ‘on’ and 3 isotopes ‘off’)17. We have since adapted the method to work
 with smaller 96-well plate organoid cultures, expanded TOBis MC to higher-throughput 35-plex
 (7-choose-3) and 126-plex (9-choose-4) formats, demonstrated that the protocol is compatible with
 human PDOs and developed CyGNAL (CyTOF signaling analysis), a computational pipeline for
 analyzing high-dimensional PTM signaling MC data.


 Comparison with other methods
 Immunoﬂuorescent technologies are limited by the spectral overlap of reporters, susceptible to
 autoﬂuorescent artefacts and inherently low dimensional. Immunoﬂuorescent imaging parameters

Fig. 2 | TOBis MC protocol overview. Live organoids are treated with 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (identifying S-phase cells) and phosphatase and
protease inhibitors (Procedure Steps 1–3). Organoids are then ﬁxed in situ with paraformaldehyde and stained with 194cisplatin (194Cisp) to identify
dead/dying cells (Steps 4–7). Organoids from different experimental conditions are barcoded with TOBis reagents while still in Matrigel (Fig. 3),
washed with reduced glutathione (GSH) and pooled (Steps 8–10). Organoids are dissociated into single cells by using dispase II, collagenase IV and
DNase I and stained with extracellular cell-type rare earth metal-conjugated antibodies (Abs) (Steps 11–24). Cells are then permeabilized with Triton
and methanol, stained with intracellular PTM, cell-state and cell-type Abs (Steps 25–33). Abs are cross-linked to their antigens by using formaldehyde
(FA), and cells are incubated with 191/193Iridium (Ir) DNA intercalators (Steps 34–37). Single cells are analyzed by using a mass cytometer (Steps
38–49). Different experimental conditions are debarcoded and preprocessed, and single-cell organoid data are visualized by using uniform manifold
approximation and projection (UMAP) (Steps 50–60). Cell type–speciﬁc PTM node intensity is calculated by using earth mover’s distance (EMD)
between reference (R) and variable (V) populations, and PTM-PTM connectivity is calculated by using density resampled estimation of mutual
information (DREMI) (Steps 61–70). CSB, cell staining buffer (see Reagents); m/z, mass-to-charge ratio; TOF-MS, time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer.

 can be expanded through multiple cycles of staining and quenching19, but this is challenging to
 implement on heterogeneous and delicate 3D organoid cultures. Although ﬂuorescent ﬂow cytometry
 parameters can be increased by using compensation strategies, these workﬂows are complex and not
 well suited to the dozens of intracellular measurements required for routine multiplexed PTM net-
 work analysis20. In contrast to ﬂuorescent technologies, the Dalton-level mass resolution of MC
 instruments21 enables >40 extracellular, intracellular and nuclear monoisotopic heavy metal channels
 to be measured at the single-cell level18.
 High-throughput drug and CRISPR organoid screens rely on bulk viability measurements such as
 CellTitre-Glo7,9. Such assays cannot provide cell type–speciﬁc readouts from co-cultures, lack detailed
 cell-state proﬁling and provide no mechanistic insight into organoid phenotypes. Moreover, bulk
 -omics and low-dimensional ﬂuorescent technologies also struggle to provide multiplexed cell
 type–speciﬁc PTM signaling data from organoid co-cultures. In contrast, TOBis MC provides cell
 type–speciﬁc cell-state quantiﬁcation and PTM signaling networks for every cell in an organoid
 culture. The high-parameter capacity of MC is particularly suited to analyzing PTM signaling in
 organoids co-cultured with stromal ﬁbroblasts and leukocytes17.
 High-dimensional phenotyping of heterocellular systems is commonly performed by using single-
 cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)22,23. Although a mature technology to identify transcriptionally regulated
 differentiation trajectories, scRNA-seq workﬂows to measure intracellular proteins, PTMs and bio-
 chemical processes24 are in their infancy. New scRNA-seq methods using intracellular oligo-tagged
 antibodies have been reported25,26, but such methods have not yet been applied to organoids. In
 comparison, TOBis MC is explicitly designed for highly multiplexed protein and PTM measurements.
 Moreover, because viable cells are needed to achieve suitable read depth and reliable data inter-
 pretation for scRNA-seq, dead cells are usually removed during scRNA-seq sample preparation, and

 stressed cells are excluded in data analysis. Common scRNA-seq workﬂows are therefore heavily
 biased toward healthy cells and not well suited to analyzing cell death in organoids (as might be
 common in a PDO drug screen7). By contrast, MC can analyze viable, stressed and dead cells and is
 therefore capable of assessing apoptotic mechanisms in perturbed organoid cultures.
 Cell states and PTM signaling are dynamic processes that are rapidly altered by single-cell dis-
 sociation27,28. Therefore, organoids should be ﬁxed before dissociation to accurately preserve cell
 states and labile PTM signals for molecular analysis. Unfortunately, most scRNA-seq methods are
 incompatible with paraformaldehyde (PFA)-ﬁxed cells23. In contrast, MC is fully compatible with
 PFA ﬁxation and can accurately measure cell states and PTMs from PFA-ﬁxed organoids. Although
 droplet-based scRNA-seq methods have greatly improved cell throughput29,30, leading commercial
 platforms (such as 10x Genomics) are commonly limited to ~1–10 × 103 cells per run. Given that a
 typical 12-well plate organoid culture contains ~0.5–1 × 106 cells per well, droplet-based scRNA-seq
 methods can capture only ~0.1–1% of the cells in such an experiment. In comparison, TOBis MC
 routinely analyzes >1 × 106 single cells and can therefore provide a more holistic view of organoid
 cultures. Once the protocol is established, data generation is also very rapid. We typically go from
 ﬁxed organoid cultures to single-cell PTM data in ~3–4 d. Finally, by barcoding organoids very early
 in the protocol, TOBis reduces technical variation between samples in downstream steps (e.g.,
 antibody staining) and increases single-cell recovery17.

 Limitations
 Because TOBis MC requires organoids to be dissociated into a single-cell suspension, all spatial
 information is lost. Methods such as imaging mass cytometry31, multiplexed ion beam imaging31 or
 in situ scRNA-seq32 should be considered when high-dimensional spatial phenotyping is required.
 Although MC can in theory be used to measure any cell sample that can be dissociated into single
 cells, we have not optimized TOBis for tissue samples. We recommend methods speciﬁcally opti-
 mized for ﬁxed tissue such as DISSECT28 for measuring PTM signaling in tissue. MC cannot describe
 intercellular signaling mediated by the thousands of ligand–receptor interactions responsible
 for transducing signals between cells. We suggest using scRNA-seq ligand–receptor analysis such
 as CellPhoneDB33,34, NicheNet35 or CellChat36 to study intercellular communication in organoid
 co-cultures.
 Although we have expanded the capacity of TOBis multiplexing to up to 126 different organoid
 cultures, this is still far below the thousands of conditions assessed in high-throughput screening
 applications7. We therefore still recommend bulk viability measurements when mono-culture assay
 throughput is paramount.
 Like all immunostaining methods, MC is heavily dependent on high-quality antibody reagents.
 Although many PTM and cell-state antibodies are well validated for MC, organoid cell-type iden-
 tiﬁcation antibodies are typically less established. Users are advised to screen and validate cell-type
 identiﬁcation antibodies when applying this protocol to novel organoid cultures. Like most MC
 experiments, the cost of TOBis MC is dominated (75–80%) by the price of metal-conjugated
 antibodies (Supplementary Table 1).

 Applications
 We have successfully applied TOBis multiplexing to 6-well, 12-well, 48-well and 96-well organoid
 culture formats to study cell type–speciﬁc PTM signaling networks in organoids and organoids co-
 cultured with stromal and immune cells17. The protocol is also well suited to studying how organoid
 signaling networks can be regulated by stromal and immune cells, including cellular therapies such as
 chimeric antigen receptor T cells (C.J.T. and Callum Nattress, University College London Cancer
 Institute, unpublished observations, 2021). We have successfully applied TOBis MC to multiple
 genotypic and microenvironmental conditions17. Although the workﬂow was developed by using
 murine intestinal organoids, the protocol is compatible with human PDO drug and perturbation
 screens7 where mechanisms of cell death and insight into drug resistance are of interest.

 Experimental design
 Organoid culture
 This protocol is designed to measure cell type–speciﬁc PTM signaling networks in organoids cultured
 in a protein-rich extracellular matrix such as Matrigel. Organoids can be grown in 6-well (×7 40-µl
 droplets), 12-well (×3 30-µl droplets), 48-well (×1 30-µl droplet) and 96-well (×1 50-µl stack) culture

 both newly seeded and fully developed organoids17. The current protocol is optimized for intestinal
 organoids derived from mouse (Fig. 3) and human (Fig. 4) stem cells cultured in conventional
 organoid media3, but it is theoretically applicable to all Matrigel-based organoid models (e.g., the
 liver4, pancreas6, lung37, stomach38, uterus39 and various cancers40) and organoid co-cultures (Fig. 5).
 Given the highly multiplexed nature of TOBis MC, careful consideration should be given to

 experimental design at the organoid culture stage. We advise users to culture each condition in
 technical triplicate and to include baseline untreated controls to aid downstream data analysis
 (see Step 66).

 Organoid preﬁxation treatment
 After organoid culture, 1275-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (127IdU) is added to the media of live organoid
 cultures 30 min before the assay endpoint. 127IdU integrates into the replicating genome of cells in
 S phase and can be easily monitored by MC41. 5 min before the endpoint, a cocktail of protease and
 phosphatase inhibitors can be added to the organoid culture media to protect protein and phos-
 phorylation epitopes, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1). We advise users to optimize the use of any
 such pretreatments with their own biological system and antibody panels.

 Organoid ﬁxation and dead-cell staining
 Dissociation of live tissue can alter cell states27 and PTM signaling proﬁles28. To avoid disruption of
 in situ cell states and PTMs in organoids, organoids are ﬁxed while still in Matrigel. At the assay

 endpoint, culture medium is removed and replaced with 4% (wt/vol) PFA and incubated at 37 °C for
 60 min. Fixed organoids are then washed with PBS and stained with monoisotopic cisplatin (e.g.,
 194
 cisplatin or 198cisplatin) for 10–15 min (Supplementary Fig. 2). Cisplatin enters cells with com-
 promised membranes faster than cells with intact membranes and can therefore be used to identify
 dead and dying cells in organoid cultures42.

 TOBis multiplexing
 Mass-tagged cellular barcoding is used in MC experiments to increase sample throughput, reduce
 technical variation and decrease rare earth metal-conjugated antibody usage43,44. Unfortunately,
 commercial palladium mass-tagged cellular barcoding reagents (commonly used for barcoding leu-
 kocytes in suspension) are not suitable for labeling organoids while embedded in Matrigel17. To
 overcome this, we developed TOBis based on monoisotopic tellurium maleimide (TeMal)45 and
 cisplatin46 that can label organoids while still in Matrigel17 (Fig. 3a,b). We originally reported a 20-
 plex doublet-ﬁltering barcoding matrix based on 124Te, 126Te, 128Te, 130Te, 196Pt and 198Pt (using a 6-
 choose-3 combination strategy, i.e., 3 isotopes ‘on’ and 3 isotopes ‘off’)17. Through the addition of
 122
 Te, 123Te and 125Te TeMals, we have now expanded TOBis to support 35-plex (7-choose-3)
 (Fig. 3c) or 126-plex (9-choose-4) multiplexing (Fig. 3d).
 We premix TeMals and cisplatins into TOBis barcodes either by hand or by using an Opentrons
 OT-2 robot (https://github.com/TAPE-Lab/OT-2-Automated-Barcode-Pipetting) and store as ready-
 to-use kits. We typically use 35-plex TOBis for day-to-day experiments and reserve 126-plex bar-
 coding for screening applications. On the day of the experiment, the TOBis barcodes are added to
 organoid cultures and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following day, unbound thiol-reactive
 barcodes are quenched by using reduced glutathione and washed from the cultures (Fig. 3b). These
 quenching and washing steps avoid unbound barcodes cross-reacting with off-target organoid cells

 when all cultures are subsequently pooled17. When used as described in this protocol, TOBis
 achieved a barcoding accuracy of >99% (Fig. 4) and can be used to stain up to 2 million cells per well
 of a 96-well plate culture (Supplementary Fig. 3). TOBis can be used to multiplex mouse or human
 organoids and organoids co-cultured with other cell types in 3D, such as stromal ﬁbroblasts and
 leukocytes (Fig. 5).


 Organoid single-cell dissociation and rare earth metal-conjugated antibody staining
 After TOBis staining, each organoid culture is removed from Matrigel and resuspended in a dis-
 sociation buffer containing dispase II, collagenase IV and DNase I. During optimization, we found
 that dispase II breaks cell–cell contacts, collagenase IV digests Matrigel components and DNase I
 degrades genomic DNA released from dead cells commonly found in organoid cultures. Dissociation
 enzymes affect cell recovery and antibody staining and should be optimized carefully for each
 biological system and antibody panel (Supplementary Fig. 4). TOBis barcoded organoids from each
 condition are pooled into a single master tube and then dissociated into single cells by using a
 gentleMACS Octo dissociator. After dissociation, single organoid cells are washed and ﬁltered to
 remove clumps. Cells are then stained for extracellular epitopes with rare earth metal-labeled anti-
 bodies (hereafter referred to as metal antibodies). Preconjugated metal antibodies can be purchased
 via Fluidigm or custom conjugated by using established protocols47. Cells are then permeabilized by
 using 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 50% (vol/vol) methanol or both. Permeabilization buffers can
 greatly alter antibody staining and should be optimized for each biological system and antibody panel
 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Once permeabilized, cells are stained with a panel of metal antibodies against
 intracellular proteins and PTMs. Cells are then washed, and antibodies are cross-linked to their
 epitopes by using 1.6% (wt/vol) formaldehyde (FA). Finally, cells are incubated in DNA intercalator
 191/193
 Ir overnight before MC single-cell data acquisition and analysis.


 MC single-cell data acquisition
 Stained organoid cells are washed into water containing 2 mM EDTA, diluted to 0.8–1.2 × 106 cells/
 ml and spiked with isotopic EQ beads48. Cells are then loaded into a Super Sampler (Victorian
 Airships), and single-cell data are acquired by using a mass cytometer (e.g., Fluidigm Helios). During
 optimization, we found that adding 2 mM EDTA to the running buffer and using the Super Sampler
 greatly improve the acquisition of epithelial organoid cells by MC (J.S. and X.Q., unpublished
 observation, 2018).


 TOBis MC single-cell data analysis
 After data acquisition, raw MC data are normalized48 and exported as standard FCS ﬁle(s). Multi-
 plexed TOBis experiments are debarcoded44 (https://github.com/zunderlab/single-cell-debarcoder)
 into individual conditions (Fig. 6a), imported into Cytobank (http://www.cytobank.org/) or an
 equivalent cytometry data analysis platform (e.g., FlowJo) and gated with Gaussian parameters to
 remove debris, DNA/cisplatin to identify live cells and cell-type markers to remove doublets (Fig. 6b).
 The fully gated datasets containing cells of interest are further processed with our MC data analysis
 pipeline, CyGNAL (https://github.com/TAPE-Lab/CyGNAL)49 (Supplementary Fig. 6). The com-
 ponents of CyGNAL were previously used to analyze the datasets described by Qin et al.17. In brief,
 the preprocessing step formats and exports the heavy metal channels (based on the naming con-
 vention of the Fluidigm CyTOF software), embeds the metadata of the experiment and assigns each
 event within the dataset a unique cell index. Dimensionality reduction (e.g., uniform manifold
 approximation and projection (UMAP)50) can be performed on cell-comprised datasets and is mainly
 used as a visualization tool in our workﬂow (Fig. 6c). Cells can be assigned a cell-type identity via
 biaxial gating (Fig. 6d), followed by cell-state identiﬁcation and PTM analysis in a cell type–speciﬁc
 manner (Fig. 6e,f). Earth mover’s distance (EMD)51,52 is used to quantify PTM node intensity, and
 density resampled estimation of mutual information (DREMI)53 is used to score PTM-PTM edge
 connectivity. Multiple EMD/DREMI values can be visualized with heatmaps and further summarized
 by using principal component analysis (PCA). When paired with a well-curated antibody panel and
 robust experimental design, TOBis MC allows multiplexed analysis of cell type–speciﬁc PTM sig-
 naling of heterocellular organoids17.

 Murine colonic organoid monoculture and co-culture medium
 Murine colonic organoid monoculture and co-cultures are maintained in advanced DMEM/F-
 12 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine, 10 mM HEPES, 1× B-27

 Experimental design), and users should alter the composition of the organoid culture media on the basis

 Heavy metal–conjugated antibodies
 Metal antibodies can be purchased preconjugated from Fluidigm or custom conjugated with
 monoisotopic heavy metals purchased from Fluidigm or Trace Sciences by using X8 polymers as per
 established protocols47. We advise users to develop custom metal-conjugated antibody panels spe-
 ciﬁcally for their biological questions and titrate their panels (using 1 µg of antibody/ml of CSB as a
 starting point) with prior knowledge such as antigen abundance and heavy metal monoisotopic
 impurities55,56. In our experience, cell state (e.g., proliferating, quiescent and apoptosis) has a con-
 siderable inﬂuence on PTM signaling17. We therefore strongly advise users to include cell cycle
 (e.g., pRB (S807/S811), cyclin B1, geminin, PLK1 and pHistone H3 (S28))15,41,57 and apoptosis
 (e.g., cCaspase3 (D175) and cPARP (D214)) markers in their panels. Particular care should be taken
 to validate cell-type identiﬁcation antibodies that have not previously been used in MC. Ideally more
 than two cell-type identiﬁcation antibodies should be used per cell type. An example metal antibody
 panel for studying murine small intestinal organoid cells is provided in Supplementary Table 2.

 TOBis
 Debarcoding efﬁciency is heavily dependent on robust signal intensities of the Te and Pt channels.
 Because barcode signal intensities can vary between isotopologues, barcode batch and cell types being
 labeled, we advise titrating TeMal and cisplatin barcodes to achieve an ‘on’ median intensity >5 × 102
 and an ‘off’ median intensity <1 × 102 in desired cell types (Fig. 3c,d). We use TeMals at
 122
 Te = 2.2 µM, 123Te = 2.0 µM, 124Te = 1.8 µM, 125Te = 1.5 µM, 126Te = 1.5 µM, 128Te = 1.1 µM
 and 130Te = 0.96 µM and both cisplatins at 196Pt and 198Pt = 125 nM (diluted in PBS). These
 concentrations offset the differential mass-range sensitivity of MC instruments and the alternative
 thiol-reactive functional groups of TeMal (maleimide) and cisplatin (chloride).
 In practice, we prepare TOBis barcodes either by hand or robot (see below) and divide them into
 aliquots as ready-to-use kits (stored in 96-well PCR plates). TeMals and cisplatins can be mixed at
 desired concentrations according to the barcoding matrix (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) manually
 or by using a liquid-handling robot. Scripts to prepare both 35-plex (7-choose-3) and 126-plex
 (9-choose-4) TOBis barcodes by using the OT-2 platform (Opentrons) are provided at https://github.
 com/TAPE-Lab/OT-2-Automated-Barcode-Pipetting. Premixed TOBis barcodes can be kept at
 −80 °C for long-term storage before use. Although this protocol is designed for TeMal and cisplatin
 reagents, alternative thiol-reactive heavy metal probes (e.g., lanthanide-conjugated mDOTA
 (maleimide dodecane tetraacetic acid)17) could also, in theory, be used to perform TOBis.

Procedure
 CRITICAL TOBis MC can be used to assess organoids cultured in 6-, 12-, 48- or 96-well formats. This
 c


 protocol describes how to analyze intestinal organoids grown either in monoculture or co-cultured with
 intestinal ﬁbroblasts and/or primary bone marrow–derived macrophages in a 96-well plate. Users are
 advised to deploy their own optimized organoid culture conditions as inputs for TOBis MC.

4908 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | OCTOBER 2021 | 4897–4918 | www.nature.com/nprot

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 Culture organoids
 1 Culture organoids (or organoid co-cultures) in 50 µl of Matrigel and 200 µl of medium in a
 standard 96-well tissue culture plate.
 CRITICAL STEP For the results illustrated in this paper, we have cultured murine intestinal organoids


 c
 (Fig. 3), human CRC PDOs (Fig. 4) and murine organoids co-cultured with colonic ﬁbroblasts and/or
 macrophages (Fig. 5) for 3 d in 50 µl of Matrigel and 200 µl of medium. Users should use optimized
 culture conditions relevant to their own organoids and biological questions as inputs for TOBis MC.

 S phase cell labeling ● Timing ~30 min
 2 Add 127IdU directly to culture medium to a ﬁnal concentration of 25 µM (10 µl of 0.5 mM stock
 added to 200 µl of medium). Gently rotate the plate by hand ﬁve times for 10 s to mix the medium
 and incubate the plate for 25 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.
 CRITICAL STEP 127IdU incubation enables identiﬁcation of S phase cells.
 c


 Phosphatase and protease inhibitor treatment ● Timing ~5 min
 3 Add the protease inhibitor cocktail (100× stock; see Reagents) and PhosSTOP (40× stock; see
 Reagents) directly to culture medium, gently rotate the plate by hand ﬁve times for 10 s and
 incubate for 5 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.
 CRITICAL STEP Protease and phosphatase inhibitors have been shown to help preserve cell
 c


 signaling and antigen stability during ﬁxation28. However, because prolonged treatment may
 introduce technical artefacts, we advise users to empirically determine the duration of the treatment
 according to their experimental system and antibody panel (Supplementary Fig. 1).

 Fixation ● Timing ~80 min
 4 Remove culture medium by pipetting. Add 200 µl of prewarmed (37 °C) 4% (vol/vol) PFA into each
 well, taking care not to disrupt Matrigel. Incubate for 60 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.
 CRITICAL STEP PFA ﬁxation in situ ensures that labile cell-state and PTM proﬁles are preserved
 c


 during the downstream sample handling.
 CRITICAL STEP Matrigel can dissolve in cold PFA. It is therefore important to prewarm PFA to 37 °C.
 c c


 CRITICAL STEP Some antibodies are sensitive to ﬁxation. PFA concentrations ranging from 1.6%
 to 4% were proved to be functional, but we encourage users to determine the optimal concentration
 of PFA for their speciﬁc antibody panel.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 5 Remove PFA solution by pipetting, taking care not to disturb the Matrigel. Wash the cells with PBS
 on a rocker (speed set at ~45 rpm throughout the protocol) for 10 min at room temperature
 (~20 °C). Repeat the wash.
 PAUSE POINT Fixed cells can be kept at 4 °C in PBS. We advise users to determine the maximal
 j


 storage time with their speciﬁc culture systems.

 Live/dead discrimination ● Timing ~30 min
 6 Remove PBS by pipetting. Add 200 µl of 0.25 µM 194cisplatin/PBS solution to each well and
 incubate for 10–15 min on a rocker at room temperature.
 CRITICAL STEP Because dead cells can be found inside organoid structures (Fig. 1), it is crucial that
 c


 organoids be stained for long enough that all cells have the opportunity to bind cisplatin. However,
 organoids can also be easily overstained with cisplatin; it is therefore important that cultures are stained
 for the same duration of time and that this step does not exceed 20 min (Supplementary Fig. 2).
 7 Remove the 194cisplatin solution by pipetting. Wash cells with PBS on a rocker for 10 min at room
 temperature. Repeat the wash.
 CRITICAL STEP Proceed to the next steps on the same day. Long-term storage of cisplatin-
 c


 stained cells in situ will lead to cisplatin overstain that confounds live/dead cell discrimination.
 CRITICAL STEP If barcoding multiple organoid samples, continue to Step 8. If only one organoid
 c


 culture condition is being analyzed, skip to Step 11.

 TOBis (optional) ● Timing ~30 min of bench work; incubation overnight
 8 Transfer 200 µl of pre-aliquoted TOBis barcodes to corresponding organoid samples in a 96-well
 plate (from Step 7). Any barcode combination can be used to stain any culture condition
 (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Incubate the cells overnight at 4 °C.

 CRITICAL STEP Record the sample barcode assignments. Different samples labeled with the same


 c
 TOBis barcode should not be pooled together.
 CRITICAL STEP Ensure that correct amounts of TOBis barcode are added to each well for


 c
 successful debarcoding.
 CRITICAL STEP TOBis barcodes should not be used to stain >1 million cells per well of a 96-well


 c
 culture (Supplementary Fig. 3). In practice, culturing >1 million cells per well of a 96-well plate is
 uncommon. The users are advised to count cells at seeding if high-density cultures are needed.
 9 Remove the barcoding solutions by pipetting and wash the cells with 200 µl of 2 mM glutathione/
 CSB for 10 min on a rocker at room temperature. Repeat the wash twice.
 CRITICAL STEP Reduced glutathione quenches unused thiol-reactive TOBis barcodes, thereby
 c
 enabling efﬁcient discrimination of ‘on’ and ‘off’ signals for sample demultiplexing.
 10 Wash the cells with 200 µl of PBS for 10 min on a rocker at room temperature. Repeat the wash.
 PAUSE POINT The barcoded cells can be kept at 4 °C for ≤4 weeks in PBS.

 Single-cell dissociation ● Timing ~90 min
 11 Make up a dissociation solution of fresh 0.5 mg/ml dispase II, 0.2 mg/ml collagenase IV and 0.2 mg/
 ml DNase I in PBS at room temperature.
 CRITICAL STEP Dissociation enzymes can affect cell recovery and antibody performance
 c


 (Supplementary Fig. 4). We encourage users to test and titrate alternative dissociation enzymes for
 the speciﬁc cellular composition of their experimental system.
 CRITICAL STEP Using freshly prepared enzyme solutions ensures optimal and reproducible
 c


 enzyme activity.
 12 Remove PBS from the wells by pipetting and add the dissociation solution.
 13 Scrape Matrigel droplets and pool all cells from all conditions with dissociation solution to a
 gentleMACS C-Tube. Top up the dissociation solution to 5 ml/C-Tube.
 CRITICAL STEP Do not overload the gentleMACS C-Tubes. We encourage users to empirically
 c


 determine how much dissociation buffer is needed on the basis of the density of their organoid
 cultures and the number of conditions. If multiple C-Tubes are needed, the user should pool all
 barcoded cells before splitting them evenly into each C-Tube to minimize technical variation.
 CRITICAL STEP Fibroblasts and leukocytes can migrate out of the central Matrigel droplet and
 c


 adhere to the plastic bottom of the culture plates in prolonged co-cultures. Scrape each well
 thoroughly to ensure that all cells are recovered.
 14 Dissociate organoids into single cells by using a gentleMACS Octo dissociator and the ‘Standard
 protocol’ (see Equipment setup) (Timing: ~50 min).
 CRITICAL STEP On completion of the program, the user needs to conﬁrm visually that the
 c


 dissociation is sufﬁcient; i.e., very few cell clumps should be visible at this stage. If not, users are
 encouraged to perform an additional round of the ‘Quick protocol’ (see Equipment setup) on the
 gentleMACS Octo dissociator.
 ? TROUBLESHOOTING
 15 After sufﬁcient dissociation, centrifuge the C-Tubes at 800g for 1 min at room temperature to

 19 Resuspend cells in 2 ml of CSB and ﬁlter through a cell strainer to get rid of residual cell clumps.
 CRITICAL STEP We use 35-µm cell strainers to ﬁlter organoid monocultures and 70-µm cell
 c


 strainers for cultures containing large cells such as ﬁbroblasts. Users should choose appropriate cell
 strainers on the basis of the cellular composition of their experimental system.
 20 Count cells by using the Countess II automated cell counter. Up to ~4.5 × 106 cells can be taken

 c


 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Although we commonly use 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 followed by 50%

 buffer (ﬁnal concentration = 125 nM).
 37 Resuspend cells in 1 ml of intercalation buffer, gently vortex and incubate for 1 h on a rocker at
 room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.
 CRITICAL STEP Because the intercalation reaction is non-covalent, cells should be kept at 4 °C in
 c


 the intercalation buffer until ready to proceed to data acquisition (e.g., when the Helios is tuned).
 PAUSE POINT Cells can be stored at 4 °C in the intercalation buffer for ≤2 weeks (with post-

4912 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 16 | OCTOBER 2021 | 4897–4918 | www.nature.com/nprot

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 CRITICAL STEP Different cell types may display distinct abundances of DNA. Users are advised


 c
 to check every experimental condition to ensure that all cell types of interest are included in the
 DNA gating step.
 CRITICAL STEP The cisplatinhigh population contains both dead and dying cells. If cell death is of


 c
 biological interest (e.g., in a drug-screening assay), we suggest users be more lenient with the
 cisplatin gating to include dying cells.
 56 Perform cell-type gating to exclude doublets (i.e., cells positive for mutually exclusive cell-type
 markers) (Fig. 6b).
 57 Export the dataset as FCS ﬁles and proceed to data analysis with CyGNAL.
 CRITICAL STEP The dataset now contains events that are identiﬁed as single cells (Fig. 6b,
 c
 TOBis_n_Cells.fcs).
 58 To preprocess dataset(s) by using CyGNAL, copy the cell-comprised FCS ﬁle(s) to the Raw_Data
 folder within the pipeline folder, run python code/1-data_preprocess.py and follow the
 prompts. This step will generate two outputs: the preprocessed datasets and the ﬁle
 panel_markers.csv containing all the markers used in the experiment. The output ﬁles are
 saved in a folder named by the user-deﬁned analysis identiﬁer within the Preprocessed_Data folder
 (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 6).
 CRITICAL STEP Preprocessing of dataset(s) by 1-data_preprocess.py is prerequisite for the
 c


 subsequent analysis steps and has to be performed as the ﬁrst step of the workﬂow.
 CRITICAL STEP panel_markers.csv is used by downstream scripts to specify the markers of
 c


 interest in a given analysis.
 CRITICAL STEP The input ﬁle formats supported by CyGNAL are standard FCS and tab-
 c


 separated ASCII TXT. Users can choose to save the output as either TXT or FCS ﬁle(s) (stripped of
 original FCS metadata), with the default set to match the input ﬁle format (example ﬁles can be
 accessed at the GitHub repository).

 Dimensionality reduction (UMAP) ● Timing 20–40 min (~1 million cells)
 59 Copy CyGNAL-processed dataset(s) and the corresponding panel_markers.csv to the Analysis/
 UMAP_input/ folder and edit panel_markers.csv by labeling markers used for UMAP calculation
 with ‘Y’ (by default, all markers are labeled with ‘N’).
 60 Run python code/2-umap.py from the pipeline folder and follow the prompts. The original
 dataset updated with UMAP coordinates will be formatted as TXT ﬁle(s) and saved in a folder
 named by the user-deﬁned analysis identiﬁer in Analysis/UMAP_output/ (Fig. 6c and
 Supplementary Fig. 6).
 CRITICAL STEP When performing UMAP analysis on multiple conditions within the same
 c


 experiment, the 2-umap.py script will concatenate all the input ﬁles, calculate UMAP coordinates
 for the concatenated dataset and save the results as separate conditions on the basis of their ﬁle of
 origin. This ensures that all the input ﬁles share a common UMAP embedding to facilitate direct
 comparison between conditions.
 CRITICAL STEP When multiple ﬁles are used for UMAP analysis, users can down-sample all
 c


 input ﬁles to the cell count of the sample with the lowest cell number (details on which cells are
 included for the analysis can be found in the output folder). This yields a more balanced dataset for
 UMAP calculation and visualization and reduces memory requirements and computation time.

 Cell-type and cell-state identiﬁcation ● Timing ~45 min
 61 Import CyGNAL-processed dataset(s) to Cytobank or an equivalent FCS processing
 software (e.g., FlowJo).
 62 Identify different cell types present in the experimental condition(s) on the basis of cell
 type–speciﬁc markers (Fig. 6d).
 CRITICAL STEP To improve the ﬁdelity of cell-type identiﬁcation, at least two markers should be
 c


 used per cell type. Ectopically expressed cell type–speciﬁc ﬂuorescent proteins such as GFP and RFP
 are useful for cell-type identiﬁcation when robust endogenous antigens are unavailable.
 63 For each identiﬁed cell type, perform cell-state analysis based on cell-state markers (Fig. 6e).
 64 Export the cell type– and/or cell state–speciﬁc dataset(s) as FCS or TXT ﬁles for PTM signaling
 network analysis.
 CRITICAL STEP If using Cytobank, uncheck ‘Include header with FCS ﬁlename’ when exporting
 c


 TXT ﬁles and make sure that the dataset(s) is exported as raw values (Cytobank gives users the
 option to export illustration-based transformed data).

PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS

 PTM signaling network analysis ● Timing 20–40 min (dependent on the scale of the
 experiment)
 65 Copy CyGNAL-processed, cell type–speciﬁc dataset(s) and the corresponding panel_markers.csv to
 Analysis/EMD_input/ or Analysis/DREMI_input/ and edit panel_markers.csv by labeling markers
 used for the calculation with ‘Y’ (by default, all markers are labeled with ‘N’).
 66 Run python code/3-emd.py or python code/4-dremi.py and follow the prompts. The
 output will be saved in folders named by the user-deﬁned analysis identiﬁer within Analysis/
 EMD_output/ or Analysis/EMD_output/ accordingly. EMD and DREMI scores can be visualized
 by using heatmaps (Steps 67 and 68) or summarized with PCA (Steps 69 and 70).
 CRITICAL STEP For EMD calculations, the user needs to deﬁne the reference (R) dataset for all
 c
 experimental variables (V) against which to compare. By default, the concatenation of all input ﬁles
 is used as R, but users can also assign a speciﬁc dataset as the reference.
 CRITICAL STEP The choice of R can greatly inﬂuence the interpretation of EMD scores. When
 c


 there is a clear baseline control in a given experiment (e.g., untreated monoculture), that control
 population should be used as R. However, when there is no obvious baseline condition (e.g., when
 comparing PTMs between different cell types within organoids), we advise using a concatenated
 population of all conditions as R (default setting).
 CRITICAL STEP EMD is a non-negative metric quantifying the difference between two
 c


 distributions. In our workﬂow, EMD scores are signed by the difference of a marker’s median
 intensity between V and R to indicate the ‘direction’ of signaling change—positive for up-regulation
 and negative for down-regulation.
 CRITICAL STEP For DREMI calculations, users can perform standard deviation–based outlier
 c


 removal or generate conditional probability plots for each marker combination. Note: these
 optional settings increase computational load.


 Heatmap visualization ● Timing <5 min
 67 To visualize EMD/DREMI scores by using heatmaps, copy the output of EMD/DREMI calculations
 to the Analysis/Vis_Heatmap folder.
 68 Open a terminal from the pipeline folder, run python code/5v1-heatmap.py and perform
 interactive heatmap visualization in the prompted browser window. Once a satisfactory layout has
 been achieved, the heatmaps can be exported as a PNG image or PDF document.


 PCA ● Timing <5 min
 69 To perform PCA, copy the output of EMD/DREMI calculations to the Analysis/Vis_PCA folder.
 70 Run python code/5v2-pca.py and perform interactive heatmap visualization in the
 prompted browser window. Once a satisfactory layout has been achieved, the heatmaps can be
 exported as a PNG image or PDF document. The PCA coordinates with the percentage of variance
 explained by each principal component can be exported separately as a TXT ﬁle.

Anticipated results
 This TOBis MC protocol typically generates >1,000,000 single-cell measurements of ~50 MC
 channels (cell-type identiﬁcation antibodies, cell-state antibodies/probes and PTM antibodies) from
 up to 126 organoid cultures (Fig. 3d). When compared with the starting cell count (i.e., after single-
 cell dissociation), 50–60% of the cells can be acquired by MC, and the sum of TOBis_n_Cells.fcs cell
 counts typically ranges from 50% to 70% of the total debarcoded event count. Previous analysis with
 small intestinal organoids conﬁrmed that cell-type and cell-state recovery was in line with expected
 ratios for small intestinal epithelia17. The standard output ﬁles generated by the workﬂow are for-
 matted as FCS 3.0, which is compatible with third-party cytometry data analysis tools including
 Cytobank and FlowJo, where manual data preprocessing, cell-type identiﬁcation and cell-state

 classiﬁcation can be performed. We do not routinely perform compensation58 or batch correction59
 on TOBis MC data, but such strategies could be useful for some users. Single-cell data can be
 visualized by using UMAP50 via CyGNAL (or t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding)60/
 PHATE (potential of heat diffusion for afﬁnity-based trajectory embedding)61 by using standalone
 scripts), and cell type–speciﬁc organoid PTM network analysis is performed with EMD51,52 (node)
 and DREMI53 (edge) scoring. EMD and DREMI scores output to .csv format and can be easily
 visualized by using heatmaps and PCA. The cell type–speciﬁc results generated by this TOBis MC
 protocol can be used to quantitively compare cell states and PTM signaling networks between
 organoids and organoid co-cultures.

in reporting. For further information on Nature Research policies, see our Editorial Policies and the Editorial Policy Checklist.


Statistics
For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.
n/a Confirmed
 The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement
 A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly
 The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided
 Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.

 A description of all covariates tested
 A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons
 A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient)
 AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)

 For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted
 Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.

 For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings
 For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes
 Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated
 Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.

Life sciences study design
All studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.
 Sample size No sample size calculation was performed as this is a method development and proof-of-concept project. Sample size was determined based
 on the experience and expertise of the investigators.

 Data exclusions All cells were gated for Gaussian discrimination parameters (Event length, Centre, Residual, and Width values) as recommended by Fluidigm
 to remove non-events such as debris and doublets. The cell-gating strategy was described in Figure 6.

 Replication Multiple cohorts of murine and patient-derive organoids were used in this project, yielding comparable results and thereby validated the
 robustness of our methods. Details on technical/biological replications of experiments are included in relevant figure legends.

 Randomization Animals and organoid samples were randomly chosen for inclusion in this study.

 Blinding No conditions presented in this study required blinding.
