Procedure
 1 Remove as much cell culture medium from the cultures as possible, taking care not to disturb the organoids.
 2 Add 500 µl of pre-chilled Cell Recovery solution.
 3 Pipette up and down gently by using wide-bore tips to carefully break up the Matrigel matrix without damaging the organoids and collect the
 organoids into a 15-ml conical tube.
 4 Incubate the cultures with Cell Recovery solution at 4 °C for 20 min.
 5 Centrifuge the cultures at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C, remove the Cell Recovery solution and repeat steps 2–5.
 6 Visualize the organoids under the microscope to conﬁrm that the Matrigel has been fully depolymerased and that organoids are ﬂoating free
 from the Matrigel. If organoids appear free from the Matrigel, centrifuge the cultures at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C to separate the structures
 from the solution. Remove the Cell Recovery solution.
 7 Add 5 ml of cold DPBS to the tube and gently pipette up and down to wash the Matrigel from the organoids.
 8 Spin down the conical tube at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C.
 9 Gently aspirate the DPBS.
10 Wash a second time with 5 ml of DPBS and spin down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C.
 11 After aspirating DPBS, ﬁx the organoids in 1 ml of 4% (wt/vol) PFA at 4 °C overnight.
12 Spin down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min. Remove the PFA solution and dispose of properly.
 13 Treat the ﬁxed samples with 500 µl of 4% (wt/vol) PFA with 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 at room temperature for 15 min.
14 Spin down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min. Remove the PFA/Triton X-100 solution and dispose of properly.
15 Add 5 ml of DPBS to the tube to suspend, and spin down the conical tube at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C.
16 Gently aspirate the DPBS.
17 Wash a second time with 5 ml of DPBS, spin down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C and gently aspirate the DPBS.
18 Add 1 ml of permeabilization buffer (0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20/DPBS) to the tube and transfer the organoids in solution to a 1.5-ml centrifuge
 tube. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature.
19 After gently removing the permeabilization buffer, add 1 ml of blocking buffer (1% (wt/vol) BSA and 0.3% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in DPBS) and
 leave for 1 h at room temperature.
20 Prepare the primary antibody mixture in blocking buffer. Perform a spin-down at 1,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 4 °C and aspirate off the blocking
 buffer. Add the primary antibody mixture and incubate overnight at 4 oC.
21 Aspirate the primary antibody mixture and perform three washes with 1 ml of DPBS, spinning down and aspirating the DPBS each time.
22 Prepare the secondary antibody mixture in blocking buffer. Add this mixture to the tube with the organoids and leave at room temperature for
 2 h or overnight at 4 oC.
23 Wash three times with 1 ml of DPBS, spinning down and aspirating the PBS each time.
24 Add 50 μl of DPBS to each tube of organoids and transfer to one well of an IBIDI glass slide. Add one drop of DAPI mounting medium per well.
 Gently tilt the slide side to side to mix the DAPI mixture.

 efﬁciency of HBPO formation. SOX2 should be expressed in anterior gut spheroids, CDX2 should
 be expressed in posterior gut spheroids and PDX1 should be expressed at the boundary after day 11.
 An example of optimal results is shown in Fig. 3b–d.


 HBPO culture (day 9) ● Timing 2–3 h
 41 On day 9, embed A–P spheroids in Matrigel drops and culture in gut growth medium to generate
 multi-organ HBPOs (Fig. 3c). Maintain the spheroid cultures at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2,
 95% air and replace the gut growth medium every 4 d.
 42 Pick up a fused A-P spheroid by using a mechanical pipette with a wide-bore 200-µl tip and place
 the spheroid into a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube.
 43 Spin down and carefully remove the supernatant with a regular sterile ﬁlter pipette tip.
 CRITICAL Organoids may be visible but be difﬁcult to see; a dissecting microscope will help with
 c


 visibility and handling.
 44 Add 20–30 µl/well of 100% Matrigel (Phenol Red–Free) on ice to the fused A-P spheroid in a 1.5-ml
 tube. Gently re-suspend the single A-P spheroid by using a mechanical pipette with a wide-bore
 200-µl tip and slowly plate it on a 24-well tissue culture plate (VWR International) to make a
 Matrigel drop.
 CRITICAL To avoid solidiﬁcation of Matrigel, this step should be performed quickly. The tissue
 c


 culture plate does not need to be on ice.

 45 Incubate the drop in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 5 min.
 46 Flip the plate upside down and incubate for a further 5 min to prevent the spheroid from attaching
 to the bottom.
 47 Add enough gut growth medium to cover the entire drop and culture for 4 d to generate HBPOs.
 Cultures for spheroids should be maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air, and the
 gut growth medium should be replaced every 4 d.

 Air–liquid interface culture (day 13) (Optional) ● Timing 20–80 d
 CRITICAL For longer- term culture, HBPOs can be transferred to six-well Transwells for air–liquid
 c

 interface culture at day 13.
 48 Aspirate the medium from the well. Using a mechanical pipette with a wide-bore 200-µl tip, pick up
 the entire Matrigel drop with embedded HBPO. The Matrigel-embedded HBPO should dissociate
 easily from the bottom of the well.
 49 (Optional) If using an HBP anlage speciﬁc reporter line (such as a PROX1 reporter) before
 transferring to Transwells, perform dissection of the boundary region of the HBPO to increase
 epithelial bifurcation rate. Transfer the HBPO to a spot plate containing DPBS placed on a
 ﬂuorescent microscope. Using two clean micro knives in either hand, carefully dissect the HBPO by
 studying the ﬂuorescent activity under the microscope. Using a Pasteur pipette, pick up the
 dissected HBPO.
 50 Transfer the (dissected or undissected) HBPO to a six-well Transwell. Add one HBPO
 per Transwell.
 51 Add 10 µl of fresh pre-chilled 100% Matrigel over the organoid to cover it.
 52 Incubate the organoid in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 3 min.
 53 Carefully add 500 µl–1 ml of gut growth medium to the bottom of the Transwell.
 CRITICAL For air-liquid interface culture, do not wet the upper side of the Transwell membrane.

 54 Maintain organoid cultures at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air and replace the
 gut growth medium every 2 d. The HBPO on the Transwell can be cultured for ≤50 d
 without passaging.
 CRITICAL Do not wet the upper side of the Transwell membrane during medium exchange.

 Steps 16–19, change mTeSR medium: 1 d

 Steps 37–40, anterior-posterior boundary spheroid formation: 1 d
 Steps 41–47, HBPO culture: 4 d (20–80 d for long-term culture)
 Steps 48–54, (optional) air–liquid interface culture: 20–80 d


Anticipated results
 The boundary interactions between anterior and posterior gut spheroids that have been differentiated
 from PSCs enable autonomous emergence of HBP organ domains speciﬁed at the foregut-midgut
 boundary in the absence of any added extrinsic factors. Deﬁnitive endoderm differentiation (step 30;
 day 3; Fig. 2b–d)) yields a population of cells over 70% pure by SOX17 and FOXA2 double-positive
 staining (Fig. 2c)4,28,35. During the gut cell induction (Steps 31 and 32; days 3–7), 3D structures
 gradually form in a highly reproducible manner in various lines of PSCs (Fig. 2h). At day 7 (Step 33),
 we separately dissociate anterior gut cells and posterior gut cells to reaggregate them in low-
 attachment 96-well round-bottom plates. At day 8, SOX2 positive (~80%) anterior and CDX2 positive
 (~80%) posterior gut spheroids should form, and this can be conﬁrmed by whole-mount immu-
 nostaining as in Fig. 3b and FACS12. After mixing each gut spheroid in a low-attachment, 96-well
 round-bottom plate, fused spheroids form with a high rate of reproducibility12. At day 9, PDX1 or
 PROX1 expression is not observed; however, during polarization culture in Matrigel, both proteins
 began to be expressed at the boundary domain of the fused spheroids (Fig. 3d). We ﬁnd that
 morphogenesis continues in these PDX1 and PROX1 positive domains, which form a branching
 structure called an HBPO (Fig. 4a,b). The efﬁciency of HBPO production was increased approxi-
 mately two-fold by air–liquid interface culture in our validation study12. Time-course imaging shows
 that the PROX1 positive epithelium in the HBPO starts to invaginate and grow outward in multiple
 directions, progressively forming a branching structure around day 23 (Fig. 4c). Immunoﬂuorescent
 staining with the liver markers alpha fetoprotein (AFP), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A)
 and albumin, the pancreatic marker PDX1 and the bile duct marker DBA conﬁrms that each lineage
