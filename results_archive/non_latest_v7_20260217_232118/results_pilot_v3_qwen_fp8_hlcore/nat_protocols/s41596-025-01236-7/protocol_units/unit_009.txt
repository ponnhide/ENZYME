Protocol


FGF2 (100 μg ml−1 stock)
Resuspend lyophilized FGF2 (1 mg) in 10 ml of 5 mM Tris supplemented with 0.1% (vol/vol) FBS to
make a stock solution of 100 μg ml−1. Dispense as 50-μl aliquots into microcentrifuge tubes and
store at −80 °C for ≤12 months.

FGF9 (100 μg ml−1 stock)
Resuspend lyophilized FGF9 (25 µg) in 250 μl of sterile PBS supplemented with 0.1% (vol/vol)
FBS to make a stock solution of 100 μg ml−1. Dispense as 15-μl aliquots into microcentrifuge
tubes and store at −80 °C for ≤12 months.

Heparin (1 mg ml−1 stock)
Reconstitute heparin powder with ultrapure water and filter sterilize by using a
polyethersulfone (PES) 0.22-μm syringe-driven filter unit. Distribute 1-ml aliquots into
microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80 °C for ≤2 years.

Human insulin (10 mg ml−1 stock)
Resuspend lyophilized human insulin (100 mg) in 10 ml of 5 mM HCl to make a stock
solution of 10 mg ml−1 and then store it overnight at 4 °C. On the second day, put it in a water
bath to completely dissolve it, then prepare 250-μl aliquots and store them at −80 °C for
≤12 months.

LDN193189 (200 μM stock)
Add 2.46 ml of DMSO to 5 mg of LDN193189 powder to make a 5 mM stock solution (first stock).
Make 100-μl aliquots in microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80 °C for ≤12 months. 100 μl of
5 mM stock solution is added to 2.4 ml of DMSO to make a 200 μM stock solution (second stock).
Dispense as 100-μl aliquots of second LDN193189 stock into microcentrifuge tubes and store at
−20 °C for ≤6 months.

SB202190 (50 mM stock)
Add 604 µl of DMSO to 10 mg of SB202190 powder to make a 50 mM stock solution. Dispense
as 10-μl aliquots of SB202190 stock into microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80 °C for
≤12 months.

Sodium selenite (50 μg ml−1)
Add 10 ml of ultrapure water to 500 mg of sodium selenite powder to make a 50 mg ml−1 stock
solution (first stock). Make 100-μl aliquots in microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80 °C for
≤2–3 years. 10 μl of 50 mg ml−1 stock solution is added to 10 ml of ultrapure water to make
a 50 µg ml−1 stock solution (second stock). Dispense as 250-μl aliquots of second sodium
selenite stock into microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80 °C for ≤12 months.

Transferrin, apo-, human plasma (5.5 mg ml−1 stock)
Resuspend the whole bottle of lyophilized transferrin (100 mg) in 1 ml of ultrapure water
before transferring to a 50-ml Falcon tube with another 17.182 ml of ultrapure water
(in total 18.182 ml of water) to make a 5.5 mg ml−1 stock solution. Prepare 250-μl aliquots
of transferrin stock and store at −80 °C for ≤12 months.

TRULI/LATS-IN-1 (10 mM stock)
Add 2.99 ml of DMSO to 10 mg of TRULI powder to make a 10 mM stock solution.
Prepare 15-μl aliquots of TRULI stock into microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80 °C
for ≤12 months.

Y27632 (ROCKi; 10 mM stock)
Add 3.123 ml of ultrapure water to 10 mg of Y27632 powder to make a 10 mM stock.
Prepare 100-μl aliquots into microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80 °C for ≤12 months.
