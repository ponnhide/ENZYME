For each cell type, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) as well as the detection rate across clusters. For each cell type, a score was computed by multiplying the maximum AUROC with the maximum detection rate among its marker genes. Each cluster was then assigned to the cell type with the highest score.
