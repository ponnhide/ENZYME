Organoids were induced to differentiate by directly changing the culture media to differentiation media. The differentiation protocols are as follows: Paneth cells. EGF (50 ng/mL), IGF-I (100 ng/mL), FGF-2 (50 ng/mL), DMH1 (2 μM), R-spondin1 CM (10%), Gastrin I (10 nM), A83-01 (0.5 μM), CHIR (4 μM), DAPT (10 μM), pVc (100 μg/mL) and IL-22 (2 ng/mL). Culture for 3 days.
