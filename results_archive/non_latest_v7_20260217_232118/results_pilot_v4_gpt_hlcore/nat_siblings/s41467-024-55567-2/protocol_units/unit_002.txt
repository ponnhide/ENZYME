Two LGR5-targeting sgRNAs were cloned into SpCas9-equipped HP180 plasmids (a gift from Hui Yang lab), generating LGR5 sgRNA plasmids. HDR templates were made by replacing the CMV promoter in pBluescript II SK (+) (Addgene, #212205) with LGR5-P2AmNeonGreen sequence flanked by LGR5 homology arms using the Fast-Fusion™ Cloning Kit (GeneCopoeia).
