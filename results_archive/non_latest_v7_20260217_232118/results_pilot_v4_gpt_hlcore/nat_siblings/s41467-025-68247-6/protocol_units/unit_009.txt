FITC-Dextran (MedChemExpress) diluted to 2 mg/mL in PBS for 5 min in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 30 min, after which organoid growth media with 10 µM Y-27632 was added. Media was changed every other day to organoid growth media. Organoids were then imaged on a Nikon spinning disc confocal to collect fluorescence and DIC images, and the percentage of intact organoids was calculated as the number of organoids per condition/donor that excluded FITC-dextran from the lumen divided by the total number of organoids.
