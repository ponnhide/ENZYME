Sample-specific sequencing libraries were prepared from the extracted genomic DNA of each collected sample by amplifying and barcoding the lentivirally integrated sgRNA spacer sequence using the Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase (Agilent, catalogue no. 600679). Samples were pooled and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 550 flow cells at 450–1,000 times read depth.
