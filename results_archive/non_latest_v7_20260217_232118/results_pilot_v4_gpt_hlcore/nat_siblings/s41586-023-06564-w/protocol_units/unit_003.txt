To generate 3D hCO, hiPS cells were dissociated with accutase to obtain a single-cell suspension. About 3 × 10^6 cells were seeded per AggreWell 800 plate well in Essential 8 medium supplemented with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (10 µM). The plate was centrifuged at 100 g for 3 min and incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The next day (day 0), cellular aggregates were transferred into ultra-low attachment plastic dishes (Corning, catalogue no. 3262) and cultured in Essential 6 medium supplemented with dorsomorphin (2.5 µM, Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. P5499), SB-431542 (10 µM, R&D Systems, catalogue no. 1614) and XAV-939 (1.25 µM, Tocris, catalogue no. 3748).
