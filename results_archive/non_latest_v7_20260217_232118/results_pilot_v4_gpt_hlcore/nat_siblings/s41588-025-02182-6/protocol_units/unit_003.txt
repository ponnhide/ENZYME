We assessed 12 different data-integration methods using the proportion of cell types in each organoid sample and compared the similarity of each cell type with counterparts in adult and fetal tisand selected scPoli20,22 to generate an integrated embedding of all orga- noid cells, enabling a cohesive representation of the diverse data (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1e).
