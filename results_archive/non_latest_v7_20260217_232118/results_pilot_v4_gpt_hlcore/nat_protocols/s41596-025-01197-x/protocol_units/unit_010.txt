(i) Fixation: transfer organoids to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube using a P200 pipette tip cut to avoid damaging the organoids.
Let organoids settle to the bottom, aspirate the medium and rinse once with sterile PBS. Carefully remove PBS without collecting organoids.
(ii) Discard the supernatant, add 250 µL of 4% PFA and incubate overnight at 4 °C. ▲ CAUTION Work with PFA inside a chemical safety cabinet.
(iii) Sucrose gradient: the next day, discard the PFA supernatant and wash the organoids twice with 1 mL of PBS, allowing the organoids to settle to the bottom of the tube between washes. Aspirate PBS carefully to avoid removing organoids.
Sequentially add and remove 1 mL of 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose solutions, allowing organoids to settle to the bottom between each step (30–40 min per step). Discard the supernatant after each step.
(iv) OCT embedding: transfer organoids to a cryosection mold, remove residual sucrose solution and slowly fill the mold with OCT, avoiding bubbles. Position organoids in the center of the mold using a P20 pipette tip.
(v) Flash freeze the mold containing OCT and organoids by placing it on dry ice. ■ PAUSE POINT Store the mold at −80 °C until cryosectioning.
(vi) Cryosectioning: use a cryostat to cut 15–20‑µm‑thick sections and place them onto positively charged microscope slides. Use an anti‑fold tool to prevent section folding. ▲ CRITICAL STEP Make sure microscope slides have a positively charged coating for tissue adhesion.
(vii) Store the slides with sections at −20 °C until used for immunohistochemistry.
(viii) Immunohistochemistry: defrost slides containing tissue sections with a lumen at room temperature for 10 min.
(ix) Wash the slides with 0.1 M glycine in PBS.
(x) Block the sections with 3% BSA and 0.3% Triton‑X 100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature.
(xi) Dilute primary antibodies in 3% BSA with 0.3% Triton‑X 100 in PBS. Cover the sections and incubate overnight at 4 °C in a humidifying chamber.
(xii) The next day, wash the sections with PBS for 15 min at room temperature.
(xiii) Dilute secondary antibodies in 3% BSA with 0.3% Triton‑X 100 in PBS and incubate in darkness for 1–2 h at room temperature.
(xiv) Wash the sections three times with PBS.
(xv) Mount coverslips using Aqua Poly Mounting Media, avoiding bubbles.
(xvi) Allow the slides to air dry at room temperature in darkness for 10 min. ■ PAUSE POINT Slides can be stored for up to 1 year at −20 °C until imaging.
