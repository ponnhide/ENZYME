Warm a 6-well plate with MG-coated wells by placing it in a 37 °C, 5% CO₂ incubator for ~30 min or keeping it at room temperature for 1 h in a biosafety cabinet.
Aliquot 6 mL of E8 medium and 3 mL of stem cell medium per a frozen vial of PS cells into separate 15 mL Falcon tubes. Warm medium aliquots to 37 °C and add 3 µL of Y‑27632 (1:1,000) to stem cell medium.
Take a frozen aliquot of cells from liquid nitrogen and thaw the aliquot by dipping it in a 37 °C water bath while monitoring the process every few seconds.
As the vial of cells starts thawing take the aliquot to the biosafety cabinet after thoroughly spraying it with 70% ethanol and wiping it with a napkin.
Using a 5 mL serological pipet, draw 6 mL of E8 medium into the pipet. Then, collect the medium containing the thawed cells in the same pipet. Very slowly transfer the pipet content (6 mL of E8 medium and ~1 mL of medium containing thawed cells) into a 15 mL conical tube.
Spin cells down at 1,000 rpm (300 g) for 4 min at room temperature.
Bring the conical tube with cells into the biosafety cabinet and carefully aspirate the supernatant, with care to avoid disrupting the cell pellet.
Add 3 mL of stem cell medium with Y‑27632 and gently resuspend the pellet using the 5 mL serological pipet to pipet the solution up and down ~5 times.
Aspirate (or collect) MG from the coated wells and add 3 mL of the cell suspension per well.
Place the plate in the incubator. Then, move it back‑to‑forth and left‑to‑right a few times to evenly spread the cells over the entire surface. Do not move the plate after this.
