For each well to be passaged, warm up three 35 mm dishes containing MG by placing them in the biosafety cabinet for ~30 min.
Aspirate neural induction medium and add 1 mL dispase per well. Incubate the plate at 37 °C. Begin monitoring cell detachment under a microscope after 5 min of incubation. Some lines may already be detached after 5 min; it takes 15–20 min for most PS cell lines. Once the sheet of cells is detached, carefully transfer it into a 15 mL conical tube using a 5 mL serological pipet.
Let the cell clump settle to the bottom of the tube by gravity (1–2 min). Carefully remove the supernatant using a 1 mL pipet.
Wash it three times using 3 mL N2/B27 medium. During each washing step, dislodge the clump from the bottom of the tube with medium while carefully avoiding breaking it into pieces.
After the last wash, add 4 mL amplification medium and gently triturate (~5 times) the clump of cells using a 5 mL pipette to break it into small clumps of cells that are ~750 µm by 750 µm in size. Check the size under the microscope.
Replate the resultant clumps of cell at low density to promote NR formation. We usually replate one well into three or four 35 mm dishes. Adjust the total volume with amplification medium to 12 mL (three dishes) or 16 mL (four dishes) and split the volume between the MG‑coated dishes.
Place the dishes with cell clusters in an incubator and move them back‑and‑forth and side‑to‑side to evenly distribute clusters over the entire surface.
Change the medium every other day (two medium changes total, on days 2 and 4 post‑replating) by aspirating ~50% of the old medium and adding 2 mL of fresh amplification medium with 2× concentrations of FGF2 and EGF to achieve final FGF2 and EGF concentrations of ~10 ng/mL. The clusters of NRs should begin emerging after two medium changes or 5–6 d post‑replating.
On day 6 post‑replating, prepare a glass hook (see ‘Equipment setup’) by spraying it with 70% ethanol to sterilize before using it for SNR isolation.
Using a stereoscope positioned in a dissection biosafety cabinet, identify NR clusters (Fig. 2d) and SNRs (Fig. 2e) for manual isolation.
