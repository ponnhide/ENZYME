41. Dispense 250 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose into each of the four remaining FACS tubes.
 ▲ Critical step If using cells rather than beads as controls, add at least 10,000 cells per
 tube in HBSS/BSA/glucose.
42. Add 2.5 µL of a single antibody to each single-color control tube into the FACS tubes
 containing 250 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.
43. For the live/dead stain, add 1.25 µL of DAPI into the FACS tubes containing 250 µL
 of combined buffer/cell rinse. One tube will be unstained.
 FACS tube Ab/stain Dilution Buffer volume Ab/stain volume
 1 DAPI 1:200 250 µL 1.25 μL
 2 CD45 PE–Cy7 1:100 250 µL 2.5 μL
 3 CD146 PE 1:100 250 µL 2.5 μL
 4 ANPEP APC 1:100 250 µL 2.5 μL
 5 CD31 FITC 1:100 250 µL 2.5 μL
 6 Unstained NA 250 µL NA
44. After adding antibodies as explained in Step 43, shake the UltraComp eBead
 vial and add one drop of beads to each single-color control with the ‘Ready to Use’
 bottle. Please note, beads are designed to bind antibodies and eliminate the need
 to use cells for many controls. Therefore, do not add beads to DAPI and unstained
 controls. If cells are being used for all controls, then do not add beads to any of
 the controls.
45. Seal the tubes and place on ice.
