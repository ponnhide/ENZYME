32. Day 0. If continuing after FACS (Step 31A or C), count the cells with a TC20 automated cell counter and seed ~120,000 cells per well to one Matrigel‑coated well of a 12‑well plate with 1 ml of hNPSR‑v2 medium.
33. Return the cultures to the incubator. Typically, it takes 4 d for each sorted iNPC passage cycle at the split ratio of 1:10.
34. Day 1. Observe iNPCs under the microscope to ensure that the cells are attached to the plate.
35. Day 2. Change the medium to 1 ml of fresh hNPSR‑v2 medium.
36. Day 4. Observe iNPCs under the microscope to check confluence. iNPCs should have reached 80–90% confluence and will be ready for passaging or cryopreservation.
