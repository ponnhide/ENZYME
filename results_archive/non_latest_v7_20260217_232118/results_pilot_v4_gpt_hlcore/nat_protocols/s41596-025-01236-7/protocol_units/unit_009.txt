53. Day −1. After dissociation to single cells (Steps 37–39), count the cells by using the TC20 automated cell counter.
54. Centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with an appropriate volume of hNPSR‑v2 medium so that each 100 µl of medium contains 25,000–30,000 iNPCs.
55. Seed ~25,000–30,000 iNPCs into one well of a 96‑well U‑bottom low‑attachment plate in 100 µl of hNPSR‑v2 medium and then centrifuge the plate at 300 g for 5 min.
56. After centrifugation, place the plate in the incubator to allow the cells to aggregate overnight.
57. Day 0. The iNPC aggregates are transferred to the membrane of a Transwell for air–liquid interface culture.
