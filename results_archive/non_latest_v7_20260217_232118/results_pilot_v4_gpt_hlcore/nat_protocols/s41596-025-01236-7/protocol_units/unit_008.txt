42. 200,000–1,000,000 cells can be frozen in 0.5 ml of Bambanker cell freezing medium per cryovial (1.5‑ml Nalgene SYSTEM 100 cryogenic vial). To do so, after Step 39, first count the total number of cells harvested.
43. Then, calculate the number of cryovials needed on the basis of the total number of cells. Centrifuge the cells at 300 g for 5 min, resuspend the cell pellet with an appropriate volume of Bambanker cell freezing medium and distribute a 0.5‑ml aliquot of the cell suspension in each cryovial.
