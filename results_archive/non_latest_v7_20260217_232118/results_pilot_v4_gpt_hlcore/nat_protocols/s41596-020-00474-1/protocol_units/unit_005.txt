We discuss three different methods for genetically modifying breast organoids, including Lipofectamine 2000 for transient transfection with moderate-to-high efﬁciency (Step 65A), electroporation for transient transfection with high efﬁciency (Step 65B; used for Fig. S4 of ref. 7) or lentiviral transduction (Step 65C).
