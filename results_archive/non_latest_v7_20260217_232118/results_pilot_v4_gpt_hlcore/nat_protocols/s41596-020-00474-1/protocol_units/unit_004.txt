34 Resuspend the pellet in an appropriate amount of BME. As a guideline, 200 µl is sufﬁcient for a pellet of ~50 µl. The amount of BME to add scales linearly with the pellet volume.
35 Plate 100 µl of BME-containing cells in multiple small drops (<20 µl each) per well in a 12-well plate (Fig. 2e). When tissue yield is limited, plating can be scaled down to 24-well format by adapting all volumes accordingly (Table 3).
36 Turn the plate upside down and leave in the biosafety cabinet for 5 min.
37 Transfer the plate, upside down, into a 37 °C incubator and leave to solidify for 30 min.
38 Add 750 µl of pre-warmed (RT to 37 °C) Type 1 or Type 2 medium to each well and transfer to an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.
