Organoid isolation from tissue ● Timing 1.5–5 h
11 Mince the remaining tissue into smaller pieces (0.5–1 mm3) with two scalpels as stated in Step 6, until the tissue mass looks uniform and appears somewhat viscous.
12 Add 5 ml of D-BSA into the glass Petri dish and transfer the minced tissue to a 50-ml Falcon tube using a 5-ml sterile serological pipette pre-wetted with D-BSA. Wash the same glass Petri dish with 5 ml of D-BSA and collect residual minced tissue into the same 50-ml Falcon tube.
13 Add 35 ml of D-BSA to the 50-ml Falcon tube and use a 10-ml sterile serological pipette pre-wetted with D-BSA to resuspend the minced tissue by pipetting up and down ﬁve times.
14 Let the tissue sediment by gravity for 2–3 min, until all tissue pieces are at the bottom of the tube, before aspirating all but 10 ml of D-BSA.
15 Repeat Steps 13 and 14 two more times to wash away potential microorganisms, cell types not contributing to the establishment of organoids, such as blood cells, and dead cells and debris.
16 Aspirate all supernatant carefully, so that only the sedimented tissue pellet remains, and add 10 ml of Type 1 medium.
17 Add 500 µl of collagenase (20 mg/ml stock, ﬁnal concentration 1 mg/ml) and 10 µl of ROCK inhibitor (10 mM stock, ﬁnal concentration 10 µM) to the 50-ml Falcon tube containing the minced tissue.
18 Wrap the 50-ml Falcon tube with Paraﬁlm and place the tube at a slight angle (~15°) on top of an orbital shaker located inside a heated incubator oven at 37 °C. Set the orbital shaker at 140 r.p.m. and digest the tissue for 1–2 h.
