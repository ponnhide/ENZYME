1 Fix the required number of OVB organoids by immersing them in 3–4 ml of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1.8% sucrose in PBS (pH 7.2), overnight at 4 °C
CRITICAL STEP Ensure pH is adjusted to 7.2 to diminish fixation artifacts.
2 Rinse the samples five times in 5 ml of PBS (15 min each).
CRITICAL STEP This washing step is critical to remove all traces of fixative, as glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide (to be used in the next step) form an intermediate compound that can break down to osmium black, a precipitate that can compromise the quality of the sample.
3 Wash the samples twice in distilled water and post‑fix in 1% aqueous solution of osmium tetroxide for 1–2 h at 4 °C.
CRITICAL STEP Avoid longer exposures to osmium tetroxide as this may extract cytoplasmic components.
4 Dehydrate the OVB organoids in a graded series of EtOH (50%, 75%, 95% and absolute), incubating them two times, 15 min each.
5 After dehydration, incubate the samples for 15 min in 5 ml of the intermediate solvent propylene oxide since EtOH and the embedding medium are not fully miscible.
6 First, incubate the organoids in 5 ml of a mixture of propylene oxide and embedding resin (Epon‑Araldite) (propylene oxide 2:1 resin) for 30 min at RT.
7 Agitate the samples very slowly on a wheel rotator and then put overnight at 4 °C in 5 ml of a mixture of propylene oxide and resin 1:1.
8 Transfer the samples in a pure embedding resin overnight at 4 °C.
9 Transfer the organoids to flat embedding molds from the embedding medium and properly orient to maximize cutting the desired area.
10 Leave to polymerize for 48 h at 60–62 °C, and then cut the block with a razor blade to remove the resin around the sample and create a small trapezoidal block.
11 Perform ultrathin sections of uniform thickness of 400–500 nm using a Reichert ultramicrotome and collect the sections on a single hole formvar‑coated copper grids for observing serial sections.
12 To counter stain the sections, transfer the grids into a 2% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate drop in a 70% methanol solution for 7 min or 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water for 20 min.
13 Wash the grids in four drops of 70% methanol followed by five drops of distilled water.
14 Transfer the grids to a drop of Reynold’s lead citrate for 2–3 min.
15 Wash the grids in five drops of distilled water and dry at RT.
