1 Collect up to three OVB organoids of the same batch in a sterile RNase‑free 1.5 ml tube. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for transferring organoids.
2 Remove any carried‑over medium carefully with a 200 µl micropipette tip without disturbing the organoids.
3 Wash organoids once with cold PBS and withdraw PBS.
4 Add 300 µl Tri‑Reagent and incubate at RT for 5 min.
5 Vortex tube three times for 5 s.
6 Incubate the tube at RT for 5 min without agitation.
7 Vortex tube three times for 5 s.
8 Keep the tube on ice for 10 min.
9 Vortex tube three times for 5 s.
10 Keep the tube on ice for 10 min.
11 Freeze organoids by a snap freeze on dry ice and store them at −80 °C overnight.
PAUSE POINT Store organoids in Tri‑Reagent at −80 °C for up to 6 months.
12 Thaw organoids in Tri‑reagent at RT.
13 Vortex the tube times for 5 s.
14 Pipette remaining cell clumps up and down for complete dissociation with 200 µl micropipette tips (filtered, RNase‑free tip).
15 Perform phenol/chloroform extraction to separate nucleic acids from lipids and proteins. Extract RNA with a commercially available RNA extraction kit.
