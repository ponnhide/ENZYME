1 Prepare a Matrigel‑coated dish as described in ‘Reagent setup’. Usually, we culture iPSCs in 60 mm dishes, due to the size/growth area and amount of cells we have frozen per cryovial.
2 Thaw a vial of human iPSCs of the desired genotype quickly in a 37 °C water bath and transfer them into a 15 ml Falcon tube containing 10 mL DMEM/F12 prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath, using a 1 or 2 ml serological pipette.
3 Centrifuge at 700g for 3 min at RT to pellet the cells. Meanwhile, take a Matrigel‑coated dish, aspirate Matrigel solution and replace it with 3 ml mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 μM Rock inhibitor (Y‑27632).
4 Carefully aspirate the supernatant from the cell pellet and resuspend the cells in 1 ml mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 μM Rock inhibitor by using a 1 or 2 ml serological pipette or a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip (use sterile scissors to cut the tip).
5 Transfer the cells into the prepared Matrigel‑coated dish containing mTeSR1 and Rock inhibitor and distribute cells by adding them dropwise over the whole area/dish. Ensure an even distribution by moving the dish back and forth and in a left and right motion.
6 Immediately place cells in a 37 °C incubator at 5% (vol/vol) CO2 as iPSCs will settle and attach to Matrigel within the next 15 min. Do not move the dish for the next 24 h. Then perform daily medium changes.
7 Culture the cells until ~90% confluency. Typically, it takes ~7 d after thawing to reach confluency of 90%.
