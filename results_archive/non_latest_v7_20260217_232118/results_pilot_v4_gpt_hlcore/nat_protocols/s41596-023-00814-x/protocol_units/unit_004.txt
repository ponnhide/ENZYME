9 Fill glass capillary tip with 3 µl of CTB‑488 dilution (front fill) and move the needle tip forward in front of the first pigmented area. Inject the solution into the first OV carefully, using a microscope. Try not to injure the OV or the surrounding tissue and avoid making air bubbles.
10 Move the microinjector tip backward and replace the tip with a new thin glass tip.
CRITICAL STEP Add one drop of OVB medium on the organoid to prevent it from drying out.
11 Fill glass pipette tip with 3 µl of CTB‑647 dilution and repeat step 8 with the second pigmented area.
12 Transfer the injected organoids into a well of a 24‑well plate for suspension culture and expose the plate to normal room light for 10 min.
13 After light exposure, culture the plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.
