1 Collect up to three OVB organoids from day 30 or day 60 in a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for transferring organoids.
2 Remove any carried‑over medium carefully with a 200 µl micropipette tip without disturbing the organoids.
3 Wash organoids three times with 3 ml of PBS and withdraw the PBS.
4 Add 2 ml of Accutase containing 0.2 U/µl DNase I (prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath), close the tube tightly and incubate at 37 °C in a water bath.
CRITICAL STEP Dissociation of organoids to single cells causes cell stress and cell death.
5 Check after 15 min for dissociation of organoids by shaking the tube and watching the integrity of organoids. Place the tube under a sterile hood and dissociate organoids by pipetting up and down with an uncut 1,000 µl micropipette tip.
6 Place the tube back into a water bath and incubate for another 15 min at 37 °C.
7 Repeat step 5.
8 Place tube back and incubate for another 15 min at 37 °C. Do not exceed 45 min of Accutase treatment in total, since this would lead to too high a portion of dead cells and might decrease the success of the further procedure.
9 Stop Accutase treatment by adding 8 ml DMEM/F12, prewarmed in a 37 °C waterbath.
10 Filter the suspension through a sterile 70 µm diameter strainer to remove not dissociated connective tissue and create a purely single‑cell suspension.
11 Centrifuge cells at 500g for 5 min at RT.
12 Aspirate medium and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of OVB organoid medium and count the cells. Perform Trypan‑blue staining. It is recommended to obtain 65–95% cell viability to continue with the procedure.
