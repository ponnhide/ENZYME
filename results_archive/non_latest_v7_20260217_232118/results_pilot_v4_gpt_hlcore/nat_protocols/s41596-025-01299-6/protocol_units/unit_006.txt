Day 1: dislodging neural spheroids from the AggreWell plate
● TIMING 3 h
19. Pre-warm DMEM/F-12 and E6 medium at room temperature for 30 min to 1 h before
 dislodging.
20. Place a 40-μm strainer on top of a 50-ml conical tube and wet the filter with 2 ml of
 DMEM/F-12 (Supplementary Fig. 1).
21. Dislodge neural spheroids from the microwells (Fig. 3b) by gently pipetting the medium
 in the well up and down two to three times with a P1000 pipette by using a 1,000-μl pipette
 tip with wide orifice (1.5 mm) to avoid disturbing the newly formed spheroids.
22. Pass the suspended neural spheroids through the strainer. The neural spheroids will
 remain on the filter of the strainer, while the medium and non-aggregated cells pass
 through.
