Day 0: generation of 3D neural spheroids with an AggreWell plate
● TIMING 2 h
11. Add 500 μl of anti-adherence rinsing solution to a well of a new AggreWell plate and
 incubate the plate for 5 min at room temperature. Centrifuge the plate at 1,300g for 5 min
 in a swinging bucket rotor to remove any bubbles in the wells. Aspirate the rinsing solution
 and wash with 1 ml of DPBS.
12. Add 1 ml of pre-warmed E8 medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 to each well of the
 AggreWell plate. Centrifuge the plate at 1,300g for 5 min in a swinging bucket rotor to
 remove any bubbles in the wells.
13. Aspirate the medium from the hiPS cell culture plates and rinse the cells with 1 ml of DPBS
 twice.
14. Add 5 ml of Accutase per 10-cm dish and incubate at 37 °C for 7 min in a 5% CO2 incubator.
 At the end of the 7 min, the cells should be easily detached from the plate with gentle
 shaking.
15. Add 5 ml of pre-warmed E8 medium to the cells and collect the suspension into a 50-ml
 conical tube. Gently pipette the cell suspension a few times with a serological pipette to
 ensure that any remining clumps are fully dissociated. Centrifuge the samples at 200g
 for 5 min.
16. Aspirate the supernatant and then resuspend the cells in E8 medium supplemented with
 10 μM Y-27632.
17. Count the cells manually by using a Bright-Line hemacytometer and prepare a cell
 suspension of 3 million cells ml−1. Transfer 1 ml of the cell suspension into a well of an
 AggreWell plate to achieve a final volume of 2 ml per well.
18. Centrifuge the AggreWell plate at 100g for 3 min to distribute the cells in the bottom of
 the micro-wells (Fig. 3a). Carefully transfer the plate into an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.
 Leave the plate untouched for 24 h for the cells to form neural spheroids.
