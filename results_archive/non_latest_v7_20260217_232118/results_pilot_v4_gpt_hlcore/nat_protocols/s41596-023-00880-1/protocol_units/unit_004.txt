Top‑up the conical tube volume to 5 mL with E6/2% FBS and centrifuge the tube at 300 g for 3 min. Aspirate the supernatant and gently flick the tube three times to dislodge the cell pellet. Resuspend the cell pellet to a final volume of 2 mL of E6/2% FBS final volume, adding the medium gradually with a P1000 pipette and gently triturating the pellet during medium addition to resuspend to a single-cell suspension using minimal pipetting.
