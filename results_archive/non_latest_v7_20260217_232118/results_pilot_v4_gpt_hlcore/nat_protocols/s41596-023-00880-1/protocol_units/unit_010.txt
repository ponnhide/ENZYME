Prepare three 15 mL conical tubes for the ‘substrate’ (with DAPI), ‘inhibitor’ (cimetidine) and ‘substrate + inhibitor’ (DAPI + cimetidine) conditions, each containing 4 mL of E6 medium and 4 µL of DRAQ7 dead cell stain (1:1,000 dilution). Add 4 µL of DAPI to ‘substrate’ and ‘substrate + inhibitor’ tubes containing 4 mL of E6 (1:1,000 dilution). Add 4 µL of 100 mM cimetidine to ‘inhibitor’ and ‘substrate + inhibitor’ tubes containing 4 mL of E6 (1:1,000 dilution, final concentration 100 µM). Incubate the organoids for 30 min in a 37 °C incubator. Add ‘substrate’ medium to the three test wells and ‘substrate + inhibitor’ medium to the three control wells, first adding a drop on top of each organoid, then dispensing the remaining 1 mL to the basolateral compartment of each Transwell. Incubate the organoids for 1 h in a 37 °C incubator.
