Day 27: prepare two 15 mL conical tubes for the ‘test’ (with albumin) and ‘control’ (without albumin) conditions, each containing 4 mL of E6 medium. Add 4 µL of TRITC–albumin to 4 mL of E6 within ‘test’ conical tube (1:1,000 dilution). Remove a Transwell plate with six wells of day 27 PT‑enhanced organoids from the incubator. Aspirate culture medium from wells then add TRITC–albumin to ‘test’ wells and plain E6 to ‘control’ wells, first adding a drop on top of each organoid, then dispensing the remaining 1 mL to the basolateral compartment of each Transwell.
