Top up the medium volume in each tube to 200 µL with E6/2% FBS. Centrifuge tubes three times at 300 g for 3 min, rotating the tubes 180° between each centrifugation step. Transfer three micromasses to each Transwell insert, working swiftly without delay. Ensure minimal medium carry‑over by allowing each micromass to settle into the pipette tip opening before dispensing in a single droplet that is touched onto the Transwell membrane.
