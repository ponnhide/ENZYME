      "text": "The lineage recorder is based on the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, which enables efficient transposition of exogenous DNA into multiple genomic loci within iPSCs. A poly-adenylated green or red fluorescent protein (GFP or RFP) reporter is driven by the RPBSA promoter and contains a barcode (11 nucleotides of random bases) in the 3′ untranslated region, which serves as the first channel of the recorder. In the opposite direction, 91 bases away from the RPBSA promoter, we have introduced a human U6 promoter driving a guide RNA (gRNA) that targets a region in the 3′ portion of the sequence coding for GFP or RFP. This iTracer construct is introduced by electroporation into iPSCs that contain a doxycycline-inducible Cas9 cassette (iCRISPR).",
