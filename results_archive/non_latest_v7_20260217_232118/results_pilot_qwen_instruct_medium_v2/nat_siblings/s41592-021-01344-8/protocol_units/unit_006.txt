We first focused on barcodes, which mark clones derived from one given cell in the initializing EB, and explored the clonality of transcriptionally distinct organoid cell clusters. We performed a permutation enrichment analysis using single cells from all lineage-traced organoids together to determine the likelihood that barcode families were shared between cell clusters (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b).
