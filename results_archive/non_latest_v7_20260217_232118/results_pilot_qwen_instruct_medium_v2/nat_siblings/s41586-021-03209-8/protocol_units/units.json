Cells tested negative for mycoplasma. After dissociation, cells were pelleted at 600g in a swinging bucket rotor centrifuge and washed twice in 200 μl CUT&Tag wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Nuclei were isolated by resuspending cell pellets in 200 μl dig-wash buffer (CUT&Tag wash buffer supplemented with 0.05% digitonin and 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630). Nucleus pellets were washed twice in 200 μl dig-wash buffer before resuspension in 100 μl dig-wash buffer supplemented with 2 mM EDTA and a 1:50 dilution of H3K27ac primary antibody (Cell Signaling 8173), and incubated overnight at 4 °C on an overhead rotator. Excess primary antibody was removed by pelleting the nuclei at 600g and washing twice in 200 μl dig-wash buffer. Secondary antibody (Novex A16031) was added at a dilution of 1:50 in 100 μl dig-wash buffer and nuclei were incubated at room temperature for 30 min while rotating. Excess secondary antibody was removed by pelleting the nuclei at 600g and washing twice in 200 μl dig-wash buffer. pA-Tn5 was added at a dilution of 1:100 in 100 μl dig-med buffer (0.05% digitonin, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail), and nuclei were incubated at room temperature for 1 h while rotating. Unbound pA-Tn5 was removed by pelleting the nuclei at 300g and washing twice in 200 μl dig-med buffer. Nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl tagmentation buffer (10 mM MgCl2 in dig-med buffer) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After tagmentation, nuclei were lysed with the addition of 100 μl DNA binding buffer (Zymo Research), and tagmented DNA was purified with a 1.5:1 ratio of AMPure XP beads (Beckman) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified DNA was eluted in 21 μl buffer EB (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) and mixed with 2 μl each 10 μM indexed i5 and i7 primers and 25 μl NEBNext HiFi 2 × PCR Master mix. Libraries were amplified with the cycling conditions: 72 °C for 5 min; 98 °C for 30 s; 12 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s and 63 °C for 30 s; final extension at 72 °C for 1 min and hold at 4 °C.

In brief, we used CellWalker to integrate scRNA-seq derived labels2 with scATAC-seq data by building a network of label-to-cell and cell-to-cell edges and diffusing label information over this combined network to compensate for data sparsity in single-cell data. We calculated cell-to-cell edge weight using the Jaccard similarity between cells. Label-to-cell weight was calculated as the sum of the products of the gene activity scores for that cell and the log fold-change in expression of each marker for that cell label. We tuned label edge weight using cell homogeneity as described17. Diffusion resulted in a vector of influence scores of each label for each cell. We then smoothed these vectors for each cell by taking a weighted average of its scores with those of each of its ten closest neighbours (weighted such that each neighbour contributed one-fifth as much as the cell in question) in UMAP space. Finally, we assigned cell-type labels to each cell using the label with the highest influence.",
