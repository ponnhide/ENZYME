Cell Ranger. BCL files generated from sequencing were used as inputs to the 10X Genomics Cell Ranger ATAC pipeline. In brief, FASTQ files were generated and aligned to GRCh38 using BWA. Fragment files were generated containing all unique properly paired and aligned fragments with mapping quality (MAPQ) >30. Each unique fragment was associated with a single cell barcode.
