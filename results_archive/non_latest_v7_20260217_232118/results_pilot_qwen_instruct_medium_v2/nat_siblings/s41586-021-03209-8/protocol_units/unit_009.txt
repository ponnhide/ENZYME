Fragment files generated from the Cell Ranger ATAC pipeline were loaded into the SnapATAC61 pipeline (https://github.com/r3fang/SnapATAC) and Snap files were generated. A cell-by-bin matrix was then generated for each sample by segmenting the genome into 5-kb windows and scoring each cell for reads in each window. Cells were filtered based on log(reads passed filters) between 3 and 5 and fraction of reads in promoters between 10 and 60% to obtain cells with high quality libraries.
