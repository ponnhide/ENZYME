Bulk ATAC-seq libraries were generated as described57. In brief, 50,000 nuclei were permeablized and tagmented. Tagmented chromatin libraries were generated and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq with a target sequencing depth of 50 million reads per library. Sequencing data were used as an input to the ENCODE ATAC-seq analysis pipeline (https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/atac-seq-pipeline).
