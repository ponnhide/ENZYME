For experiments involving irradiation, DSS, and cytomix, organoids were cultured as above in microwell plates for 5 days. On the 5th day after seeding, injury conditions were applied. For irradiation studies, the plates were placed on the center of the rotating table of the irradiator (J.L. Shepherd and Associates, Mark I series, model 68A, Cesium (137Cs) gamma irradiator) for the time periods equivalent to either 6 Gy or 12 Gy, and then the organoids were further cultured in the incubator.
