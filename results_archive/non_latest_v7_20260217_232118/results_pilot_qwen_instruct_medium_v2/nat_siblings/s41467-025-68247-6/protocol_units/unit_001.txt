To clean the tissue and isolate fresh crypts for organoid generation, colon tissue was first sliced open lengthwise and wiped 3–4 times with gauze (Fisher Scientific) to remove waste and mucus. The tissue was then cut into small sections of ~2” × 2” and placed into a 15 cm dish filled with PBS++ (PBS supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X Pen-Strep (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 2.5 μg/mL Amphotericin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The epithelium was then minced from tissue segments using scalpels (Fisher Scientific) and collected into 50 mL conical tubes. Minced epithelium was washed 3 times with DMEM++ (Advanced DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 1X GlutaMAX, 1X Pen-Strep, and 2.5 μg/mL Amphotericin B), and centrifuged at 4 °C, 500 × g for 3 min between each wash.
