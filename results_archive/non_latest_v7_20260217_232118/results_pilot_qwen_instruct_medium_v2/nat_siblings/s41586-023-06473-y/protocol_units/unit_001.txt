To establish an organoid system that enables CRISPR perturbations with single-cell transcriptomic readout, we used a human embryonic stem cell (hES cell) line expressing an enhanced specificity SpCas9 (eCas9), which has substantially reduced off-target effects and is controlled by an upstream loxp stop element12 (Fig. 1a).
