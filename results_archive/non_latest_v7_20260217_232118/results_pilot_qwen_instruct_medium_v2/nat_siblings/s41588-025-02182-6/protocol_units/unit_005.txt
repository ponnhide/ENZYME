To explore organoid cell states of different stem cell origin, we focused on intestinal organoid models in which there is substantial coverage from PSC-, FSC- and ASC-derived organoid cells. This subset consisted of 98 samples from 23 different publications representing 353,140 single-cell transcriptomes (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 1). We reintegrated all cells and defined 5 cell types at level 1, 26 cell types at level 2 and 32 cell types at level 3 in the atlas (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 6b,c).
