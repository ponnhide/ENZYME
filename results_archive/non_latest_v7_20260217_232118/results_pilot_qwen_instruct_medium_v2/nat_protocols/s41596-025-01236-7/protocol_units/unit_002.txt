20. Day 0. Before initiating the differentiation, first aspirate the culture medium and wash with 1 ml of PBS, before adding 1 ml of the phase I medium (Table 6).
▲ CRITICAL STEP The washing step with PBS is critical because mTeSR Plus medium contains growth factors (transforming growth factor-β1 and FGF2) that could potentially have some lingering side effects during differentiations.
21. Days 2 and 3. Replace with 1.2 ml of fresh phase 1 medium.
▲ CRITICAL STEP Do not change the medium on day 1 with phase I medium. Excessive WNT signaling activation by CHIR99021 will induce dramatic cell death.
▲ CRITICAL STEP After day 2, the medium will turn bright yellow overnight, indicating that the metabolic activity is high. It is important to change the medium on both day 2 and day 3. Otherwise, drastic cell death will lead to failed differentiation.
