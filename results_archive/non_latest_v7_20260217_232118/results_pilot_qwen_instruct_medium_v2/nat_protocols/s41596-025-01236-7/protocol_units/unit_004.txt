24. On day 7, aspirate the phase II medium and add 1.2 ml of phase III medium (Table 6).
25. Days 8 and 9. Renew the medium with 1.2 ml of fresh phase III medium.
26. Day 10. Observe the cells under a microscope. iNPCs on day 10 of differentiation should exhibit their signature cluster morphology in which they condense together and show bright SIX2-GFP (Fig. 2a,b). The differentiated cells are now ready for dissociation and FACS to purify the iNPCs.
