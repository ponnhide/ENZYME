53. Day −1. After dissociation to single cells (Steps 37–39), count the cells by using the TC20 automated cell counter.
54. Centrifuge at 300g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with an appropriate volume of hNPSR-v2 medium so that each 100 µl of medium contains 25,000–30,000 iNPCs.
55. Seed ~25,000–30,000 iNPCs into one well of a 96-well U-bottom low-attachment plate in 100 µl of hNPSR-v2 medium and then centrifuge the plate at 300g for 5 min.
▲ CRITICAL STEP We suggest adding PBS to the outer boundary wells of the 96-well U-bottom plate to minimize evaporation.
56. After centrifugation, place the plate in the incubator to allow the cells to aggregate overnight.
57. Day 0. The iNPC aggregates are transferred to the membrane of a Transwell for air–liquid interface culture. First, in a six-well Transwell plate, add 1 ml of phase I medium (Table 7) to the bottom chamber of each well. The other unused Transwell inserts from the Transwell plate can be transferred to another regular sterile six-well cell culture plate for future use.
58. To transfer the aggregates without compromising their spherical structure, cut the tip of a P200 pipette tip to carefully pick up and place the iNPC aggregates on the Transwell membrane.
59. Use a new uncut P200 pipette tip to carefully pipette out the surrounding medium that lingered from the transfer so that the aggregates can attach to the membrane.
▲ CRITICAL STEP We recommend placing no more than six iNPC aggregates onto each well of a Transwell membrane to ensure enough space and medium nutrients for the nephron organoids to develop.
60. Place the Transwell plate in the incubator for 1 h. After 1 h, remove the phase I medium and directly add 1 ml of phase II medium (Table 7) into the bottom chamber of the Transwell plate.
▲ CRITICAL STEP It is critical to remove most of the phase I medium, because residual CHIR99021 could have some detrimental side effects to the iNPC aggregates. When removing the phase I medium, carefully lift up the Transwell insert and aspirate the well and the bottom area of the membrane without damaging the membrane.
61. Days 2 and 4. Change the medium with 1 ml of fresh phase II medium.
62. Day 5. Remove the phase II medium and add 1 ml of phase III medium (Table 7) into the bottom chamber of the Transwell plate.
63. Days 7–19. Starting on day 7, change the medium with 1 ml of fresh phase III medium every other day. Note the dramatic morphological changes as nephron organoids develop (Fig. 4a). Specifically, look for the formation of RV/comma-shaped body/SSB-like structures in the organoids from days 5–8 (Fig. 4a,b) and the formation of tubule-like structures from days 12–21, indicating further nephron development (Fig. 4a,c).
◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
64. Day 21. Harvest the iNPC-derived nephron organoids for various assays to characterize the organoids (Step 65).
• Note that iNPC-derived nephron organoids can be harvested for various assays at any time point of the differentiation for different purposes. Extended organoid culture in phase III medium beyond day 21 is not recommended. The organoids might be unhealthy after day 21.
