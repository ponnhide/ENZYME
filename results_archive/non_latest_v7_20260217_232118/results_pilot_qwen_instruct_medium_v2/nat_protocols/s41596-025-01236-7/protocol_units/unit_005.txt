31. If using cells with an NPC-specific reporter such as the SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry dual reporter, follow option A. For iNPC line derivation from hPSC lines that have no NPC-specific reporters for FACS, follow option B. Alternatively, if there are large populations of off-target cells after hPSC-to-iNPC differentiation, follow option C to sort for cell surface marker ITGA8 via FACS.
(A) FACS with an NPC-specific reporter
(i) Remove the supernatant. Use a P1000 pipette to add 1 ml of FACS medium containing 0.33 µl of Hoechst 33342 at a ratio of 1:3,000 (serving as a viability marker for FACS) and resuspend the cell pellet by pipetting up and down gently three to five times.
(ii) Filter the cell solution through a strainer cap of a Falcon round-bottom tube.
(iii) FACS of iNPCs through BD FACSAria III cell sorter. For the SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry dual reporter hPSC line, GFP+;mCherry+ iNPCs are sorted as shown in Fig. 2c.
See also Supplementary Fig. 1a for an example of full FACS gating plots.
