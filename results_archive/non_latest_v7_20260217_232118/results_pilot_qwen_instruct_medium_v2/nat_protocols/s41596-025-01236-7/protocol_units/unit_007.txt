42. 200,000–1,000,000 cells can be frozen in 0.5 ml of Bambanker cell freezing medium per cryovial (1.5-ml Nalgene SYSTEM 100 cryogenic vial). To do so, after Step 39, first count the total number of cells harvested.
43. Then, calculate the number of cryovials needed on the basis of the total number of cells. Centrifuge the cells at 300g for 5 min, resuspend the cell pellet with an appropriate volume of Bambanker cell freezing medium and distribute a 0.5-ml aliquot of the cell suspension in each cryovial. As an example, if the counted total cell number is 2,000,000 cells from Step 42 and the plan is to freeze 200,000 cells in each cryovial, then you will need to resuspend the cells in 5 ml of Bambanker cell freezing medium and then distribute a 0.5-ml aliquot per cryovial, leaving a total of 10 cryovials with 200,000 cells each.
44. Transfer the cryovials into a −80 °C freezer.
■ PAUSE POINT The cells can be stored at – 80 °C for ≤1 year. For long-term storage, transfer the cryovials from the −80 °C freezer to a liquid nitrogen tank.
