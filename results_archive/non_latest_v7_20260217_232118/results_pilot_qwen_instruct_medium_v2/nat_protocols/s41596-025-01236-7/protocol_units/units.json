Confirm that hPSCs have reached a confluency of 75–90%.\n◆ TROUBLESHOOTING\n▲ CAUTION When working with multiple cell lines at the same time, it is very important not to misidentify the different cell lines and to avoid the possibility of cross-contaminating.\n3. Aspirate the mTeSR Plus culture medium and wash the cells with 1 ml of room temperature PBS. After aspirating the PBS, add 500 µl of pre-warmed Versene solution (or room temperature 0.5 mM EDTA) and incubate at 37 °C in an incubator for 5–6 min.\n4. After the incubation time is up, carefully observe the cell morphology under the microscope. Expect to see the light penetrating through the condense regions of the cells.\n5. Once most of the well is bright, carefully aspirate the dissociation medium.\n6. Using a P1000 pipette, use 1 ml of mTeSR Plus medium to gently detach the cells and break up hPSC colonies to small clusters. Then, transfer the cells to a 1.7-ml Eppendorf tube.\n▲ CAUTION Gently pipette no more than five times, because the mechanical stress can induce spontaneous differentiation. It is normal to have clusters of cells with different sizes, which will not affect hPSC expansion.\n7. In a new 1.7-ml Eppendorf tube, prepare 1 ml of mTeSR Plus for one well of a 12-well plate. Seed the cells at a 1:12 ratio to the newly prepared mTeSR.\n8. Aspirate the Matrigel-coating medium from the well and add your passaged cells in mTeSR Plus to the well. Return to the incubator.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP Once the cells have been plated, gently jolt the plate up and down and left and right to equally distribute the cells in each well.\n9. Days 2–5. Starting on day 2 (where day 0 is the day of cell seeding in Step 8), change the medium every other day with fresh mTeSR Plus medium (no medium change is needed on day 1). Healthy hPSCs will reach a confluency of 80–90% 4–5 d after passage. This suggests that their cell proliferation rates are following the normal logarithmic growth. In addition, this indicates that the cells are ready to proceed for NPC differentiation.",

After centrifugation, place the plate in the incubator to allow the cells to aggregate overnight.\n57. Day 0. The iNPC aggregates are transferred to the membrane of a Transwell for air–liquid interface culture. First, in a six-well Transwell plate, add 1 ml of phase I medium (Table 7) to the bottom chamber of each well. The other unused Transwell inserts from the Transwell plate can be transferred to another regular sterile six-well cell culture plate for future use.\n58. To transfer the aggregates without compromising their spherical structure, cut the tip of a P200 pipette tip to carefully pick up and place the iNPC aggregates on the Transwell membrane.\n59. Use a new uncut P200 pipette tip to carefully pipette out the surrounding medium that lingered from the transfer so that the aggregates can attach to the membrane.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP We recommend placing no more than six iNPC aggregates onto each well of a Transwell membrane to ensure enough space and medium nutrients for the nephron organoids to develop.\n60. Place the Transwell plate in the incubator for 1 h. After 1 h, remove the phase I medium and directly add 1 ml of phase II medium (Table 7) into the bottom chamber of the Transwell plate.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP It is critical to remove most of the phase I medium, because residual CHIR99021 could have some detrimental side effects to the iNPC aggregates. When removing the phase I medium, carefully lift up the Transwell insert and aspirate the well and the bottom area of the membrane without damaging the membrane.\n61. Days 2 and 4.

      "text": "65. At the end of phase III (day 21), iNPC-derived nephron organoids are ready for characterization: follow option A for immunofluorescence staining and option B to prepare samples for RT-qPCR.\n(A) Immunofluorescence staining\n(i) To prepare samples for immunostaining, remove the Transwell insert from the six-well plate and peel the whole Transwell membrane off by using fine forceps (organoids should stay on the top of the membrane).\n(ii) Use a blade or fine scissors to cut the Transwell membrane into smaller pieces (~5 mm), with each piece containing one organoid in the center.\n(iii) Use forceps to transfer each Transwell membrane piece with an organoid into one 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 200 µl of 10% (vol/vol) FBS medium.\n▲ CRITICAL STEP It is important to use a solution containing FBS to transfer the organoids. When basal medium without FBS or PBS is used, organoids can stick to the Eppendorf tube, leading to loss of samples.\n(iv) Aspirate the 10% (vol/vol) FBS medium and add 200 µl of 4% PFA (wt/vol) for fixation at room temperature for 12 min.\n(v) Aspirate the 4% PFA and wash the organoid with 500 µl of PBS three times.\n(vi) Aspirate the PBS after the last wash. Add 500 µl of blocking buffer and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\n(vii) Aspirate the blocking buffer and add 200 µl of blocking buffer containing the desired primary antibodies for incubation overnight at 4 °C. Information on our commonly used and validated antibodies for nephron organoid characterization and their dilution ratios is listed in Table 2.\n(viii) Aspirate the primary antibody solution and add 500 µl of PBST to wash the well three times.\n(ix) Aspirate the PBST after the last wash and add 200 µl of blocking buffer containing the desired secondary antibodies for incubation overnight at 4 °C.\n(x) Aspirate the secondary antibody solution and then wash the well with 500 µl of PBST three to five times.\n(xi) Use forceps to hold the Transwell membrane piece and transfer the piece with an organoid onto a microscope slide.\n(xii) Remove excessive PBST and then add ~20 µl of mounting medium.\n(xiii) Carefully place a microscope coverslip on the sample (avoid bubble formation). Note, the coverslip may flatten the organoid, but it will not compromise its 3D structure.\n(xiv) Seal the sample with clear nail polish surrounding the coverslip. The sample is now ready for imaging by using epifluorescence microscopy or confocal microscopy.\niNPC-derived nephron organoids should display NPHS1+/NPHS2+/PODXL+/MAFB+ podocytes, LTL+/LRP2+/HNF4A+ proximal tubules, SLC12A1+ loops of Henle and POU3F3+/CDH1+ distal nephrons.",
