Introduction

Nephrons are the functional units of the kidney. On average, 1 million nephrons are present in
one human kidney. Each nephron consists of >30 different cell types that are spatially organized
to perform its diverse kidney functions from glomerular filtration to tubular reabsorption and
secretion1–4. Six2+ nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) have a central role in kidney organogenesis:
they self-renew and give rise to all the major nephron cell types5. Over the past decade, kidney
organoids have been developed from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) by recapitulating
normal kidney organogenesis6–22. To develop nephron organoids, hPSCs transition sequentially
through mesoderm, intermediate mesoderm and posterior intermediate mesoderm to
generate a transient hPSC-induced NPC (iNPC) population. These transient iNPCs then
further develop into nephron cell types in the organoids. Those pioneering in vitro human
kidney models have enhanced our understanding of human kidney development and disease
mechanisms23. Despite the progress, cellular immaturity and the presence of large numbers of
off-target cell types in hPSC-derived kidney organoids have hindered the development of safe
and effective kidney-replacement therapies and prevented the accurate modeling of kidney
diseases, especially adult-onset diseases23–27. In this protocol, we describe in detail our recently
published methodologies for deriving long-term expandable human iNPC lines from hPSCs.
These iNPC lines exhibit a stable cell-proliferation rate, retain NPC marker gene expression
over long-term culture and can be directly used for the generation of nephron organoids,
demonstrating minimal off-target cell types with enhanced organoid maturity28 (Fig. 1).

Development of the protocol
To track and purify hPSC-derived iNPCs, we first used the CRISPR–Cas9 system to engineer
hPSCs with a SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry dual reporter system28,29. The protocol to induce transient
iNPCs from hPSCs was optimized from a previously published Morizane protocol7,30 by using
a series of different combinations of growth factors and small molecules at each stage of hPSC
differentiation to mirror the respective signals activated during kidney organogenesis. In the first
stage to generate a primitive streak from hPSCs, a combination of WNT agonist (CHIR99021) and
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitor (noggin or dorsomorphin) was used in the original
Morizane protocol. Here, we used a different BMP inhibitor, LDN193189, which is commonly used

Protocol


for inhibiting BMP signaling. During stage two to generate posterior intermediate mesoderm
from a primitive streak (D4–D7), we noticed dramatic cell death when following the original
protocol, which eventually led to failed differentiation. We found that incorporation of a Rhokinase inhibitor (Y-27632) was able to improve cell survival at this stage, and thus Y-27632 was
added in stage two, in addition to activin A from the original protocol. At the third stage of
differentiation from posterior intermediate mesoderm to NPCs, we used 50 ng ml−1 fibroblast
growth factor 9 (FGF9) instead of the original 10 ng ml−1, because this change significantly
increased SIX2+/PAX2+ iNPC induction efficiency based on dual reporter expression28. By
following this optimized hPSC-to-iNPC differentiation protocol, typically 30–50% of the cells will
be SIX2+ (10–20% will be SIX2+/PAX2+) based on FACS analysis at the end of stage three28.
 FACS-purified SIX2+/PAX2+ iNPCs were then cultured in a chemically defined human nephron
progenitor self-renewal (hNPSR)-v2 medium for expansion28. The hNPSR-v2 medium was
developed from further optimizing our previously described culture medium that can expand
primary mouse NPCs in 3D culture29. The rationale for the development of the NPC culture
condition was to mirror the nephrogenic niche environment that promotes the self-renewal
of the proliferating NPCs in vivo. On the basis of our previously described mNPSR-v1 medium
recipe to culture mouse NPCs as 3D aggregates29,31, which include FGF2, which promotes NPC
survival; BMP7 and mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which maintain NPC survival and
stemness; CHIR99021, which mirrors the WNT11 signal in vivo that is critical for maintaining
NPC self-renewal; Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor); heparin (FGF co-factor); A83-01 (transforming
growth factor-β signaling inhibitor); and LDN193189 (BMP signaling inhibitor), we further
screened culture conditions and developed an mNPSR-v2 medium that allows clonal expansion
of mouse NPCs in a regular monolayer culture format instead of 3D aggregate culture28. Key
to the transition from 3D to 2D culture is the use of two additional small molecules, SB202190
(p38 MAPK inhibitor) and DAPT32 (Notch signaling inhibitor). The CHIR99021 concentration
was also adjusted from 1 µM in 3D culture to 1.5 µM in 2D culture. To develop an optimal human
iNPC culture condition, we first replaced mouse LIF in mNPSR-v2 with human LIF to formulate
hNPSR-v1 medium, because mouse LIF does not activate human LIF receptors. However, human
iNPCs cultured in hNPSR-v1 medium were able to maintain their NPC identity for only 2 weeks
before a gradual decline of cell proliferation activity and key NPC marker gene expression
was observed. YAP activity has been reported to have critical roles in NPC self-renewal
in vivo33. Upon observation of decreased YAP activity in the iNPCs cultured with hNPSR-v1,
we supplemented TRULI, a small-molecule YAP agonist34, to hNPSR-v1 medium to formulate
hNPSR-v2 medium. The hNPSR-v2 medium allows long-term expansion of the iNPCs over several
months with retained NPC marker gene expression and nephrogenic potential28. Importantly,
the hNPSR-v2 medium can enrich the transient iNPCs from hPSC differentiation over serial
passages, even if the iNPCs were not purified by FACS at the beginning of the culture28. This
feature allows the derivation of iNPC lines from any hPSC line without prior genome editing to
knock in the SIX2/PAX2 dual reporter system, greatly broadening the applications.
 Long-term expanded iNPCs in hNPSR-v2 medium retain their developmental potential to
undergo their nephron fate28. First, the iNPCs are dissociated into single cells and reaggregated
to form iNPC aggregates in 96-well low-attachment U-bottom plates. The iNPC aggregates are
then transferred to Transwell culture at the air–liquid interface, a condition used for decades
for mouse kidney explant culture35,36 and for kidney organoid development6–8. To mirror
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), the initiation step of nephron induction from
NPCs, CHIR990217,8 is used to mimic the nephron-inducing WNT9b signal from the developing
ureteric bud in vivo37. Upon the initial Wnt signaling activation, iNPCs will differentiate into
nephron structures within 2–3 weeks. Transitioning from APEL2 basal medium to advanced
RPMI 1640 medium on day 5 of organoid development can better support the structural
integrity of the organoid, especially the maintenance of nephron tubule architecture.
Supplementation of A83-01 should result in increased organoid maturity, as observed by
specific collagen markers in the podocytes and megalin (LRP2) in the proximal tubules28. Thus,
these parameters are included in the iNPC-to-nephron organoid differentiation procedures.
By following this protocol, major nephron segments are induced within 2 weeks of iNPC
differentiation, with more maturity observed after 3 weeks of differentiation.

Protocol


Alternative methods
Multiple protocols have described the generation of hPSC-derived iNPCs, transitioning
sequentially through mesoderm, intermediate mesoderm and posterior intermediate
mesoderm, recapitulating normal kidney organogenesis7,8,22. However, in these protocols,
these iNPCs are transient and are induced to undergo MET to generate nephron structures
immediately after they are formed. Direct reprogramming38 (or trans-differentiation) from
fibroblasts to nephron progenitor-like cells through the forced expression of NPC-specific
transcription factors has also been reported39,40. In addition, culture conditions have been
described to expand hPSC-derived iNPCs for a short period of time (up to two passages,
or 14 d)41,42. Compared to these alternative methods to produce nephron progenitor-like
cells in vitro, the protocol described here can stably expand hPSC-derived iNPCs for several
months with high purity (90–95% SIX2+) and retained nephrogenic potential, allowing scalable
manufacturing of high-quality human iNPCs for regenerative medicine and other applications.
Importantly, transcriptome analysis of the iNPCs cultured in hNPSR-v2 medium indicated better
resemblance to primary human NPCs in vivo, as compared to the transient iNPCs generated
from hPSC differentiation. Nephron organoids have been generated from hPSCs transitioning
through the transient iNPCs6–22. Compared to these hPSC-derived nephron organoids,
cultured iNPC-derived nephron organoids show minimal off-target cell types and increased
nephron maturity, such as the formation of COL4A3+/COL4A4+ mature podocytes28. A recent
publication20 used an improved iNPC specification step from the standard nephron organoid
protocol8 and demonstrated significant enhancement of proximal tubule segmentation and
maturity, which is consistent with our observation that NPCs with higher quality will be able to
generate more mature nephrons.

Application
The ability to manufacture near-pure human iNPCs presents an unprecedented opportunity to
study human kidney development, disease and regeneration. We showed in a proof-of-concept
genome-wide CRISPR screen in cultured mouse NPCs that candidate genes regulating NPC
self-renewal can be unbiasedly identified, with implications in congenital kidney disease and
Wilms tumor development28. Similar genome-scale screening or omics approaches can be
applied to in vitro accessible human iNPCs to understand human NPC biology. We showed that
genome editing can be performed directly in iNPC lines, allowing rapid genetic modifications in
iNPCs and assessment of their functional consequences in nephron organoids. As an example,
we showed that polycystic kidney disease 2 gene-knockout (PKD2−/−) iNPCs are expandable
and can reproducibly and highly efficiently generate cystic nephron organoids recapitulating
the disease phenotype28. By following a similar approach, other disease-related genetic
modifications can be introduced to the iNPC lines to generate novel models of kidney diseases.
We also showed that hNPSR-v2 medium was able to reprogram hPSC-derived podocytes or
primary podocytes isolated from human fetal kidneys to an NPC-like state, revealing previously
unknown podocyte plasticity28. This in vitro model offers an opportunity to understand the
detailed molecular mechanisms underlying kidney cell plasticity in the future. Compared
to hPSC-derived nephron organoids, podocytes generated from the iNPC-derived nephron
organoids show higher expression of mature podocyte marker genes such as COL4A3 and
COL4A4, offering a potential tool to model glomerular diseases that cannot be recapitulated
with current podocyte models that do not express these genes. However, it is important to
consider the following limitations before using this model to study glomerular diseases:
(i) these iNPC-derived nephron organoids are not vascularized, preventing the modeling
of glomerular filtration as in a perfused glomerulus in vivo; and (ii) whether specialized
podocyte structures (e.g., slit diaphragm) are properly formed in this in vitro model remains
to be determined.

Limitations
It is important to note that although cultured iNPCs are similar to primary human NPCs in global
gene expression and in developmental potential, some differences still exist. For example, upon

Protocol


long-term culture, iNPCs tend to decrease the expression of PAX2, a transcription factor that is
well established in kidney development on the basis of mouse genetics studies1,43. Interestingly,
decreased expression of PAX2 appears not to affect iNPC differentiation into nephron organoids
when following this protocol using Transwell culture. This is consistent with a prior observation
that PAX2-knockout hPSCs can differentiate into nephron organoids44. PAX8, a paralog of
PAX2 that shares similar transcriptional activity45, is highly expressed in iNPCs, probably
compensating for PAX2 reduction over time. Nevertheless, limitations may exist for using the
iNPC model to study the function of PAX2 in human kidney development and its dysfunction in
the development of congenital kidney diseases.
 Compared to standard hPSC-derived nephron organoids7,8 without an NPC purification
step, purified iNPC line–derived nephron organoids show dramatically reduced off-target
cells as expected (0.67% as shown by single-cell multiome analysis28). Interestingly, podocytes
reproducibly dominate the nephron cell types found in iNPC-derived nephron organoids (on
the basis of different batches of experiments, 70–90% are podocytes, while 10–30% are tubules).
Because this biased podocyte differentiation is evident in iNPC lines at both early and late
passages, this phenomenon probably reflects an intrinsic bias from the use of purified iNPCs for
differentiation. Future efforts are warranted to understand the underlying mechanisms and to
modify the iNPC differentiation protocol to generate a nephron organoid with the presence of
balanced nephron cell types, especially the improvement of nephron tubule formation. Thus,
current iNPC-derived nephron organoids are not ideal for modeling diseases in which tubules
are the primary sites of pathology.
 Compared to a complex kidney in vivo, both iNPC-derived nephron organoids and hPSCderived nephron organoids share a few common limitations, such as insufficient nephron
patterning as seen in vivo (e.g., frequent formation of scattered but not continuous nephron
segments and lack of a cortical-medullary axis), immaturity of nephron tubules (e.g., proximal
tubule cells do not express high levels of transporters essential for kidney functions, such as the
organic anion/cation transporters, and loop of Henle cells do not express uromodulin/UMOD)
and the lack of major kidney cell types within the nephron lineage (e.g., SLC12A3+ distal
convoluted tubule) and beyond the nephron lineage (collecting duct, stroma, vasculature and
neuronal systems).

Overview of the procedure
hPSCs are routinely cultured in mTeSR Plus medium (Steps 1–9) and then differentiated into
iNPCs by using a three-stage protocol in 10 d (Steps 10–30). For hPSC lines that have an NPCspecific reporter (e.g., SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry dual reporter), differentiated iNPCs are purified
by FACS (Step 31A); for hPSC lines without an NPC-specific reporter, differentiated cells are
cultured in hNPSR-v2 medium, which will lead to enrichment of the iNPC population over a few
passages (Step 31B); for hPSC lines without an NPC-specific reporter, in which the differentiated
cells have a lot of off-target cells, cell surface marker integrin subunit-α 8 (ITGA8) is used to
enrich iNPCs (Step 31C). The purified or enriched iNPCs can be cultured stably in hNPSR-v2
medium for expansion (Steps 32–41) or cryopreserved for long-term storage (Steps 42–44).
Cultured iNPCs should be routinely characterized by immunostaining every four to five
passages (2–3 weeks) to verify iNPC identity and purity (Steps 45–52). Cultured iNPCs can
differentiate into nephron organoids in a six-well Transwell plate in three phases within 21 d
(Steps 53–64). The quality of nephron organoid generation can be assessed by immunostaining
and RT-qPCR (Step 65).

Experimental design
Maintenance of hPSCs
The hPSCs are routinely maintained in feeder-free conditions in commercially available mTeSR
Plus medium (STEMCELL Technologies). Routine testing for mycoplasma is performed, and
hPSCs are discarded if they test positive. Extracellular matrix Matrigel and various Matrigel
alternatives have been used to coat the plates for the expansion of hPSCs. In this manuscript,
although we still use the term ‘Matrigel’ to indicate the extracellular matrix, we actually use


Nature Protocols 5

Protocol


a Matrigel alternative, Cultrex (R&D Systems), in our laboratory rather than the traditional
Matrigel (BD Biosciences). No differences between the two extracellular matrixes are observed
in supporting hPSC expansion. The hPSCs are passaged by using a gentle dissociation method
using Versene solution (or 0.5 mM EDTA solution) to get small clumps for replating. If hPSCs
are thawed for experimental use, it is highly recommended to let them recover for two to three
passages before proceeding for differentiation. We recommend using hPSC lines with no more
than 75 passages.

Differentiation of hPSCs to iNPCs
The induction of NPCs from hPSCs has been optimized on the basis of previous studies7,30.
The modified iNPC differentiation described has been demonstrated to be reproducible in two
human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines: H1 and H928. Each stage medium is tailored to capture
each developmental stage that sequentially gives rise to iNPCs. The stage I medium initiates
hPSC differentiation to the late primitive streak stage. The stage II medium then specifies the
posterior intermediate mesoderm from the primitive streak. Finally, the stage III medium is to
enrich the NPC populations in the presence of a high concentration of FGF9. On the last day of
the differentiation, the differentiating cells are dissociated to single cells for FACS to purify/
enrich iNPCs. We use a dual reporter of SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry to collect the iNPC population
with high expression of GFP and mCherry, as well as other lines with SIX2-GFP so that sorting can
be done by using the specific marker of SIX2. For hPSC lines that do not have the NPC-specific
reporter system, differentiated cells containing iNPCs can be cultured without FACS in the
hNPSR-v2 medium. Continuous culture in hNPSR-v2 medium will enrich the iNPC population
over two to three passages, reaching ~90% SIX2 positivity by immunostaining. Alternatively, if
there are large populations of off-target cell types after hPSC-iNPC differentiation, FACS can be
used to sort for ITGA8 to further purify.

Expansion of iNPCs with hNPSR-v2 medium and cryopreservation of iNPCs
Once the hPSC-derived iNPCs have been purified via FACS, they are immediately cultured
in hNPSR-v2 medium. Within 2–3 d, these iNPCs form clusters in culture as observed for the
culture of primary human NPCs. Transcriptomes of the iNPCs cultured in hNPSR-v2 medium
are similar to primary NPCs28. hNPSR-v2 medium is refreshed every 1–2 d. Once the iNPCs
reach a confluency of 80–90%, they are dissociated into single cells with Accumax and
passaged at a 1:10 split ratio on Matrigel (Cultrex)-coated plates. Efficient freeze and thaw
can be achieved for cultured iNPCs with commercially available freezing medium Bambanker.
iNPC lines can also be derived without prior FACS purification, which relies on hNPSR-v2
medium to enrich the iNPC population over serial passages. These iNPC lines share similar
properties with the FACS-purified iNPC lines described above and can also be passaged and
cryopreserved.

Generation of nephron organoids from iNPCs
The expandable iNPCs can be used for nephron organoid formation. Once the iNPCs have
reached a confluency of 80–90%, they are dissociated into single cells and reaggregated
at 30,000 cells per aggregate to form iNPC aggregates overnight in 96-well U-bottom lowattachment plates. iNPC aggregates are then gently transferred to a six-well Transwell plate
for air–liquid interface culture. The aggregates are treated with 6 µM CHIR99021 for 1 h
(phase I medium), which mimics the natural epithelization signal in vivo. For the first 5 d,
the aggregates are cultured in phase II medium containing FGF9. Starting from day 5, the
resulting organoids will undergo clear morphological changes that probably reflect the
initial nephrogenesis stages transitioning through renal vesicle (RV), comma-shaped body
and S-shaped body (SSB). On day 5, culture medium is switched to phase III medium, which
supports the maturation of nephron cell types until day 21. At the day of harvest, the organoids
can be prepared for various assays such as whole-mount staining, RNA and protein extraction
for multi-omics analysis and/or assays to determine physiological functions. We usually
use iNPC lines that are cultured for ≤2 months, but iNPC lines cultured for 100 d can still
differentiate into nephron organoids28.

0.5 mM EDTA dissociation solution
Using a brand new unopened 500-ml PBS, 1× without calcium and magnesium bottle, add 500 µl
of UltraPure 0.5 M EDTA to make the 0.5 mM EDTA dissociation solution for hPSC passaging.
The bottle can be stored at room temperature (20–22 °C) for ≤12 months.

hNPSR-v2 medium
Once the individual component stocks are properly prepared as outlined above, thaw the
aliquots of component stocks and use them to prepare 100 ml of complete hNPSR-v2 medium
by referring to Table 4. All stock aliquots can be used for the preparation of 100 ml of complete
hNPSR-v2 medium, except for 10 mM A83-01 stock (first stock), which needs to be further
diluted by mixing 1µl of 10 mM A83-01 with 199 μl of DMEM/F12 medium to make a 50 μM
A83-01 stock solution (second stock). The thawed stock medium components have different
shelf-lives. For growth factors, it is best to store them at 4 °C and use them within 2 weeks. For
small molecules, including the second stock of A83-01, they are good for ≤1 month at 4 °C.
The complete hNPSR-v2 medium can be stored at 4 °C for 2 weeks.

Matrigel-coated 12-well plate for the derivation of iNPC lines and iNPC culture
Use a serological pipette controller to transfer 25 ml of cold DMEM/F12 into a 50-ml centrifuge
tube and then take 1 ml of cold DMEM/F12 to directly dissolve one aliquot of Matrigel stock
(1 mg). Dissolve the Matrigel by pipetting up and down several times until completely dissolved.
Transfer the 1 ml of dissolved Matrigel into the remaining 24 ml of cold DMEM/F12, mix the
50-ml centrifuge tube well by inverting several times and then transfer 1 ml of the cold Matrigel
solution into one well of a 12-well plate. Place the plate into the incubator for a minimum of 1 h
before use. The coated plate can be stored in the incubator for ≤10 d.

PBST buffer
Add 1.5 ml of Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) into 500 ml of PBS solution and then mix well through
upside down for several times until Triton X-100 is completely dissolved. This makes PBST
buffer with a 0.03% final concentration of Triton X-100. PBST can be stored at room temperature
for ≤6 months.

Medium for hPSC-to-iNPC differentiation
Once the individual component stocks are properly prepared as outlined above, thaw the
aliquots of component stocks and use them to prepare phase I, II and III medium for hPSC-toiNPC differentiation by referring to Table 6. The prepared medium can be stored at 4 °C for
2 weeks.

Medium for iNPC differentiation into nephron organoid
Once the individual component stocks are properly prepared as outlined above, thaw the
aliquots of component stocks and use them to prepare phase I, II and III medium for iNPC
differentiation into nephron organoid by referring to Table 7. The prepared medium can be
stored at 4 °C for 2 weeks.

Blocking buffer for immunostaining

in 100 ml of PBST. Mix well. Blocking buffer can be stored at 4 °C for ≤1 week.


Procedure

hPSC passaging and expansion in preparation for hPSC-to-iNPC differentiation
● TIMING 9 d
▲ CRITICAL hPSCs are ready for passaging when they have reached a confluency of 75–90%.
If starting from thawed hPSCs, the cells should be passaged at least twice to recover from the
freeze–thaw process. This will ensure high differentiation efficiency.

1. Day 0. incubate a Matrigel-coated 12-well plate (1 ml per well) at 37 °C for ≥1 h before use.
2. Confirm that hPSCs have reached a confluency of 75–90%.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
 ▲ CAUTION When working with multiple cell lines at the same time, it is very important not
 to misidentify the different cell lines and to avoid the possibility of cross-contaminating.
3. Aspirate the mTeSR Plus culture medium and wash the cells with 1 ml of room temperature
 PBS. After aspirating the PBS, add 500 µl of pre-warmed Versene solution (or room
 temperature 0.5 mM EDTA) and incubate at 37 °C in an incubator for 5–6 min.

Nature Protocols 13

Protocol


4. After the incubation time is up, carefully observe the cell morphology under the
 microscope. Expect to see the light penetrating through the condense regions of
 the cells.
5. Once most of the well is bright, carefully aspirate the dissociation medium.
6. Using a P1000 pipette, use 1 ml of mTeSR Plus medium to gently detach the cells
 and break up hPSC colonies to small clusters. Then, transfer the cells to a 1.7-ml
 Eppendorf tube.
 ▲ CAUTION Gently pipette no more than five times, because the mechanical stress
 can induce spontaneous differentiation. It is normal to have clusters of cells with
 different sizes, which will not affect hPSC expansion.
7. In a new 1.7-ml Eppendorf tube, prepare 1 ml of mTeSR Plus for one well of a 12-well plate.
 Seed the cells at a 1:12 ratio to the newly prepared mTeSR.
8. Aspirate the Matrigel-coating medium from the well and add your passaged cells in
 mTeSR Plus to the well. Return to the incubator.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Once the cells have been plated, gently jolt the plate up and down and
 left and right to equally distribute the cells in each well.
9. Days 2–5. Starting on day 2 (where day 0 is the day of cell seeding in Step 8), change the
 medium every other day with fresh mTeSR Plus medium (no medium change is needed on
 day 1). Healthy hPSCs will reach a confluency of 80–90% 4–5 d after passage. This suggests
 that their cell proliferation rates are following the normal logarithmic growth. In addition,
 this indicates that the cells are ready to proceed for NPC differentiation.
10. Pretreat hPSCs with 1 ml of mTeSR Plus medium supplemented with 10 µM Y27632 for 1 h.
 Then, aspirate the medium and wash the cells with 1 ml of PBS.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP This pretreatment step can inhibit cell death of hPSCs in single-cell
 passaging.
11. Aspirate 1 ml of PBS and add 0.5 ml of Accumax solution (pre-warmed to 37 °C) and put the
 plate in an incubator for 12–18 min. Every 3–4 min, take the plate out of the incubator and
 tap gently to facilitate hPSC dissociation. The dissociation is considered complete when
 most of the hPSCs are detached from the plate, with most of the floating hPSCs as either
 single cells or small clusters with fewer than five cells.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Complete dissociation of hPSCs into single cells is very important for
 accurate hPSC seeding, which will have significant effects on the efficiency of hPSC-to-iNPC
 differentiation.
12. After Accumax dissociation, add 0.5 ml of mTeSR Plus medium supplemented with 10 µM
 Y27632 to neutralize the digestion reaction. Now, the total volume of cell solution is ~1 ml.
13. Pipette up and down gently 10 times to break down the cell clusters into a single-cell
 solution.
14. Transfer the cell solution into one 1.7-ml tube and centrifuge at 300g for 5 min.
15. Aspirate the supernatant and use 1 ml of mTeSR Plus medium supplemented with 10 µM
 Y27632 to resuspend the cell pellet by pipetting gently up and down five to six times.
16. Count the cells with a TC20 automated cell counter.
17. Seed 40,000 hPSCs in one Matrigel-coated well of a 12-well plate with 1 ml of mTeSR Plus
 medium supplemented with 10 µM Y27632.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP An accurate initial hPSC seeding number is very critical for
 differentiation.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP It is important to add 10 µM Y27632 to increase the survival of the
 hPSCs during seeding.
18. 24 h after hPSC seeding, change the medium with 1 ml of fresh mTeSR Plus medium without
 Y27632.
19. Usually 2–3 d after hPSC seeding (designated as hPSC-to-iNPC differentiation ‘D0’ in Fig. 2a),
 the hPSC colonies are big enough in size to initiate iNPC differentiation.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP The size of hPSC colonies is critical for successful differentiation. If the
 hPSC colonies are too small, CHIR99021 will cause drastic cell death, leaving very few cells,
 and if the starting hPSC colonies are too big, the cells will overgrow and begin to peel off,
 resulting in failed differentiation.

 hPSC-to-iNPC differentiation and enrichment of iNPCs
 ● TIMING 10 d
 20. Day 0. Before initiating the differentiation, first aspirate the culture medium and wash with
 1 ml of PBS, before adding 1 ml of the phase I medium (Table 6).
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP The washing step with PBS is critical because mTeSR Plus medium
 contains growth factors (transforming growth factor-β1 and FGF2) that could potentially
 have some lingering side effects during differentiations.
 21. Days 2 and 3. Replace with 1.2 ml of fresh phase 1 medium.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Do not change the medium on day 1 with phase I medium. Excessive WNT
 signaling activation by CHIR99021 will induce dramatic cell death.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP After day 2, the medium will turn bright yellow overnight, indicating that
 the metabolic activity is high. It is important to change the medium on both day 2 and day 3.
 Otherwise, drastic cell death will lead to failed differentiation.

22. On day 4, aspirate the phase I medium and add 1.2 ml of phase II medium (Table 6).
23. Days 5 and 6. Renew the medium with 1.2 ml of fresh phase II medium.
 ▲ CAUTION If you note that the cells are starting to peel off the plate, it is best to
 discontinue and restart the differentiation, because it will just get worse over time.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
24. On day 7, aspirate the phase II medium and add 1.2 ml of phase III medium (Table 6).
25. Days 8 and 9. Renew the medium with 1.2 ml of fresh phase III medium.
26. Day 10. Observe the cells under a microscope. iNPCs on day 10 of differentiation should
 exhibit their signature cluster morphology in which they condense together and show
 bright SIX2-GFP (Fig. 2a,b). The differentiated cells are now ready for dissociation and FACS
 to purify the iNPCs.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
27. Day 10. Aspirate the phase III medium and gently wash the cells with 1 ml of PBS.
28. Remove PBS, add 0.5 ml of Accumax (pre-warmed to 37 °C) into the well and then put the
 plate in a 37 °C incubator for 12 min. 6 min after the incubation, remove the plate from the
 incubator and tap the plate to help the cells detach and better dissociate.
29. After Accumax dissociation, add 0.5 ml of 10% (vol/vol) FBS medium to neutralize the
 dissociation reaction and pipette up and down gently 10 times to break down the cell
 clusters into single cells.
30. Transfer the cell solution into a 1.7-ml tube and centrifuge at 300g for 5 min.
31. If using cells with an NPC-specific reporter such as the SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry dual
 reporter, follow option A. For iNPC line derivation from hPSC lines that have no NPC-
 specific reporters for FACS, follow option B. Alternatively, if there are large populations of
 off-target cells after hPSC-to-iNPC differentiation, follow option C to sort for cell surface
 marker ITGA8 via FACS.
 (A) FACS with an NPC-specific reporter
 (i) Remove the supernatant. Use a P1000 pipette to add 1 ml of FACS medium
 containing 0.33 µl of Hoechst 33342 at a ratio of 1:3,000 (serving as a viability
 marker for FACS) and resuspend the cell pellet by pipetting up and down gently
 three to five times.
 (ii) Filter the cell solution through a strainer cap of a Falcon round-bottom tube.
 (iii) FACS of iNPCs through BD FACSAria III cell sorter. For the SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry
 dual reporter hPSC line, GFP+;mCherry+ iNPCs are sorted as shown in Fig. 2c.
 See also Supplementary Fig. 1a for an example of full FACS gating plots.
 (B) No NPC-specific reporter
 (i) Remove the supernatant. Use a P1000 pipette to add 1 ml of hNPSR-v2 medium
 and resuspend the cell pellet by pipetting up and down gently three to five times.
 (ii) Count the cells with a TC20 automated cell counter and seed 120,000 cells into
 one well of a 12-well plate coated with Matrigel and culture in hNPSR-v2 medium.
 hNPSR-v2 medium will further expand and enrich the iNPC population (~90% SIX2+)
 over two to three passages by repeating Steps 34–41.
 (C) FACS for ITGA8
 (i) Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 200 µl of FACS medium
 with 2 µl of primary antibody against ITGA8 (1:100 dilution of the ITGA8 antibody).
 (ii) Incubate the cells with ITGA8 antibody at 4 °C for 1 h.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP It is critical to incubate for 1 h but not for a shorter time.
 (iii) After incubation, centrifuge at 300g for 5 min to pellet the cells, then remove the
 supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 500 µl of FACS medium.
 (iv) Centrifuge at 300g for 5 min to pellet the cells and then resuspend the cell pellet in
 300 µl of FACS medium containing 0.3 µl of secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat
 IgG (H+L) cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 647). Incubate the cells
 with the secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C protected from light.
 (v) After incubation, centrifuge at 300g for 5 min to pellet the cells, then remove the
 supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 500 µl of FACS medium.

 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING

iNPC expansion in hNPSR-v2 medium and passaging
● TIMING 4 d
32. Day 0. If continuing after FACS (Step 31A or C), count the cells with a TC20 automated
 cell counter and seed ~120,000 cells per well to one Matrigel-coated well of a 12-well plate
 with 1 ml of hNPSR-v2 medium. (From our experiences, FACS from one well of a 12-well
 plate can lead to the isolation of 200,000–300,000 SIX2+ iNPCs. Please scale up or down
 as needed.)
33. Return the cultures to the incubator. Typically, it takes 4 d for each sorted iNPC passage
 cycle at the split ratio of 1:10 (Fig. 3a). (From our experiences, a confluent well of a 12-well
 plate can produce 1–1.5 million iNPCs.)
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
34. Day 1. Observe iNPCs under the microscope to ensure that the cells are attached to the
 plate. It is common to find dead cells floating, which is normal from FACS. No medium
 change is needed.
35. Day 2. Change the medium to 1 ml of fresh hNPSR-v2 medium.
36. Day 4. Observe iNPCs under the microscope to check confluence. iNPCs should have
 reached 80–90% confluence and will be ready for passaging or cryopreservation
 (D4 in Fig. 3a).
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Some iNPC lines might grow faster. On day 3, if the medium turns yellow,
 change the medium with fresh hNPSR-v2 medium.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP iNPC overgrowth (>100% confluency) leads to dramatic cell death and
 decreased iNPC quality.
37. Aspirate the used hNPSR-v2 medium and wash the cells with 1 ml of PBS.
38. Remove PBS, add 0.5 ml of Accumax and incubate at 37 °C for 8 min.
39. After Accumax dissociation, add 0.5 ml of 10% (vol/vol) FBS medium to neutralize the
 dissociation reaction and gently pipette up and down three to five times to mix the cells.
 Continue to Step 40 to maintain iNPCs in culture. Alternatively:
 • To cryopreserve cells, proceed to Step 42.
 • To characterize the iNPC line, proceed to Step 45.
 • To generate nephron organoids, proceed to Step 53.
40. Transfer the 1-ml single-cell suspension into a 1.7-ml Eppendorf tube, take 100 µl (1:10 ratio)
 to another 1.7-ml tube and then centrifuge at 300g for 5 min.
41. Remove the supernatant from the tube with 100 µl of cells and use 1 ml of hNPSR-v2 medium
 to resuspend the iNPC pellet. Seed the cells into one Matrigel-coated well of a 12-well plate
 and repeat the passaging steps (Steps 34–41) for long-term culture.
 • Note that if no NPC-specific reporter was used and cells were not enriched by FACS
 (Step 31B), the passaging steps must be repeated two to three times to enrich the
 iNPC population.

iNPC cryopreservation
● TIMING 1 d
42. 200,000–1,000,000 cells can be frozen in 0.5 ml of Bambanker cell freezing medium per
 cryovial (1.5-ml Nalgene SYSTEM 100 cryogenic vial). To do so, after Step 39, first count
 the total number of cells harvested.
43. Then, calculate the number of cryovials needed on the basis of the total number of cells.
 Centrifuge the cells at 300g for 5 min, resuspend the cell pellet with an appropriate
 volume of Bambanker cell freezing medium and distribute a 0.5-ml aliquot of the
 cell suspension in each cryovial. As an example, if the counted total cell number is

 and then distribute a 0.5-ml aliquot per cryovial, leaving a total of 10 cryovials with
 200,000 cells each.
44. Transfer the cryovials into a −80 °C freezer.
 ■ PAUSE POINT The cells can be stored at – 80 °C for ≤1 year. For long-term storage,
 transfer the cryovials from the −80 °C freezer to a liquid nitrogen tank.

Protocol


Characterization of the iNPC line by using immunostaining
● TIMING 1 d
45. iNPC quality can be regularly checked by using immunostaining every four to five passages
 (2–3 weeks). For that, after dissociating the cells (Step 39), count the cell density and
 seed 100,000 cells into one 1.7-ml Eppendorf tube and then centrifuge at 300g for 5 min.
 Resuspend the pellet with 100 µl of hNPSR-v2 medium and seed into one well of a Matrigel-
 coated 96-well plate. Scale up if multiple wells are needed for immunostaining. On the
 next day, these cells will attach to the plate and are ready for immunofluorescence staining
 directly in the 96-well plate.
46. Aspirate the culture medium and add 50 µl of 4% PFA (wt/vol) aqueous solution to fix the
 cells for 10 min at room temperature.
 ▲ CAUTION Formaldehyde and PFA are moderately acutely toxic by all routes of exposure,
 but the more concerning health hazards in a workplace setting are the chronic health
 hazards arising from them being carcinogens, mutagens and potent sensitizers. 4% PFA
 must be handled in a fume hood.
47. Aspirate the 4% PFA fixative from the well and wash the well with 100 µl of PBS three times.
48. Aspirate the PBS after the last wash and add 100 µl of blocking buffer for 20 min.
49. Aspirate the blocking buffer, add 60 µl of blocking buffer containing the desired primary
 antibodies and incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Information on our commonly used
 and validated antibodies for NPC characterization and their dilution ratios is listed in
 Table 1.
50. Aspirate the primary antibody solution and add 100 µl of PBST to wash the well three times.
51. Aspirate the PBST after the last wash, add 60 µl of blocking buffer containing the desired
 secondary antibodies and incubate for 30 mins at room temperature.
52. Aspirate the secondary antibody solution and then wash the well with 100 µl of PBST three
 times. The samples are now ready for imaging by using epifluorescence microscopy or
 confocal microscopy of choice. A high-quality iNPC line should display >90% positivity for
 all the marker genes listed in Table 1 except for PAX2, which will decrease over passages as
 described in our original publication28 (Fig. 3b,c).

Generation of nephron organoids from hNPSR-v2-cultured iNPCs
● TIMING 22 d
53. Day −1. After dissociation to single cells (Steps 37–39), count the cells by using the TC20
 automated cell counter.
54. Centrifuge at 300g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with
 an appropriate volume of hNPSR-v2 medium so that each 100 µl of medium contains
 25,000–30,000 iNPCs.
55. Seed ~25,000–30,000 iNPCs into one well of a 96-well U-bottom low-attachment plate in
 100 µl of hNPSR-v2 medium and then centrifuge the plate at 300g for 5 min.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP We suggest adding PBS to the outer boundary wells of the 96-well
 U-bottom plate to minimize evaporation.
56. After centrifugation, place the plate in the incubator to allow the cells to aggregate
 overnight.
57. Day 0. The iNPC aggregates are transferred to the membrane of a Transwell for air–liquid
 interface culture. First, in a six-well Transwell plate, add 1 ml of phase I medium (Table 7) to
 the bottom chamber of each well. The other unused Transwell inserts from the Transwell
 plate can be transferred to another regular sterile six-well cell culture plate for future use.
58. To transfer the aggregates without compromising their spherical structure, cut the tip
 of a P200 pipette tip to carefully pick up and place the iNPC aggregates on the Transwell
 membrane.
59. Use a new uncut P200 pipette tip to carefully pipette out the surrounding medium that
 lingered from the transfer so that the aggregates can attach to the membrane.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP We recommend placing no more than six iNPC aggregates onto each well
 of a Transwell membrane to ensure enough space and medium nutrients for the nephron
 organoids to develop.

Nature Protocols 19

Protocol


60. Place the Transwell plate in the incubator for 1 h. After 1 h, remove the phase I medium and
 directly add 1 ml of phase II medium (Table 7) into the bottom chamber of the Transwell plate.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP It is critical to remove most of the phase I medium, because residual
 CHIR99021 could have some detrimental side effects to the iNPC aggregates. When
 removing the phase I medium, carefully lift up the Transwell insert and aspirate the well
 and the bottom area of the membrane without damaging the membrane.
61. Days 2 and 4. Change the medium with 1 ml of fresh phase II medium.
62. Day 5. Remove the phase II medium and add 1 ml of phase III medium (Table 7) into the
 bottom chamber of the Transwell plate.
63. Days 7–19. Starting on day 7, change the medium with 1 ml of fresh phase III medium every
 other day. Note the dramatic morphological changes as nephron organoids develop
 (Fig. 4a). Specifically, look for the formation of RV/comma-shaped body/SSB-like structures
 in the organoids from days 5–8 (Fig. 4a,b) and the formation of tubule-like structures from
 days 12–21, indicating further nephron development (Fig. 4a,c).
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
64. Day 21. Harvest the iNPC-derived nephron organoids for various assays to characterize the
 organoids (Step 65).
 • Note that iNPC-derived nephron organoids can be harvested for various assays at any
 time point of the differentiation for different purposes. Extended organoid culture
 in phase III medium beyond day 21 is not recommended. The organoids might be
 unhealthy after day 21.

Characterization for iNPC-derived nephron organoids
● TIMING 2 d
65. At the end of phase III (day 21), iNPC-derived nephron organoids are ready for
 characterization: follow option A for immunofluorescence staining and option B to prepare
 samples for RT-qPCR.
 (A) Immunofluorescence staining
 (i) To prepare samples for immunostaining, remove the Transwell insert from the
 six-well plate and peel the whole Transwell membrane off by using fine forceps
 (organoids should stay on the top of the membrane).
 (ii) Use a blade or fine scissors to cut the Transwell membrane into smaller pieces
 (~5 mm), with each piece containing one organoid in the center.
 (iii) Use forceps to transfer each Transwell membrane piece with an organoid into one
 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 200 µl of 10% (vol/vol) FBS medium.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP It is important to use a solution containing FBS to transfer the
 organoids. When basal medium without FBS or PBS is used, organoids can stick
 to the Eppendorf tube, leading to loss of samples.
 (iv) Aspirate the 10% (vol/vol) FBS medium and add 200 µl of 4% PFA (wt/vol) for
 fixation at room temperature for 12 min.
 (v) Aspirate the 4% PFA and wash the organoid with 500 µl of PBS three times.
 (vi) Aspirate the PBS after the last wash. Add 500 µl of blocking buffer and incubate
 for 30 min at room temperature.
 (vii) Aspirate the blocking buffer and add 200 µl of blocking buffer containing the
 desired primary antibodies for incubation overnight at 4 °C. Information on our
 commonly used and validated antibodies for nephron organoid characterization
 and their dilution ratios is listed in Table 2.
 (viii) Aspirate the primary antibody solution and add 500 µl of PBST to wash the well
 three times.
 (ix) Aspirate the PBST after the last wash and add 200 µl of blocking buffer containing
 the desired secondary antibodies for incubation overnight at 4 °C.
 (x) Aspirate the secondary antibody solution and then wash the well with 500 µl of
 PBST three to five times.
 (xi) Use forceps to hold the Transwell membrane piece and transfer the piece with
 an organoid onto a microscope slide.

 (xii) Remove excessive PBST and then add ~20 µl of mounting medium.
 (xiii) Carefully place a microscope coverslip on the sample (avoid bubble formation).
 Note, the coverslip may flatten the organoid, but it will not compromise its
 3D structure.
 (xiv) Seal the sample with clear nail polish surrounding the coverslip. The sample is now
 ready for imaging by using epifluorescence microscopy or confocal microscopy.
 iNPC-derived nephron organoids should display NPHS1+/NPHS2+/PODXL+/MAFB+
 podocytes, LTL+/LRP2+/HNF4A+ proximal tubules, SLC12A1+ loops of Henle and
 POU3F3+/CDH1+ distal nephrons.
 (B) Preparing samples for RT-qPCR
 (i) For preparing samples for RT-qPCR to determine mature podocyte marker gene
 expression, detach organoids from the Transwell membrane by using fine needles.
 (ii) Cut 5 mm from a P1000 pipette tip to make a wide opening for the pipette tip.
 (iii) Wet the detached organoids (still on the Transwell membrane but detached) with
 10% (vol/vol) FBS medium and transfer the organoids to an Eppendorf tube with
 10% (vol/vol) FBS medium.
 (iv) Aspirate as much of the residual 10% (vol/vol) FBS medium as possible during
 transfer. Then, proceed with standard RNA extraction by using any commercial kit
 of choice, followed by RT-qPCR following the suppliers’ instructions. Our validated
 RT-qPCR primers (SYBR green based) for mature podocyte genes are listed in
 Table 3. The representative data are shown in Fig. 4d.

Timing

Steps 1–19, hPSC passaging and expansion in preparation for hPSC-to-iNPC differentiation: 9 d
Steps 20–31, hPSC-to-iNPC differentiation and purification of iNPCs: 10 d
Steps 32–44, iNPC expansion in hNPSR-v2 medium, passaging and cryopreservation: 5 d
Steps 45–52, characterization of the iNPC line: 1 d
Steps 53–64, generation of nephron organoids from cultured iNPCs: 22 d
Step 65, characterization of nephron organoids: 2 d


Anticipated results

This protocol has been used to successfully derive iNPC lines from a diverse source of hPSC
lines with or without NPC-specific reporter systems28, including hPSC lines bearing SIX2-GFP
only or SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry, reporters from the H1 hESC parental line and MAFB-GFP46
from the H9 hESC parental line. Multiple laboratory personnel from our laboratory and our
collaborators’ laboratories have been able to successfully execute the protocol, demonstrating
its high reproducibility.
 After the 10-d hPSC-to-iNPC differentiation protocol, on days 9–10, formation of
morphologically distinct condensed NPC clusters can serve as a strong indicator of successful
iNPC induction (Fig. 2a,b). When SIX2-GFP;PAX2-mCherry or SIX2-GFP reporter hPSC lines are
used, these condensed NPC clusters will show bright SIX2-GFP, indicating their NPC identity
(Fig. 2a,b). On day 10 of differentiation, typically 10–20% of the cells are SIX2-GFP+;PAX2mCherry+ iNPCs on the basis of FACS (Fig. 2c,d). FACS from cells differentiated in one well of
a 12-well plate can lead to the isolation of 200,000–300,000 iNPCs. These purified iNPCs are
collected and cultured in hNPSR-v2 medium for expansion. Upon expansion, one confluent
well of a 12-well plate can produce 1–1.5 million iNPCs.


Nature Protocols 23

Protocol


 iNPCs can be expanded in hNPSR-v2 medium for >3 months. Typically, iNPCs are passaged
once every 4–5 d at a ratio of 1 to 10 (Fig. 3a). iNPCs show mesenchymal cell morphologies and
show uniform expression of several key NPC marker genes, such as SIX2, PAX2, SALL1, WT1, ITGA8
and YAP by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3b,c). Bulk RNA-seq analysis indicates that gene
expression of the iNPCs is similar to that of primary human NPCs from human fetal kidneys47,48
(Fig. 3d). Immunostaining is recommended as a simple and reliable quality control assay to
determine iNPC quality in culture every two to three passages. Except for a gradual decrease in
PAX2 expression over time, the expression of SIX2, SALL1, WT1 and ITGA8 should be consistent in
the iNPCs all the time in hNPSR-v2 culture. Expanded iNPCs not only display uniform expression
of several NPC marker genes as revealed by immunofluorescence staining, but also resemble
primary human NPCs in transcriptomes based on bulk RNA-seq analysis28.
 Dramatic morphological changes are expected during nephron organoid formation from
iNPCs on an air–liquid interface. Around differentiation days 5–8, hundreds of epithelialized RV
structures are formed in the organoids, indicative of successful MET and initiation of nephron
induction (Fig. 4a). RV structures continue to self-organize into SSBs (Fig. 4b) and nephron
structures showing the expression of podocyte markers PODXL1 and NPHS2, proximal tubule
marker LRP2 (localized on the apical side of the tubule lumen), loop of Henle marker SLC12A1
(localized on the apical side of the tubule lumen) and distal nephron marker CDH1 (Fig. 4a,c).
Single-cell multiome (10X Genomics) analysis confirmed the generation of various nephron cell
types and indicated a biased generation of a dominant podocyte population in the iNPC-derived
organoids compared to standard hPSC-derived nephron organoids (Fig. 4e,g). These podocytes
show decreased expression of immature podocyte markers and dramatically increased mature
podocyte markers (e.g., COL4A3 and COL4A4) (Fig. 4d,f), with these mature marker genes’ open
chromatin status similar to that of an adult kidney’s podocytes (Fig. 4h). For quality control,
we recommend two checkpoints during differentiation: (i) the formation of morphologically
distinct RV and SSB structures 5–8 d after initiation of differentiation and (ii) the formation
of major nephron segments revealed by immunostaining at the end point of organoid
differentiation. To determine podocyte maturity, RT-qPCR can be used to confirm late podocyte
marker gene expression (Fig. 4d and Table 3). Long-term cultured iNPCs (>3 months) still retain
robust nephrogenic potential to differentiate into different nephron segments28.

Methodology
 Sample preparation Differentiated hPSCs were dissociated into single cells with Accumax, and then resuspended with FACS medium (2% FBS in
 PBS), and then cell solution went through 40um cell strainer (Greiner bio-one, Cat. No. 542040), next the samples were ready
 for FACS analysis.

 Instrument BD FACSAria IIIu instrument was used for sorting (100 uM nozzle was used and 20 psi pressure was applied).

 Software FACS Vantage (Aria II and FACS Jazz).

 Cell population abundance We determined the relevant cell population based on cell surface markers after gating on the Pax2-mCherry/SIX2-GFP/ITGA8
 positive cell population from differentiated hPSCs population. Each cell population is presented as % of differentiated hPSCs;
 SIX2+/PAX2+ iNPCs (30%), ITGA8+ iNPC (51.8%).

 Gating strategy Gating strategies are clearly described in the figure legends. Basically, live cells were gated with FCS and SSC and
 subsequently gated with various markers as indicated in the figures.
