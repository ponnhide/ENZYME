67 Prepare fibronectin-coated six-well plates as described in ‘Reagent setup’.
68 Prepare 15 ml of complete SFD medium as described in ‘Reagent setup’.
69 Prepare 50 ml of Anteriorization medium-1 as described in ‘Reagent setup’.
CRITICAL STEP Prepare the medium fresh on the day of use.

70 Swirl the ultralow-attachment plate of EBs (from Step 45) slowly to make the EBs concentrate in the middle of the wells.
71 Gently collect all the remaining EBs from the plate and pool in a 15 ml conical tube by a P1000 pipette.
72 Allow the EBs to settle down for 5 min or centrifuge the conical tube at 130g for 1 min to pellet down the EBs.
73 Aspirate the medium.
74 Dissociate the EBs into single cells with 3 ml of trypsin.
75 Gently tap the tube to swirl the EBs in the trypsin/EDTA solution.
76 Neutralize the enzymes with 10 ml Stop medium.
77 Pellet the dissociated cells by centrifugation at 400g for 4 min.
78 Aspirate the Stop medium.
79 Resuspend the cells in 10 ml of complete SFD medium.
80 Take 25 μl of cell mixture and mix with Trypan Blue and count the cell number using a hemocytometer.
81 Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 400g for 4 min.
82 Aspirate the complete SFD medium.
83 Resuspend the cells in Anteriorization medium-1 (7.5 × 105 cells per 2 ml of Anteriorization medium-1).

84 Add 2 ml of cell mixture to each well of the fibronectin-coated six-well plate (from Step 67).

85 Rock the plate in a side-to-side motion to ensure that cells are evenly distributed.

87 On d6, after 24 h (±2 h) after adding the Anteriorization medium-1, prepare an appropriate amount of the Anteriorization medium-2 (2 ml per well) as described in ‘Reagent setup’.
CRITICAL STEP Prepare the medium fresh on the day of use.

89 Return the plates to a normoxic incubator.

90 On d6, 24 h (± 2 h) after adding the Anteriorization medium-2, prepare an appropriate amount of the ventralization medium/branching medium (2 ml per well) as described in ‘Reagent setup’.
CRITICAL STEP Prepare the medium fresh on the day of use.

91 Replace the Anteriorization medium-2 with ventralization medium/branching medium (2 ml per well).
92 Return the plates to a normoxic incubator.
93 On d8, 48 h later, prepare an appropriate amount of the ventralization medium/branching medium (2 ml per well) as described in ‘Reagent setup’.
94 Aspirate all the old ventralization medium/branching medium and add 2 ml fresh ventralization medium/branching medium to each well.
95 Suspend the organoids by gently pipetting up and down with P1000 tips.
96 Transfer the suspended organoids to six-well ultralow-attachment plates (one well to one well).
97 Rock the plate with a side-to-side motion to ensure that cells are evenly distributed.
98 Return the plate to a normoxic incubator.
99 On d10, feed the organoids by tilting the plate and allowing the organoids to sink to the bottom edge. Remove the old medium while avoiding touching the organoids. Add 2 ml freshly prepared ventralization medium/branching medium to each well. Feed the organoids with freshly prepared medium on the day of use every other day.
