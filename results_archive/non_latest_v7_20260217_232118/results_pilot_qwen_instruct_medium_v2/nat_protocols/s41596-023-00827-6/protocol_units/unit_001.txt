1 Remove the insert from the 24-well plate, invert it and gently peel off the membrane from the bottom of the insert using forceps.
2 Carefully place the insert with the membrane removed over the mouth of an open, empty 15 ml centrifuge tube.
3 Add 1 ml of cell recovery reagent to the insert such that the embedded organoid with Matrigel falls into the 15 ml centrifuge tube.
4 Close the 15 ml centrifuge tube and immediately place on ice to depolymerize the Matrigel.
5 Every 20 min, gently shake the tube to check if the Matrigel has dissolved and place it back on ice.
6 Once the Matrigel has dissolved, add 10 ml of wash medium to the tube. Time varies from ~45 min to 1 h depending on Matrigel thickness.
7 Centrifuge at 200g for 5 min.
8 Aspirate the wash medium and cell recovery reagent and add 1 ml of Accutase to the organoid and incubate at 37 °C.
CRITICAL STEP Avoid using trypsin to dissociate the organoid as it is too harsh and the chances of losing fragile cell types is higher.

9 Gently shake the tube to disturb/dissociate the organoid every 5 min and replace the tube at 37 °C for 10–12 min. Time varies depending on the organoid size and density.
10 When the organoid is dissociated add 10 ml wash medium and centrifuge at 400g for 4 min.
11 Aspirate the wash medium and resuspend the pellet in base medium.
CRITICAL STEP Check the base medium compatibility with the sequencing technology to be used for scRNAseq.

12 Remove dead cells from the cell suspension by using the MiltenyiBiotec dead cell removal kit.
13 Dilute the cell suspension to a concentration of 5,000 cells/μl for sequencing. For sequencing and analysis of scRNAseq data, see Box 3.
CRITICAL STEP Cell suspension dilution varies depending on the sequencing vendor requirements.
