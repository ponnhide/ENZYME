Validation of KO efficiency
85. PCR amplification. To validate KO efficiency, amplify the genomic DNA (gDNA) by using primers flanking the sgRNA target sites. Because three sgRNAs were used per candidate gene (Fig. 4a), we expect the KO cells to exhibit segmental deletions. As a result, PCR amplification from KO cells will produce a smaller amplicon. In cases of high KO efficiency, only the smaller KO band is detected (Fig. 4b).
86. NGS sequencing of the target gene. For a detailed analysis of mutation types generated by the KO, subject the PCR amplicon to NGS. In scenarios with high KO efficiency, only a small fraction of PCR amplicons originate from control cells (Fig. 4c–e).
87. Western blotting. To confirm the KO at the protein level, perform western blotting to assess the expression of the protein encoded by the target gene. In cases in which KO efficiency is high, minimal or no protein expression is observed, with only trace amounts potentially originating from control cells (Fig. 4f–h).
