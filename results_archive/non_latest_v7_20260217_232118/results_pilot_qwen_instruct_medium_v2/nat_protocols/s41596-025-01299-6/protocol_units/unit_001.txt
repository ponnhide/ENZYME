Day 0: preparation of hiPS cells for transduction
● TIMING 2 h
1. Coat six-well plates with diluted vitronectin solution (1:100 dilution with DPBS, 1 ml per well) and incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 h. Aspirate vitronectin just before transferring the cell suspension to the well.
2. Aspirate culture medium from the hiPS cells cultured in six-well plates and rinse with 1 ml of DPBS. Add 1 ml of Accutase and incubate at 37 °C for 7 min in a 5% CO2 incubator. At the end of the 7 min, the cells should be easily detached from the plate with gentle shaking.
◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
3. Add 1 ml of pre-warmed E8 medium per well to the cells and collect the suspensions into 15-ml conical tubes. Gently pipette the cell suspension a few times with a serological pipette to ensure that any remining clumps are fully dissociated. Centrifuge the samples at 200g for 5 min.
