Day 75: sorting the migrated and leftover Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells
● TIMING depends on the number of samples to process
44. Transfer one hFA into a 10-cm dish. Aspirate the medium as much as possible.
45. Align the assembloid with the hCO on the left and the hSO on the right (Fig. 3i). Use a fluorescence microscope to confirm the identity of the hSO by checking the hFA, as the hSO should show many Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells.
46. Carefully separate the two organoids at the boundary of the fusion with tweezers or scissors.
47. Collect the hCO and hSO into separate dishes with NM. Save the samples in the incubator until the next step.
48. Repeat this process for the rest of the hFA.
49. Pool eight organoids per well and then proceed with dissociation. A few control hSO (uninfected) should be dissociated at this step to be used as a negative control for FACS.
50. Remove the extra medium from each well and add 3 ml of enzyme solution with papain (30 U ml−1) to the well. Incubate the samples at 37 °C for 45 min in a 5% CO2 incubator. Gently swirl the plate every 15 min to evenly distribute the enzyme solution.
▲ CRITICAL STEP Before dissociation, equilibrate the enzyme solution with an appropriate amount of papain at 37 °C for 20 min to activate the enzyme.
51. After digestion with the enzyme solution, transfer the sample and enzyme solution to a 15-ml conical tube.
52. Centrifuge the 15-ml conical tube for 30 s at 200g. After centrifugation, remove the supernatant and add 1 ml of low-ovo solution. Centrifuge the 15-ml conical tube for 30 s at 200g. Wash one more time with 1 ml of low-Ovo solution and then add 1 ml of low-ovo solution to the sample.
53. Mechanically dissociate the organoids by pipetting a few times with a P1000 tip. After pipetting, no large chunks of cells should be visible. Transfer ~800 μl of the supernatant to a new 15-ml conical tube.
54. Pipette the remaining cell chunks a few times with a P200 tip and transfer ~180 μl of the supernatant to the same conical tube. Finally, pipette a few times with a P20 tip to break the leftover debris and transfer the supernatant to the same 15-ml conical tube.
55. Carefully layer 1 ml of high-ovo solution underneath the cell suspension.
56. Centrifuge the 15-ml conical tube for 5 min at 200g to pellet the cells.
57. After centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant and then resuspend the pelleted cells in 1 ml of 3% BSA (wt/vol) diluted in 1× DPBS supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.
58. Filter the cells through a 50-μm pore filter into a 15-ml low-binding tube.
59. Isolate Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells through FACS. Use the cells dissociated from control hSO as a negative control to set the FACS gate. Conduct FACS at 4 °C and place the collected cells in a low-binding 15-ml conical tube containing 5 ml of NM supplemented with 10% FBS (vol/vol) and 20 μM Y-27632.
60. Collect Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells from the separated hSO and hCO. We were able to process ~100 hFA in a day.
▲ CRITICAL STEP It is crucial to collect a sufficient number of cells. Perform a test to determine the number of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells that can be obtained via FACS from a specific number of hFA. Use this information to decide how many hFA will be needed for the experiment.
