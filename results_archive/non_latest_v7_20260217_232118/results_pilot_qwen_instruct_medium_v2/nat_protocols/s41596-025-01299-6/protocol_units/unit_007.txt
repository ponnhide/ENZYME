Days 46–49: generation of hFA by integrating hSO with hCO
● TIMING 4 d
▲ CRITICAL Prepare hCO from control hiPS cells in advance (Box 1). We fused day-61 hCO with day-46 hSO.
40. Transfer one hCO and one hSO into the same well of a 24-well low-attachment plate by using the P1000 pipette tips with wide orifice. Fill each well with 2 ml of NM. Tilt the plate slightly to guide both organoids toward the edge of the well. Using a P20 pipette tip, gently position the hCO and hSO so that they are in contact with each other (Fig. 3f).
41. Once the assembloids are set up across the entire plate, carefully transfer the plate to a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2, ensuring that the plate remains tilted (Fig. 3g). Keep the plates in the tilted position for 4 d without disturbing them.
▲ CRITICAL STEP It is important to keep the hFA undisturbed for the first 4 d after fusion to successfully generate hFA. We achieved a 100% success rate while generating 1,008 assembloids.
