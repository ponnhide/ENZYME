11. After samples have finished spinning, discard the supernatant by pouring out the liquid into a waste container.
▲ Critical step Do not aspirate the supernatant during the cell dissociation and digestion, as the cell pellet may be aspirated and lost.
12. Add 1 mL of HBSS/BSA/glucose and 50 µL of pre-aliquoted DNase (10 mg/mL) into each sample tube.
13. Gently mix/resuspend 50 times using a micropipette, taking care not to introduce bubbles, which may detrimentally affect the cells49.
14. Obtain two additional 15 mL conical tubes per each sample tube. For example, for three sample digestion tubes, obtain six tubes for Percoll filtration.
▲ Critical step Yield will be compromised if each digestion is not distributed into two Percoll tubes.
15. Dispense 4 mL of 22% Percoll into each new conical tube.
