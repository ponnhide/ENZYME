7. Distribute tissue into three 15 mL conical tubes.
 • Aliquot the tissue–buffer solution in the dish into the tubes first
 • Use extra HBSS/BSA/glucose buffer to wash the dish and make up to 5 mL per tube
8. Add 167 µL of collagenase/dispase (100 mg/mL) to each tube. Please note, 167 µL of collagenase/dispase per 5 mL is equivalent to 33.4 µL of solution per 1 mL.
