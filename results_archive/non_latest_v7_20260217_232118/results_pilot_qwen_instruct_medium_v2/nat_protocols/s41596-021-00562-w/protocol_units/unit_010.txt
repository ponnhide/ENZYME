29 Bend a 1,000 µl pipette tip by pressing down the pipette tip on the inside of the cap for the conical tube. Use this bent tip to pipette the Matrigel suspension 25 times if organoids are in the first passage after thawing. Otherwise pipette the Matrigel suspension 50 times. After resuspension, check the level of organoid fragmentation under an inverted microscope. If further dissociation is needed, return conical tube to ice in the biosafety cabinet, continue pipetting with bent pipette tip 25 more times and reexamine under the microscope. Repeat until mostly fragments remain.
