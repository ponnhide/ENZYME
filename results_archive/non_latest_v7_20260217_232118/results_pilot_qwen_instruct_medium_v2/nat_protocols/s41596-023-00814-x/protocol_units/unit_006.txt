10 Coat Superfrost slides with PLL: dilute 0.1% PLL solution 1:10 in distilled water. Soak glass slides for 5 min in 0.01% PLL at RT. Remove slides from the solution and dry for 2–3 h at RT.
PAUSE POINT Store dried slides in a box at RT for up to 3 months.

11 Set up the cryosection machine (for example, Cryostat) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We recommend that the chamber and holder’s temperature is 20–25 °C, and the cutting thickness is 12–16 µm. Perform sectioning: place the specimen into the cryostat holder and use the trimming mode until the OVB organoid is seen (faint beige with black dots). Stop trimming and set up the cutting thickness between 12 and 16 µm, cut and place sections on the PLL precoated Superfrost slides. For this, keep the slides at RT, cut and then pick up the section with the RT warm slide. The frozen section will easily stick to the warm glass slide. Check for the correct orientation of the pigmented area. Let sections dry for 1 h at RT. Store cryosections at −80 °C until continuing the procedure, with a minimum of 2 h or long-term storage.
PAUSE POINT Samples can be stored for up to 1 year at −80 °C.
