1 Collect up to ﬁve OVB organoids on day 30 or day 60 in a sterile 1 ml tube. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for transferring organoids.
2 Remove any carried-over medium carefully with a 200 µl micropipette tip without disturbing the organoids.
3 Wash organoids once with 1 ml of DMEM/F12 (prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath) for 3 min and remove the DMEM/F12.
4 Add 1 ml PFA (prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath) and incubate the tube at RT for 30–60 min.
CRITICAL STEP Do not exceed the time of PFA ﬁxation above 1 h since this will lead to high autoﬂuorescence. Use with 37 °C water bath warmed PFA to ﬁx the organoids to enhance penetration of PFA and preserve the cytoskeleton of the cells, since cold treatment leads to depolymerization of microtubules.
