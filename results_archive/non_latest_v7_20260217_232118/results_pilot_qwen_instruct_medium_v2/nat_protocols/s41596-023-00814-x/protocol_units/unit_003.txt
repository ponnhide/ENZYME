10 Aspirate the PBS-Glycine after the third time washing and add 500 µl of permeabilization solution. Incubate for 10 min at RT.
11 Aspirate the permeabilzation solution and wash three times with 500 µl PBS-Glycine.
12 Aspirate the PBS-Glycine after the third time of washing and add 500 µl of blocking solution.
PAUSE POINT Store plate at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks wrapped with Paraﬁlm to prevent evaporation and drying out of the ﬁxed cells, or proceed with the immunostaining after 1 h incubation at RT with blocking solution.
13 Dilute the ﬁrst primary antibody as recommended, for example, OCT4 in blocking buffer. Recommended markers to check for pluripotency of human iPSCs are OCT4 (POU5F1), Nanog, SSEA4, Tra-1-60 and/or Tra-1-81.
14 Aspirate the blocking solution and add 200 µl of antibody dilution into a well. Incubate at RT for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C in a refrigerator or cold room.
15 Aspirate the primary antibody dilution and wash three times with 500 µl of blocking solution.
16 Aspirate the blocking solution after the third washing step and add 500 µl of secondary antibody dilution (for details, see antibody table). Incubate for 1 h at RT and protect from light.
CRITICAL Keep plate in the dark from now on because secondary antibodies are light sensitive and will bleach out, resulting in signal loss later.
17 Aspirate the secondary antibody dilution and wash three times with blocking solution.
18 Repeat steps 14–18 for the next primary and secondary antibodies. Add 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) or Hoechst 33342 dye (both Life technologies) at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1–0.5 µg/ml or 1–5 µg/ml, respectively, for nuclear staining to the last secondary antibody incubation.
