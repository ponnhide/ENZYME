1 Transfer 60-d-old organoids each to one well of a suspension culture 12-well plate. Add 2 ml of OVB-organoid medium per well.
2 Keep the plate in absolute darkness at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h before ERG experiments.
3 On the day of the ERG experiment, prepare fresh OVB organoid medium in 50 ml centrifuge tubes. Oxygenate the OVB organoid medium by pumping air onto the bottom of the centrifuge tube with a sterile 10 ml serological pipette for 2 min under the clean bench.
4 Keep the room where you handle OVB organoids and perform the ERG experiment absolutely dark. Use a red light (e.g., from the western blot developing room) as the sole light source. If required, use an opaque box to transport OVB organoids from one dark room to another.
5 Set up the ERG aperture and ﬁll the superfusion system with an oxygenated OVB medium81.
6 Place organoids under red light in an electrode chamber.
7 Place electrode chamber into the dark chamber of the ERG aperture and connect it to the superfusion system containing oxygenated OVB medium.
8 Set up the speed of superfusion to 0.5 ml/min.
Dose-dependent light sensitivity
9 For dose-dependent light sensitivity, expose each organoid to 500 ms long ﬂashes. Start with a low intensity of 2,000 mlux (moonlight on a clear night), increase to 20,000 mlux (candle light) and then to 200,000 mlux (daylight on a cloudy day). Repeat each intensity three times at 3 min intervals, and then switch to the next higher light intensity. Record all responses.
