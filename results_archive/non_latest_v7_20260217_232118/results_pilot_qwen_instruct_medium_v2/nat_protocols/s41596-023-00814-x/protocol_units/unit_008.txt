CRITICAL Perform all steps under a clean bench.

1 Clean the micromanipulator with 70% ethanol (eEtOH) and place it under the clean bench.
2 Prepare ﬁne glass capillary pipettes (e.g., with DMZ Universal Electrode Puller). Check if the opening is still accessible by sucking and releasing DMEM/F12. Prepare at least four thin capillaries for each organoid since they break easily, and each dye requires a fresh, unused capillary.
3 Prepare 1:1 (vol/vol) dilutions CTB-488 or CTB-647 in DMEM/F12 in sterile 1.5 ml microtubes and protect them from light.
4 Place a 10 µl drop of Matrigel near an edge of a sterile glass slide and let the Matrigel solidify.
5 Collect OVB organoids of day 60 and place them on the Matrigel drop on the sterile glass slide. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for transferring organoids.
6 Remove excess medium carefully. Leave a thin ﬁlm or small drop of liquid around the organoid to ensure it does not dry out.
7 Place glass slide with organoids on the stage holder of a stereomicroscope under the clean bench.
8 Move the microinjector close to the organoids on the microscope stage holder.
9 Fill glass capillary tip with 3 µl of CTB-488 dilution (front ﬁll) and move the needle tip forward in front of the ﬁrst pigmented area. Inject the solution into the ﬁrst OV carefully, using a microscope. Try not to injure the OV or the surrounding tissue and avoid making air bubbles.
10 Move the microinjector tip backward and replace the tip with a new thin glass tip.
CRITICAL STEP Add one drop of OVB medium on the organoid to prevent it from drying out.
c
11 Fill glass pipette tip with 3 µl of CTB-647 dilution and repeat step 8 with the second pigmented area.
12 Transfer the injected organoids into a well of a 24-well plate for suspension culture and expose the plate to normal room light for 10 min.
13 After light exposure, culture the plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.
