3 Add 5 mL of DMEM/F12 to the flask, and rinse the flask bottom with the medium to detach the cells. Transfer the resulting cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube, and centrifuge the tube at 300g for 3 min at 4 °C.
4 Remove the supernatant, and gently resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of E8 + 10 μM Y27632.
