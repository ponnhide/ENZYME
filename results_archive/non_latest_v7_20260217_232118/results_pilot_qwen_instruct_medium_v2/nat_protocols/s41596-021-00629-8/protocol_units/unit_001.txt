1 Initiate monolayer culture using cells that have been maintained as colonies on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; option A) or, alternatively, from a frozen stock of monolayer-derived cells (option B). Both options should result in a similar HFO differentiation efficiency.
(A) Initiation of monolayer culture from hPSCs grown as colonies on MEFs ● Timing 20 min
(i) Obtain a six-well plate of high-quality hPSCs grown on MEFs (~80% confluency) in standard hPSC culture medium containing 20% KnockOut Serum Replacement (Fig. 3a). Dissociation of one well of the six-well plate should be sufficient to inoculate one T25 flask.
