Implementation of Quake-style microvalves22 to facilitate flow control during operation; the development of a machine-vision-based approach utilizing subsequent image subtraction for blob detection to move particles into the target region of interest with 95.9% of particles placed in a ~200-μm-wide region (Extended Data Fig. 1d); and the precise pressurization of the dropleting valve to enable accurate control of droplet volume (Extended Data Fig. 1e and Supplementary Video 1).
