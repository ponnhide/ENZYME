Given that DisCo requires a longer time period to process cells (for example, compared with the 10X Chromium instrument), we also assessed time-dependent effects on the quality of the single cell data by analyzing HEK 293T cells that were loaded on our system (at 22 °C (room temperature)) for 0–20, 20–40 and 40–60 min. Furthermore, we sampled cells that were stored for 120 and 180 min on ice.
