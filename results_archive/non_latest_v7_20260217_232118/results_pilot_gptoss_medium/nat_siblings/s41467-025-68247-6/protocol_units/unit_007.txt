For DSS treatment, DSS (MP Biomedicals) was dissolved in organoid media (without EGF or Nicotinamide), and added to organoid wells overnight for 16 h, after which organoids were washed twice with Advanced DMEM/F12 and then replaced with organoid media. The low and high doses considered were 0.1% DSS and 0.5% (wt/vol) DSS in organoid media.
