Bulk ATAC-seq library preparation and sequencing Bulk ATAC-seq libraries were generated as described57. In brief, 50,000 nuclei were permeablized and tagmented. Tagmented chromatin libraries were generated and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq with a target sequencing depth of 50 million reads per library.
