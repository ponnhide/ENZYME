Nucleus isolation from frozen primary tissue Tissue sections were snap frozen and stored at −80 °C. Nuclei were isolated from frozen tissues as described57. In brief, frozen tissue samples were thawed in 2 ml chilled homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.8, 5 mM CaCl₂, 3 mM magnesium acetate, 320 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40, 167 μM β‑mercaptoethanol, 16.7 μM PMSF) and lysed in a pre‑chilled dounce.
