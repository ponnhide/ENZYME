Nucleus isolation from cerebral organoids Cerebral organoids were dissociated in papain containing DNase I (DNase) for 30 min at 37 °C and samples were triturated to form a single‑cell suspension. Cells (10⁶) were pelleted and lysed for 3 min in 100 μl chilled lysis buffer (10 mM Tris‑HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl₂, 0.1% Tween‑20, 0.1% Igepal CA‑630, 0.01% digitonin, 1% BSA).
