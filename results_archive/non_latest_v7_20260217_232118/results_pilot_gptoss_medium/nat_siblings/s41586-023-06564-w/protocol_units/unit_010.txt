To generate hFA, hCO and hSO were generated separately and assembled by placing them in close proximity in 24-well low attachment plates (Corning, catalogue no. 3473), which were placed slightly tilted in the incubator. Medium was changed 3 days later. Assembloids were then cultured in the 24-well low attachment plates until day 45.
