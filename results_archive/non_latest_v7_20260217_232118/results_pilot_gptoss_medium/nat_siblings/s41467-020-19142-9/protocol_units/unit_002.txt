Organoid generation and cultures. Colonic epithelial organoid lines were derived as previously described56,57. Brieﬂy, crypts of the healthy portion of the colonic epithelium (at least 10 cm away from the tumor side) were isolated by digestion of the intestinal mucosa in chelation solution (5.6 mM Na2HPO4, 8.0 mM KH2PO4, 96.2 mM NaCl, 1.6 mM KCl, 43.4 mM Sucrose, and 54.9 mM D-Sorbitol, Sigma) supplemented with dithiotreitol (0.5 mM, Sigma) and EDTA (2 mM, in-house) for 30 min at 4 °C.
