Ligand intensities from each tumor organoid clone were compared by retention time alignment and label-free quantiﬁcation in a pair-wise manner. Between 15–25% of all ligands varied in intensity by more than 2-fold in each pairwise comparison (black). Quantitative variations by >2-fold were extremely few at <1%, between two independent preparations of JY cell line peptide ligands analyzed months apart with the same LC‑MS settings, validating these quantitative ligand variations were not of technical nature.
