To verify the lineage potential of mesothelial epicardial cells in our system, we generated epicardioids from the FLP/FRT-based hiPSC reporter line and transduced them with a lentiviral vector encoding FLP (FLPERT2) under the control of the CDH1 promoter at day 15 (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9a).
