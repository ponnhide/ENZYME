1. Warm a 6-well plate with MG-coated wells by placing it in a 37 °C, 5% CO₂ incubator for ~30 min or keeping it at room temperature for 1 h in a biosafety cabinet.
2. Aliquot 6 mL of E8 medium and 3 mL of stem cell medium per a frozen vial of PS cells into separate 15 mL Falcon tubes. Warm medium aliquots to 37 °C and add 3 µL of Y‑27632 (1:1,000) to stem cell medium.
3. Take a frozen aliquot of cells from liquid nitrogen and thaw the aliquot by dipping it in a 37 °C water bath while monitoring the process every few seconds.
4. As the vial of cells starts thawing take the aliquot to the biosafety cabinet after thoroughly spraying it with 70% ethanol and wiping it with a napkin.
5. Using a 5 mL serological pipet, draw 6 mL of E8 medium into the pipet. Then, collect the medium containing the thawed cells in the same pipet. Very slowly transfer the pipet content (6 mL of E8 medium and ~1 mL of medium containing thawed cells) into a 15 mL conical tube.
6. Spin cells down at 1,000 rpm (300 g) for 4 min at room temperature.
