24. Change medium daily. During medium changes, tilt the plate ~30° and aspirate ~90% of the old medium with floating cells. Then, add 4 mL of fresh neural induction medium. Repeat this daily for 7–10 d. Stop neural induction and transition to the next step when the typical signs of successful neural induction are observed, including tissue thickening, curling and detachment (Fig. 2c).
