48. Cut an ~40 mm square of Parafilm and disinfect it by spraying with 70% ethanol. Place the Parafilm over the plastic portion of an empty P200 pipette tip holder (the section with holes). Using the rubber end of a 3 mL syringe plunger, apply pressure to the Parafilm directly above a hole to form a dimple to be filled with MG. Repeat this step to make the necessary number of dimples.
49. Carefully detach the Parafilm square from the pipette tip holder by peeling it away from the surface while maintaining the dimple shape.
53. Retrieve P200 pipette tips from the −20 °C freezer and use the cold tips to draw up 30 µL thawed MG. Then, carefully add MG on top of the organoid in the Parafilm dimple. Use the same tip to reposition the organoid into the center of the MG droplet and remove bubbles if accidentally introduced.
54. Place the lid with organoids on the plate containing the organoid propagation medium, so that the Parafilm is now upside down without the MG droplets touching the medium. Transfer the dish to a 37 °C incubator and incubate for 30 min. During this time, the MG will gelate.
55. Retrieve the dish from the incubator and bring it into the biosafety cabinet. Detach the Parafilm from the lid and use an ethanol‑disinfected gloved finger to pop out the dimples. Hold the Parafilm square vertically over the plate and use a P1000 pipette with 1 mL medium from the dish to spray quickly at each MG droplet, causing the droplet to slide into the media in the plate.
