27. Aspirate neural induction medium and add 1 mL dispase per well. Incubate the plate at 37 °C. Begin monitoring cell detachment under a microscope after 5 min of incubation. Some lines may already be detached after 5 min. However, it takes 15–20 min for the cell sheet to detach for most PS cell lines. Once the sheet of cells is detached, carefully transfer it into a 15 mL conical tube using a 5 mL serological pipet.
28. Let the cell clump settle to the bottom of the tube by gravity. This will take 1–2 min. Then, carefully remove the supernatant using a 1 mL pipet to avoid disturbing the clump at the bottom.
29. Wash it three times using 3 mL N2/B27 medium. During each washing step, dislodge the clump from the bottom of the tube with medium while carefully avoiding breaking it into pieces. Let it settle to the bottom of the tube after each wash.
30. After the last wash, add 4 mL amplification medium and gently triturate (~5 times) the clump of cells using a 5 mL pipette to break it into small clumps of cells that are ~750 µm by 750 µm in size. Check the size under the microscope.
