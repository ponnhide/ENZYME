(i) Transfer 1‑month‑old organoids (before MG embedding) to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube using a P200 pipette tip cut to avoid damaging the organoids. Let organoids settle to the bottom, aspirate the medium and rinse once with sterile PBS.
(ii) Transfer the organoids to a 6 cm dish and chop them into small pieces using a scalpel. Collect pieces into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 rpm (300 g) at room temperature.
(iii) Discard the supernatant, add 500 µL of prewarmed papain with 5% DNase I and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min, gently tapping the tube every 10 min.
(iv) Discard the papain solution, add 500 µL of trypsin inhibitor, and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.
(v) Dissociate organoids into single cells by repeated pipetting with a P1000 pipette.
(vi) Centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 rpm.
