Introduction

There are multiple human-specific aspects of telencephalic brain development that
are difficult or impossible to recapitulate in animal models, including protracted
neurodevelopment, extensive diversity and complexity of human brain cells, expression
of human-specific genes and gene networks, and distinct functional properties of human
neurons and neural networks1–7. Moreover, genetic abnormalities detected in patients with
neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders may alter the human-specific aspects of
neurodevelopment; therefore, human-based models are needed to study human brain
development under normal and pathological conditions8,9.
 Primary human fetal brain tissue obtained from terminated pregnancies has been
effectively used to study early stages of fetal human telencephalic brain development10–13.
These studies identified human-specific brain cells and characterized the cell type-specific
genes and gene networks associated with the specification and development of these cells.
In parallel, postmortem brain tissue from patients is utilized to identify cells and molecular
pathways that are disrupted in the adult human cortex in association with various brain
disorders14–16. However, important limitations of these approaches include that fetal brain tissue
is rarely available from patients with specific genetic abnormalities, and neither the fetal nor
adult tissues are amenable to genetic manipulations in long-term mechanistic experiments.
 To overcome these limitations, new methods and protocols have been developed to
differentiate and reprogram human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem (PS) cells into
different types of telencephalic neural cell, including neural progenitors, excitatory and
inhibitory neurons, and glial cells, in vitro17–23. The use of these approaches in research has
allowed the discovery as well as genetic manipulation of the properties of patient-specific
neural cells and the identification of disease-related phenotypes and mechanisms. However,
despite many advantages of two-dimensional cultures in mechanistic experiments, they are
not well-suited for neurodevelopment as they lack other telencephalic cell types and specific
organization present during brain development.
 Self-organized telencephalic brain tissues, collectively termed telencephalic brain
organoids here, recapitulate many important aspects of fetal human telencephalic
development, including cell-type specification, development and organization, and have
already been used for disease modeling24–29, leading to new insights into the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of human brain development in health and disease (reviewed in
refs. 8,9,30–36). Although the overall enthusiasm for studying human brain development
using brain organoids is on the rise, the approach has several notable limitations—including
the variability of cellular composition and organization37, impaired specification of humanspecific neural progenitors and late-born superficial layer cortical neurons38, as well as
disrupted cortical lamination39 and impaired functional maturation of neurons and neural
networks37,40–42—which limit the use of organoids in research.
 In contrast to many of these previous methods, which include multiple neural rosettes (NRs)
per organoid, we recently developed a method for generating telencephalic brain organoids
from human stem cell-derived single neural rosettes (SNRs)43. NRs are spontaneously organized
three-dimensional multicellular structures that resemble a cross-section of the neural tube and
emerge in vitro upon the successful differentiation of PS cells into neuroectodermal lineage
cells44–46. We demonstrated that starting organoid formation from SNRs leads to predictably
organized telencephalic organoids with reproducible cellular composition and functional
neural networks. Unlike other brain organoid models, SNR-derived organoids contain both
pallial and subpallial lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE)-like neural progenitors, cortical and
striatal neurons, as well as periendothelial and ependymal cells. Here, we outline the rationale
behind generating organoids from isolated SNRs and discuss the advantages, limitations
and potential applications of this method. We also detail the experimental procedures for
generating SNR-derived organoids from control and CRISPR–Cas9-edited stem cell lines
and their use for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), immunohistochemistry and slice
patch-clamp electrophysiology.

Protocol


Development of the protocol
Rationale for generating organoids from SNRs
During the early stages of human embryonic development (18–19 d post-conception),
gastrulation results in the formation of three germ cell layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and
endoderm47. As development progresses, ectodermal cells undergo extensive proliferation and
form the neural plate (20–21 d post-conception), which is followed by the formation of neural
folds (22–23 d post-conception) and then a singular neural tube (25–26 d post-conception) that
extends throughout the entire embryo. The wall of the neural tube comprises polarized and
pseudostratified neuroepithelial cells that are the earliest neural progenitors in the developing
human embryo. Proper neural tube formation is vital for normal embryonic development,
as neural tube formation abnormalities are known to lead to different birth defects, such
as anencephaly, spina bifida and encephalocele. Remarkably, neural tube-like structures,
termed ‘neural rosettes’, can be spontaneously generated from PS cells in vitro during neural
differentiation44–46. We hypothesized that isolated SNRs could be used as a starting material for
generating predictably organized brain organoids with a singular neural tube-like structure
to mimic the natural development of neural tissue from the singular neural tube. Importantly,
multiple rosette-like structures in neural tissue have been observed in association with brain
tumors48, which may affect neuronal differentiation, migration and maturation49. In the
following sections, we provide the rationale for using specific procedures and reagents during
the generation of SNRs and SNR-derived organoids from human PS cells (Fig. 1).

Neural induction
Efficient neural induction of PS cells in vitro can be achieved through the use of dual-SMAD
inhibition via co-application of a BMP–SMAD1/5/8 inhibitor, such as Noggin, LDN193189 or
dorsomorphin, and an inhibitor of the TGF-β–activin–NODAL–SMAD2/3 signaling pathway,
such as SB-431542 (ref. 18). The dual-SMAD inhibitors induce the neuralization of ectodermal
tissue while destabilizing the pluripotency gene expression networks and suppressing the
induction of mesodermal fates in PS cells. Thus, we use the dual-SMAD inhibitors dorsomorphin
(4 μM) and SB-431542 (10 μM) in neurobasal media with the vitamin A-containing B27
supplement for neural induction (Figs. 1 and 2a–c). Notably, no other organoid generation
protocols use vitamin A-containing B27, as vitamin A is a precursor of retinoic acid, which is
known to induce neural tissue caudalization50. However, we detected no or few cells expressing
caudal markers, such as EN1, FOXA2, GBX2, PAX2, and HOXA2 and HOXA1, in SNR-derived
organoids grown in media with vitamin A-containing B27 (ref. 43), suggesting that a higher
concentration of retinoic acid is probably necessary to induce the caudalization of neural
tissue. Our rationale for using vitamin A-containing B27 was to promote intermediate neural
progenitor specification and corticogenesis51,52.
 Another important distinction of our neural induction protocol is that we use no
Wnt inhibitors. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for supporting neural progenitor
proliferation53,54 and dorsal telencephalic patterning55,56, while Wnt inhibitors are known to
promote the ventralization of telencephalic tissue57,58. We decided to rely on endogenous
morphogens, such as BMP7 and Wnt antagonists SFRP1 and FRZB, which have been detected
in SNR-derived organoids43, to induce the default neurodevelopmental program for the
specification of telencephalic cell fates17,57. Finally, to stimulate the proliferation of newly
differentiated neuroectodermal cells and facilitate their adoption of radial glial identity,
we treat the cultures of neuroepithelial cells with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2, 10 ng/mL)
and epidermal growth factor (EGF, 10 ng/mL)59,60. In our preliminary experiments, we noticed
that cultures without FGF2 exhibit impaired NR formation, limited organoid growth and
increased cell death. The emergence of neural rosettes is typically observed at 6–8 d post
EGF/FGF2-treatment initiation (Fig. 2d).

NRs
Each NR is a self-organized, three-dimensional, multicellular structure consisting of
neuroepithelial and radial glial cells that are radially distributed around a central lumen
(Fig. 2e). NR cells undergo interkinetic nuclear migration between the basal (outer) and apical

plastic and their differentiation can be directed toward different regional cell fates using a
specific set of morphogens46,50. Most PS cell-derived NRs emerge in clusters of multiple rosettes
(Fig. 2d). Therefore, we manually isolate SNRs that are ~200–300 μm in diameter for organoid
generation (Fig. 2f). Cells in SNRs are characterized by the expression of the proliferation
markers pH3 and KI67, neural progenitor markers SOX2 and NESTIN, and telencephalic markers
PAX6 and FOXG143, suggesting telencephalic identity. We noted that smaller SNRs (<150 μm in
diameter) often fail to transform into organoids and grow in suspension culture.

SNR-derived organoids
We transfer isolated SNRs to a low-adhesion 96-well plate (one SNR per well) and maintain
them on an orbital shaker in the N2/B27(with vitamin A) media with FGF2 and EGF for 2 weeks
(Figs. 1 and 3). We empirically determined that one SNR per well is required to prevent their
fusion and that FGF2 is essential for supporting organoid growth. During this time, the majority
of SNRs grow in size, reaching 400–700 μm in diameter by the end of 2 weeks, and transform
into organoids with a singular lumen (Fig. 3). We observed no correlation between the size of
each organoid and the number of lumens (Figs. 3 and 4). However, we noticed that SNR-derived

organoids failed to grow beyond 1–1.5 mm in diameter while cultured in 96-well plates even
after an extended propagation in FGF2- and EGF-containing medium. To promote further tissue
growth, we adopted the approach developed by Lancaster and Knoblich27 and embedded
SNR-derived organoids into Matrigel (MG) droplets (Fig. 5a). Following MG embedding, we
observed notable transformations, including substantial tissue growth, migration of cells into
MG and extensive radiation of fibers (Fig. 5b,c). Organoids continued expanding in MG during
the next 4 months of culture, reaching the size of 3–5 mm in diameter by ~5 months postinduction (~4 months post-embedding) (Fig. 5d–g). Between 3 and 4 months post-embedding,
we treated organoids with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT3)
and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (Fig. 1) to promote neuronal survival, maturation
and synapse development62,63. Our reasoning for applying these factors later in differentiation,
as opposed to early in the process28,37,64,65, was that at later stages the trophic factors are more
suitable for promoting synaptic development. Furthermore, we applied these factors later to
minimize the risk of premature or ectopic neuronal differentiation.

 Comparison with other methods for generating telencephalic organoids
 Although multiple protocols have been developed for generating telencephalic brain organoids
 from human PS cells24,26,28,41,66–68, our protocol differs in several important ways. First, while
 most protocols start with dissociated pluripotent or neural stem cell aggregates that result
 in the formation of organoids with multiple rosettes, we start with carefully isolated SNRs.
 Isolated SNRs retain self-organization in suspension culture, giving rise to organoids with

predictable organization and reproducible cellular composition, as confirmed by comparisons
of scRNA-seq datasets from several studies43. This mimics the natural development of neural
tissue from the neural tube. Second, in contrast to other protocols, our approach involves
the use of (1) vitamin A-containing B27 supplement, (2) no Wnt inhibitors, (3) prolonged
early treatment with FGF2 and EGF and (4) late, transient exposure to trophic factors (Fig. 1).
Our reasoning for introducing these specific modifications is described in the preceding section.
 Recently, several methods have been developed for more efficient SNR generation from
stem cells (without mechanical dissection from NR clusters)65,69,70. In line with our findings, these
studies reported reproducible cell composition and predictable cell organization in SNRs and
early SNR-derived organoids. In contrast to our study, these studies did not apply FGF2 and EGF
treatment and MG embedding to promote the proliferation of neural progenitors in SNRs and
SNR-derived organoids and obtained relatively small-size organoids (<1.2 mm in diameter by
5 months) with inconsistent organization and impeded functional maturation of neurons and
neural networks65.

Potential applications and adaptations
Our approach for generating organoids can be useful for modeling both normal human
telencephalic development and neurodevelopmental disorders43,71. We demonstrated that the
composition of cells in 1-month-old SNR-derived organoids is highly reproducible, consisting of
telencephalic neural progenitors and both inhibitory and excitatory neurons. This allowed us to
study the specification of different types of neural progenitors and neurons in the developing
telencephalon. Using scRNA-seq-based computational lineage tracing72, we identified signaling
pathways that are associated with the specification of excitatory and inhibitory neural lineages
from a common pool of unspecified neural progenitors. A similar approach can be used to
elucidate the specification of other cell types in the developing human telencephalon under
normal and pathological conditions, including different subtypes of excitatory and inhibitory
neurons and outer radial glia cells that were also detected in 1-month-old SNR-derived
organoids43.
 In addition, we showed that 5-month-old organoids consist of a diversity of neural cells,
including excitatory and inhibitory neural progenitors, deep- and superficial layer cortical
excitatory neurons, LGE-derived inhibitory interneurons, primary striatal inhibitory neurons,
and astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and periendothelial and ependymal cells. Remarkably,
ependymal cells line the lumen in 5-month-old SNR-derived organoids, cortical excitatory
neurons exhibit lamination and primary striatal inhibitory neurons are largely distributed
underneath the cortical layers. These results suggest that 5-month-old SNR-derived organoids
can be used for studying cortical lamination and the specification of glial, periendothelial and
ependymal cells.
 Finally, we found that 5-month-old SNR-derived organoids consist of a relatively large
proportion of functionally mature neurons that generate action potentials, receive both
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, and demonstrate functional neural networks,
suggesting that these organoids can be useful for studying the establishment and function of
neural networks in the developing human brain under normal and pathological conditions8.
 We envision that the SNR-based approach can also be used for generating other brain
region-specific organoids, such as striatal, thalamic, cerebellar and midbrain organoids,
with a predictable organization that could further be used for assembling multi-brain regioncontaining organoids, as it has already been done for multi-rosette-containing organoids73–76.
Such organoids will be useful for studying inter-regional brain communication, including
migration and connectivity31,77. In addition, brain organoids with predictable organization and
reproducible cellular composition could be useful for building new biocomputers for artificial
intelligence-related applications78.

Limitations
The limitations of our approach include the use of manual procedures for SNR isolation and
the heterogeneity of isolated SNRs in terms of size, shape and quality, which could contribute
to organoid-to-organoid variability (Figs. 3 and 4). Manual SNR isolation requires time and skill

Protocol


to perform. Initially, it might be difficult to identify a SNR using a stereoscope and to perform a
clean SNR isolation. Thus, it is expected that some initially isolated SNR-containing tissue may
contain no SNRs, a small SNR or multiple rosettes (Fig. 4). Such isolations will probably fail to
grow or transform into multi-lumen-containing organoids.
 We observed that the size and shape of SNRs varies substantially even within a
single well. We most often isolate SNRs that are at least 200 μm in diameter with a
clearly distinguishable single lumen without taking the shapes of the lumen and rosette
into consideration. Thus, isolated SNRs are of slightly different sizes (mean ± s.e.m. of
297 ± 3 μm; 95% confidence interval: 290.6–303.3) and shapes. These factors could potentially
influence the identities and distribution of cells in SNR-derived organoids. Recently, new
methods have been developed for generating uniform SNRs with a defined size and shape
using spatially confined micropatterned substrates69,70. We foresee that these innovations
can be adapted to enhance the efficiency of generating uniform SNR-derived organoids
and to explore the effects of SNR size and shape on the properties and organization of cells
in organoids.
 Another potential limitation is non-uniform lamination of organoid tissue. Although
we found regions in organoid sections with predictably organized neural cells, the
organization was not uniform throughout the organoid. Instead, we observed regions
with unclear or no organization43. Those areas, however, were readily identifiable by visual
inspection of a slice or section and were excluded from investigations involving imaging
and electrophysiology experiments. The impact of disorganized areas on overall organoid
development remains unclear.
 Other limitations are common to most organoid generation protocols34, including the
absence of vasculature to allow oxygen and nutrient delivery inside of the organoids, the lack of
microglia to regulate the number of cells and synapses in organoids and the absence of neuronal
inputs from the sensory organs and other brain regions to recapitulate information flow in
complex brain networks. Recently, xenotransplantation of human organoids into the rodent
brain has been used to overcome some of these limitations79–82.

Experimental design
The organoid generation protocol consists of five stages (Fig. 1): (1) PS cell maintenance and
propagation, (2) neural induction, (3) NR formation and isolation, (4) organoid formation
from isolated SNRs and (5) organoid maturation. The rationale for each stage is discussed
in the preceding section. Here, we provide an overview of these five stages and additional
considerations regarding the protocol and experimental procedures that we perform with
SNR-derived organoids, including the generation of CRISPR–Cas9-engineered human stem
cells with large genetic deletions (Box 1 and Fig. 6), scRNA-seq (Fig. 7), immunohistochemistry
(Fig. 8) and slice patch-clamp electrophysiology (Fig. 9).

Stage 1: PS cell maintenance and propagation (Steps 1–21)
This section details the steps for thawing and passaging PS cells. It is essential to use validated
and characterized human stem cell lines. Insufficiently characterized lines may lead to
irreproducible results. We recommend following the standards for use of human stem cells
in research recently released by the International Society for Stem Cell Research83. Wellcharacterized human stem cell lines produced from healthy control individuals and patients
with various genetic abnormalities are now available from multiple sources, including WiCell,
Allen Institute for Cell Sciences, National Institute of Mental Health, Simons Foundation Autism
Research Initiative and California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. For disease modeling
studies, we recommend always including isogenic engineered lines as controls. The most
controlled approach is to use conditional CRE- or FLP-mediated induction/rescue of genetic
abnormality during differentiation84. This approach has successfully been used for studying
autism spectrum disorder-, schizophrenia- and Alzheimer’s disease-associated genetic
abnormalities85–87; however, it has not been used for studying large genetic abnormalities. In our
previous study43, we used a pair of guide RNAs to excise a complete copy of SHANK3 (~69.5 kB) in
human PS cells (Box 1).

Stage 2: neural induction (Steps 22–24)
We start neural induction with PS cells that achieved 80–90% confluency (Fig. 2a). Then, cells
are replated at 1:1 ratio onto MG-coated plates (Fig. 2b). To initiate the induction, we change the
stem cell medium to the induction medium on the next day after replating (Fig. 1). The duration
of neural induction is line dependent, spanning 5–10 d. The variability in the duration of neural
induction could be due to the variable expression levels of BMP and TGF-β receptors in different
human PS cell lines88. We stop neural induction and transition to the next step when we observe
tissue thickening due to cell layering, as well as tissue curling and detachments (Fig. 2c), which
are the hallmarks of successful acquisition of neuroectodermal fate. It is critical to assess daily
the progression of neural induction and remove floating dead cells during medium changes.
We normally do this by tilting the culture dish ~30° and aspirating 80–90% of old medium
containing any floating cells.

Stage 3: NR formation and isolation (Steps 25–43)
The successfully induced cultures are replated using Dispase, which allows the detachment
of neuroectodermal cell clusters. The clusters of neuroectodermal cells give rise to NRs.
Upon replating, we switch to the amplification medium with EGF (10 ng/mL) and FGF2
(10 ng/mL). Half the medium is exchanged every other day with fresh medium containing
2× EGF (20 ng/mL) and 2× FGF2 (20 ng/mL) to maintain the final concentration at 10 ng/mL.
We limit FGF2 exposure to 5 d (two medium changes) to avoid potential tissue caudalization50.
We continue including EGF until NRs become apparent. We use glass Pasteur pipettes bent

Bassoon specific antibodies to visualize synapses. Scale bars, 200 μm (a and b) and 10 μm (a, zoom-in and b, far right
zoom-ins).


Stage 4: organoid formation from isolated SNRs (Steps 44–45)
Isolated SNRs are cultured in suspension on an orbital shaker at 45 rpm with the amplification
medium containing EGF (10 ng/mL) and FGF2 (10 ng/mL). We use a multichannel pipettor
for half medium changes every other day. The fresh medium contains 2× EGF (20 ng/mL) and
2× FGF2 (20 ng/mL) to maintain the final concentrations of these growth factors at 10 ng/mL.
At this stage, it is important to confirm tissue growth. In our preliminary experiments,
we discovered that organoids failed to grow in the amplification medium without FGF2.
We take images of SNR-derived organoids at 1, 7 and 14 d post-isolation (Fig. 3). One-month-old
SNR-derived organoids that exhibit consistent growth and a distinct singular lumen can be MG
embedding in Stage 5 (Fig. 5). They can also be used for scRNA-seq and immunohistochemistry
(see the ‘Downstream assays’ section below).

Stage 5: organoid maturation (Steps 46–60)
SNR-derived organoids with a clearly visible singular lumen are embedded in MG on days
14–15 post-isolation (~1 month post-induction) (Fig. 1). During embedding, the individual
organoids are placed into Parafilm dimples (one organoid per dimple), which are then filled with
MG (25 μL per dimple) and transferred to a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for MG gelation (Fig. 5a).
The gelated MG droplets containing organoids are then transferred into 10 cm Petri dishes
(5–7 organoids per dish) for long-term culture on an orbital shaker in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.
During the next 4 months, organoids substantially increase in size and exhibit notable cell
migration and process extension into the MG (Fig. 5). Between 3 and 4 months post-MG
embedding (4 and 5 months post-induction), the organoids are treated with BDNF (10 ng/mL),
NT3 (10 ng/mL) and GDNF (10 ng/mL) to promote neuronal and network maturation (Fig. 1).
We usually use 5-month-old organoids for ssRNA-seq, immunohistochemistry and slice
patch-clamp electrophysiology (see the ‘Downstream assays’ section).

Downstream assays (Step 61)
To characterize the composition of cells in generated organoids, we dissociated organoids
into single cells and use them for scRNA-seq (Fig. 7). We optimized organoid dissociation
protocols for 1- and 5-month-old organoids to obtain high proportions of live single cells for
library preparation and sequencing. The dissociation procedures are slightly different for
1-month-old (Step 61A) and 5-month-old (Step 61B) organoids, as they have different sizes and
cell compositions. For organoids of intermediate age, we recommend testing both protocols
and selecting the one that yields a higher percentage of viable cells.
 To characterize the organization of cells in organoids, we used cryosectioning and
immunohistochemistry (Step 61C; Fig. 8) with specific antibodies (Table 1). We optimized a
standard immunohistochemistry protocol for examining frozen organoid sections, enabling
us to identify different cell types and their distributions in organoid sections.
 Finally, for functional characterization of neurons in 5-month-old SNR-derived organoids,
we performed slice patch-clamp electrophysiology (Step 61D; Fig. 9). We briefly describe our
protocol for preparing organoid slices and recording from human neurons in the slices. Our
protocol represents a modification of several protocols that are commonly used for brain slice
patch-clamp electrophysiology89–91.

Expertise needed to implement the protocol
We recommend a collaborative approach involving two individuals—a postdoc or graduate
student and a technician—for protocol implementation. Ideally, one person should have
experience working with cultured cells and be well-versed in aseptic techniques. Another
person should be available to help with the progress documentation and medium changes.

Reagent setup
MG aliquots
Thaw a 5 mL MG bottle by placing it overnight at 4 °C. Use cold pipette tips and 1.5 mL
Eppendorf tubes for aliquoting MG. Before aliquoting, cool them down by placing a
box of 1 mL tips and a rack with 20 Eppendorf tubes at −20 °C for an hour. Aliquot
~250 μL of MG per tube (the exact volume is determined based on the lot number). Store
MG aliquots at −20 °C for up to 2 years from the date of manufacture, which is lot specific.
Avoid freeze–thaw cycles.

MG-coated plates
Thaw an aliquot of MG on ice (takes ~30 min). Aliquot 25 mL of refrigerated DMEM/F12 medium
into a 50 mL conical tube (ensure it stays cool). Add the thawed MG to the medium and
thoroughly mix using a 10 mL pipette. For 6-well plates, add 1 mL of the diluted MG per well.
For immediate use, let the coated plates sit at room temperature (20–22 °C) for ~30 min. For
later use, wrap the plates with parafilm and store them in the fridge. Warm them up for 30 min in
a CO2 incubator at 37 °C or for an hour at room temperature right before use. MG can be reused
twice. Coat new wells with the collected MG instead of discarding it. We store MG-coated plates
at 4 °C for up to 1 month.

Procedure

Stage 1: PS cell maintenance and propagation
Thawing PS cells
● TIMING 2 h
1. Warm a 6-well plate with MG-coated wells by placing it in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for
 ~30 min or keeping it at room temperature for 1 h in a biosafety cabinet.
2. Aliquot 6 mL of E8 medium and 3 mL of stem cell medium per a frozen vial of PS cells into
 separate 15 mL Falcon tubes. Warm medium aliquots to 37 °C and add 3 μL of Y-27632
 (1:1,000) to stem cell medium.
3. Take a frozen aliquot of cells from liquid nitrogen and thaw the aliquot by dipping it in a
 37 °C water bath while monitoring the process every few seconds.
 ▲ CAUTION Safety goggles must be worn when thawing frozen cells, as the vial with cells
 may contain some liquid nitrogen and burst upon immersion in the water bath.
4. As the vial of cells starts thawing take the aliquot to the biosafety cabinet after thoroughly
 spraying it with 70% ethanol and wiping it with a napkin.
5. Using a 5 mL serological pipet, draw 6 mL of E8 medium into the pipet. Then, collect
 the medium containing the thawed cells in the same pipet. Very slowly transfer the pipet
 content (6 mL of E8 medium and ~1 mL of medium containing thawed cells) into a 15 mL
 conical tube.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP It is important to avoid abrupt mixing of cells in freezing medium with
 E8 medium to prevent cell death due to abrupt osmolarity change.
6. Spin cells down at 1,000 rpm (300g) for 4 min at room temperature
7. Bring the conical tube with cells into the biosafety cabinet and carefully aspirate the
 supernatant, with care to avoid disrupting the cell pellet.
8. Add 3 mL of stem cell medium with Y-27632 and gently resuspend the pellet using the 5 mL
 serological pipet to pipet the solution up and down ~5 times.
9. Aspirate (or collect) MG from the coated wells and add 3 mL of the cell suspension per well.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP There is no MG washing step.
10. Place the plate in the incubator. Then, move it back-to-forth and left-to-right a few times to
 evenly spread the cells over the entire surface. Do not move the plate after this.

Nature Protocols | Volume 21 | February 2026 | 718–748 737

Protocol


Propagating and passaging PS cells for neural induction
● TIMING 1–2 weeks
11. The next day after thawing the PS cells, change the medium to 3 mL of stem cell medium
 without Y-27632. During the medium change, tilt the plate ~30° to allow for aspiration of
 ~90% of the old medium, trying to remove floating cells.
12. Change medium daily by removing ~90% of the old medium and adding 3 mL of fresh stem
 cell medium without Y-27632. Passage PS cells when they reach 50–70% confluency (Fig. 2a).
13. To passage one well, warm 1 mL dispase, 6 mL Essential 8 medium and 9 mL stem cell medium.
 Prepare MG-coated plates. Add 4.5 μL of Y-27632 (1:2,000) to warmed stem cell medium.
14. Aspirate 100% of the old stem cell medium and add 1 mL dispase.
15. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 5–8 min, monitoring the progress of dissociation. When the
 edges of PS cell colonies become partially detached, aspirate dispase and wash cells with
 Essential 8 medium three times (2 mL per wash).
16. After the last wash, add 3 mL of stem cell medium and scrape cells off the plate gently using a
 cell scraper.
17. Gently triturate detached colonies using a 1 mL pipette tip 5 times (or a 5 mL serological
 pipet 10–15 times) to break them into smaller pieces.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Check under the microscope that the resultant colonies are small and
 uniformly sized.
18. We usually split PS cells 1:3. For this, transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube
 and adjust the total volume of stem cell medium with Y-27632 to 9 mL.
19. Add 3 mL of cell suspension to each MG-coated well.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP To equally distribute cell between the wells, make sure cell clumps are not
 settled at the bottom of the tube before drawing medium into the pipette.
20. Place the plate with dissociated cells in the incubator and move it back-to-forth and
 left-to-right a few times to evenly spread the cells over the entire surface.
21. Change the medium daily by removing ~90% of the old media and adding 3 mL of fresh stem
 cell medium without Y-27632 until cells reach ~90% confluency.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Avoid overgrowing cells beyond 90% confluency.

Stage 2: neural induction
● TIMING 5–10 d
22. One day before the initiation of neural induction, replate PS cells at a 1:1 ratio into new
 MG-coated wells following the procedures described in the preceding section (Steps 13–20).
23. On the next day (day 0) (Fig. 2b), cell should be 90% confluent again. Initiate neural induction
 by aspirating half of the stem cell medium and adding 2 mL of neural induction medium.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
24. Change medium daily. During medium changes, tilt the plate ~30° and aspirate ~90% of the
 old medium with floating cells. Then, add 4 mL of fresh neural induction medium. Repeat
 this daily for 7–10 d. Stop neural induction and transition to the next step when the typical
 signs of successful neural induction are observed, including tissue thickening, curling and
 detachment (Fig. 2c).
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Many dead cells are expected the first couple of days after the initiation
 of neural induction. These cells should be removed during medium changes. The presence
 of many dead cells affects the efficiency of neural induction. Fresh medium should be added
 gently along the dish wall to avoid cell detachment. Some PS cell lines may begin to detach
 already at 5 d post-induction. If too many cells become detached, proceed to the next step.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING

Stage 3: neural rosette formation and isolation
Neural rosette formation: 6–11 d
25. For each well to be passaged, warm up three 35 mm dishes containing MG by placing them
 in the biosafety cabinet for ~30 min.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP We prefer to work with 35 mm dishes instead of 6-well plates as they are
 easier to position and rotate under the stereoscope for SNR isolation.

Nature Protocols | Volume 21 | February 2026 | 718–748 738

Protocol


26. For passaging one well, aliquot and warm 10 mL N2/B27 medium (for washing), 1 mL dispase
 (for dissociation) and 12 mL of amplification medium without EGF and FGF2 for replating.
 Add 10 ng/mL FGF2 (1:10,000) and 10 ng/mL EGF (1:10,000) to warm amplification medium
 just before use.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Growth factors such as FGF2 and EGF are extremely sensitive to temperature
 fluctuations. Keep the stock solutions refrigerated at all times.
27. Aspirate neural induction medium and add 1 mL dispase per well. Incubate the plate at 37 °C.
 Begin monitoring cell detachment under a microscope after 5 min of incubation. Some lines
 may already be detached after 5 min of incubation. However, it takes 15–20 min for the cell
 sheet to detach for most PS cell lines. Once the sheet of cells is detached, carefully transfer it
 into a 15 mL conical tube using a 5 mL serological pipet.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Incubation of cells with dispase should be no longer than 20 min.
28. Let the cell clump settle to the bottom of the tube by gravity. This will take 1–2 min.
 Then, carefully remove the supernatant using a 1 mL pipet to avoid disturbing the clump
 at the bottom.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Do not use an aspirator to remove the supernatant as the clump of cells
 may be aspirated accidentally.
29. Wash it three times using 3 mL N2/B27 medium. During each washing step, dislodge the
 clump from the bottom of the tube with medium while carefully avoiding breaking it into
 pieces. Let it settle to the bottom of the tube after each wash.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP It is important to thoroughly wash out the enzyme solution. Residual
 enzyme may cause excessive cell death. If many floating cells are detected the next day,
 increase the volume of medium used for washing and the number of washing steps.
30. After the last wash, add 4 mL amplification medium and gently triturate (~5 times) the
 clump of cells using a 5 mL pipette to break it into small clumps of cells that are ~750 μm
 by 750 μm in size. Check the size under the microscope.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP The clump size is important. We observed delayed emergence of NRs
 from smaller clumps of cells (<~300 μm by 300 μm). However, if the clump is too large
 (>~2,500 μm by 2,500 μm), it may not attach.
31. Replate the resultant clumps of cell at low density to promote NR formation. We usually
 replate one well into three or four 35 mm dishes. To replate into three dishes, transfer all cell
 clumps into a 15 mL conical tube and adjust the total volume with amplification medium to
 12 mL. If replating four dishes, scale the total volume to 16 mL. Then, split the total volume
 between three MG-coated dishes.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP To achieve equal distribution of cell clusters between the wells, pipette
 them up and down twice before drawing medium into the pipette for plating.
32. Place the dishes with cell clusters in an incubator and move them back-and-forth and
 side-to-side to evenly distribute clusters over the entire surface.
33. Change the medium every other day (two medium changes total, on days 2 and
 4 post-replating) by aspirating ~50% of the old medium and adding 2 mL of fresh
 amplification medium with 2× concentrations of FGF2 and EGF to achieve final FGF2
 and EGF concentrations of ~10 ng/mL. The clusters of NRs should begin emerging after
 two medium changes or 5–6 d post-replating (Fig. 2d).
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Change the medium by tilting the dish ~30° and aspirating as many dead
 floating cells as possible.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
34. On day 6 post-replating, prepare a glass hook (see ‘Equipment setup’) by spraying it with
 70% ethanol to sterilize before using it for SNR isolation.
35. Using a stereoscope positioned in a dissection biosafety cabinet, identify NR clusters
 (Fig. 2d) and SNRs (Fig. 2e) for manual isolation.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
36. Use the glass hook to isolate SNRs.
 • For clusters containing multiple NRs, cut them into ~200 × 200 µm pieces before
 proceeding to Step 37 to replate onto an MG-coated 35 mm dish
 • If working with isolated SNRs, proceed to Step 39

Nature Protocols | Volume 21 | February 2026 | 718–748 739

Protocol


37. Collect the isolated pieces with NRs from multiple clusters using a 1 mL pipette and
 transfer them onto a new MG-coated plate that contains 4 mL amplification medium
 with 10 ng/mL EGF only (without FGF2). The density of clusters should be sparse to allow
 SNR isolation.
38. Change the medium every other day by aspirating ~50% of the old medium and adding
 2 mL of fresh amplification medium with a 2× concentration of EGF to achieve a final EGF
 concentration of 10 ng/mL. It can take 2–3 d (up to 5 d) after replating for large (250–300 μm
 in diameter) SNRs to emerge.

SNR isolation
● TIMING 1–3 d
39. Prepare the amplification medium with EGF (10 ng/mL) and FGF2 (10 ng/mL) and fill each
 well of an ultralow attachment 96-well plate with 300 μL of medium before placement of the
 plate in the incubator.
40. Prepare a glass hook from a glass Pasteur pipette using a Bunsen burner (see ‘Equipment
 setup’). We do not usually reuse them.
41. Identify large SNRs (>200 μm in diameter) with a clearly visible single lumen for isolation
 under a stereoscope (Fig. 2e,f).
42. Carefully separate SNRs from the adjacent tissue using the glass hook and gently detach
 each one from the bottom of the dish (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Video 2).
43. Transfer isolated SNRs to 96-well plate (one SNR per well) using a P200 filtered pipette and
 return the plate to the incubator. We usually isolate 20–100 SNRs per day for 3 d. The plates
 with isolated SNRs are kept on an orbital shaker (45 rpm) in the incubator for 14–15 d.

Stage 4: SNR propagation in suspension culture
● TIMING 14 d
44. Change the medium every other day for 2 weeks by removing 50% of the old medium
 (150 μL) and adding 150 μL fresh amplification medium with 2× concentrations of FGF2 and
 EGF to achieve final FGF2 and EGF concentrations of 10 ng/mL.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Add fresh medium swiftly using a P200 filtered pipette to dislodge
 organoids from the bottom of the well. This prevents organoid attachment to the surface.
45. Take images of SNR-derived organoids at 1, 7 and 14 d post-isolation to document organoid
 development (Figs. 3 and 4). Only 1-month-old organoids that show a consistent increase
 in size and maintain a single lumen (Fig. 3) are imbedded in MG or used for dissociation
 (Step 61A) and scRNA-seq or immunohistochemistry (Step 61C).
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING

Stage 5: organoid maturation
Embedding SNR-derived organoids in MG droplets
● TIMING 2–4 h
46. Place a box of P200 pipette tips in a −20 °C freezer for at least 15 min to cool them before use
 for embedding.
47. Thaw MG aliquot(s) on ice 1–2 h before embedding; 30 μL of MG will be needed for
 embedding each organoid.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Keep MG on ice at all times to avoid MG gelation.
48. Cut an ~40 mm square of Parafilm and disinfect it by spraying with 70% ethanol. Place the
 Parafilm over of the plastic portion of an empty P200 pipette tip holder (the section with
 holes). Using the rubber end of a 3 mL syringe plunger, apply pressure to the parafilm
 directly above a hole to form a dimple to be filled with MG. Repeat this step to make the
 necessary number of dimples (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b).
 ▲ CAUTION Although 70% ethanol is a commonly used disinfectant, it may not fully
 decontaminate the Parafilm. Alternatively, the Parafilm pieces can be prepared in advance
 and decontaminated using gamma irradiation.
49. Carefully detach the Parafilm square from the pipette tip holder by peeling it away from the
 surface while maintaining the dimple shape.

Nature Protocols | Volume 21 | February 2026 | 718–748 740

Protocol


50. Place the dimpled Parafilm square on the inside of a sterile 10 cm Petri dish lid and press
 the Parafilm corners onto the surface using a fingernail so that it becomes stuck to the lid.
 This will tilt the corners without squashing the dimples (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
51. Fill another 10 cm Petri dish with 15 mL organoid propagation medium (without FGF2
 and EGF) and place it in the incubator. This dish will be used for MG droplet solidification
 in the incubator (Step 54).
52. Transfer individual organoids to individual Parafilm dimples using a P200 pipette tip
 (first cut the tip to enlarge the tip opening to fit the organoid) (Fig. 5a). Remove excess
 media from the dimples using a P200 pipette. Perform this step under the stereoscope
 to avoid aspiration of the organoids.
53. Retrieve P200 pipette tips from the −20 °C freezer and use the cold tips to draw up 30 μL
 thawed MG. Then, carefully add MG on top of the organoid in the Parafilm dimple. Use the
 same tip to reposition the organoid into the center of the MG droplet and remove bubbles
 if accidentally introduced.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Perform this step quickly to minimize the time the organoid is out of
 medium and prevent of MG gelation. We usually embed 6–10 organoids at a time.
54. Place the lid with organoids on the plate containing the organoid propagation medium,
 so that the Parafilm is now upside down without the MG droplets touching the medium
 (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Transfer the dish to a 37 °C incubator and incubate for 30 min.
 During this time, the MG will gelate. The MG becomes viscous at room temperature and
 will not fall off of the Parafilm.
55. Retrieve the dish from the incubator and bring it into the biosafety cabinet. Detach the
 Parafilm from the lid and use an ethanol-disinfected gloved finger to pop out the dimples.
 Hold the Parafilm square vertically over the plate and use a P1000 pipette with 1 mL medium
 from the dish to spray quickly at each MG droplet, causing the droplet to slide into the
 media in the plate. Repeat until all organoids are in the plate. If the MG droplets are floating,
 add some medium dropwise over them until they sink. We usually have 6–10 organoids per
 10 cm dish.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP It is important to observe MG-embedded organoids in the dish to
 avoid aspirating them into the pipette while taking medium from the dish to spray off the
 remaining organoids.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
56. Inspect the collected MG-embedded organoids under a microscope to ensure that the MG
 droplets are intact after being sprayed with media. Any organoids in damaged droplets will
 need to be re-embedded.
57. Place the dish with organoids into the incubator. Keep it stationary for ~48 h; afterward,
 transfer it to an orbital shaker (45 rpm) in the incubator.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Record the number of organoids in each plate. If organoids stick to each
 other, use a glass hook under a stereoscope to separate them.

Culturing SNR-derived organoids embedded in MG droplets
● TIMING 4 months
58. Change the medium every 4–5 d. Aspirate approximately half of the old medium and replace
 it with 10 mL of fresh organoid propagation medium (the total volume of medium is ~15 mL).
 Place dish(es) back on shaker in the incubator. It is expected that during the next 4 months
 organoids will exhibit notable cell migration and process extension into the MG (Fig. 5b,c).
 They will also substantially increase in size, reaching 3–5 mm in diameter by 5 months
 post-induction (Fig. 5d–g).
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Use a 10 mL pipette to carefully collect old medium. Do not use a vacuum
 aspirator.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
59. After 3 months in MG on the shaker, switch to the organoid maturation medium
 (with trophic factors). Continue changing the media every 4–5 d.
60. Switch back to the organoid propagation medium (without trophic factors) after 1 month
 (at 4 months in MG on the shaker).

 solution through a 40 μm cell strainer to obtain a single-cell suspension.
 (viii) Keep samples on ice.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
 (ix) Perform scRNA-seq. We use 10X Genomics Chromium Controller for single-cell
 capturing and library preparation following the 10X Genomics Chromium Single
 Cell 3′ reagent guidelines. We usually recover 10,000–20,000 cells/sample and
 sequence them with an average of 150,000 reads per cell using the Illumina HiSeq X
 or NovaSeq X reagent kit according to the reagent guidelines.

 Option B: dissociation procedures for 5-month-old organoids
 ● TIMING 2–3 h
 (i) Transfer an organoid to a 6 cm dish with ice-cold oxygenated cutting ACSF using a
 P1000 pipette tip cut to avoid damaging the organoid.
 (ii) Prepare the vibratome (Fig. 9a) by wiping the vibratome chamber with Kimwipes
 and coating the post with a thin layer of superglue.
 (iii) Mount the organoid on the glue-coated post using a plastic spatula. To prevent the
 organoid from sticking to the spatula, dip the spatula into PBS containing 0.5% BSA
 before use. Allow the organoid to attach firmly to the post.
 (iv) Fill the vibratome chamber with ice-cold, oxygenated cutting ACSF. Connect
 tubing to the vibratome chamber to bubble cutting ACSF with carbogen during
 slicing.
 (v) Cut 350-µm-thick slices using the vibratome set to 100 Hz frequency, 1.2 mm
 amplitude and a very slow forward movement velocity (Fig. 9b).
 (vi) Stop the vibratome after each slice. Under a magnifying glass, use a bent insulin
 needle to separate the slice from the remaining tissue, and transfer the slice into a
 maintenance beaker with bubbling ACSF using a wide Pasteur pipette.
 (vii) Collect slices/pieces into 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 rpm.

 (i) Fixation: transfer organoids to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube using a P200 pipette
 tip cut to avoid damaging the organoids.
 (ii) Let organoids settle to the bottom, aspirate the medium, and rinse once with sterile
 PBS. Carefully remove PBS without collecting organoids.
 (iii) Discard the supernatant, add 250 μL of 4% PFA and incubate overnight at 4 °C.
 ▲ CAUTION Work with PFA inside a chemical safety cabinet.
 (iv) Sucrose gradient: the next day, discard the PFA supernatant and wash the orga-
 noids twice with 1 mL of PBS, allowing the organoids to settle to the bottom of the
 tube between washes. Aspirate PBS carefully to avoid removing organoids.
 (v) Sequentially add and remove 1 mL of 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose solutions, allowing
 organoids to settle to the bottom between each step (30–40 min per step). Discard
 the supernatant after each step.
 (vi) OCT embedding: transfer organoids to a cryosection mold, remove residual
 sucrose solution and slowly fill the mold with OCT, avoiding bubbles. Position
 organoids in the center of the mold using a P20 pipette tip.
 (vii) Flash freeze the mold containing OCT and organoids by placing it on dry ice.
 ■ PAUSE POINT Store the mold at −80 °C until cryosectioning. Tissue samples
 embedded in OCT cryomolds can stored at −80 °C and remain stable for several years.
 (viii) Cryosectioning: use a cryostat to cut 15–20-μm-thick sections and place them
 onto positively charged microscope slides. Use an anti-fold tool to prevent section
 folding.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Make sure microscope slides have a positively charged coating
 for tissue adhesion. We use Superfrost Plus Microscope Slides (Fisher). During
 immunostaining, tissue sections will probably detach from uncoated slides.
 (ix) Store the slides with sections at −20° C until used for immunohistochemistry.
 (x) Immunohistochemistry: defrost slides containing tissue sections with a lumen at
 room temperature for 10 min.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
 (xi) Wash the slides with 0.1 M glycine in PBS.

 temperature.
 (xiii) Dilute primary antibodies in 3% BSA with 0.3% Triton-X 100 in PBS. Cover the
 sections and incubate overnight at 4 °C in a humidifying chamber to prevent the
 antibody solution from drying out (see Table 1 for antibodies used).
 (xiv) The next day, wash the sections with PBS for 15 min at room temperature.
 (xv) Dilute secondary antibodies (Table 1) in 3% BSA with 0.3% Triton-X 100 in PBS and
 incubate in darkness for 1–2 h at room temperature.
 (xvi) Wash the sections three times with PBS.

 Option D: slicing and patch-clamp electrophysiology
 ● TIMING 1 d
 (i) Organoid preparation and mounting: transfer a 5-month-old organoid to a 6 cm
 dish with ice-cold, oxygenated cutting ACSF using a P1000 pipette tip cut to avoid
 damaging the organoid.
 (ii) Prepare the vibratome by wiping the vibratome chamber with Kimwipes and
 coating the post with a thin layer of superglue.
 (iii) Mount the organoid on the glue-coated post using a plastic spatula (Fig. 9a). To pre-
 vent the organoid from sticking to the spatula, dip the spatula into PBS containing
 0.5% BSA before use. Allow the organoid to attach firmly to the post.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
 (iv) Fill the vibratome chamber with ice-cold, oxygenated cutting ACSF. Connect tub-
 ing to the vibratome chamber to bubble cutting ACSF with carbogen during slicing.
 (v) Slicing: cut 350-µm-thick slices using the vibratome set to 100 Hz frequency,
 1.2 mm amplitude and a slow (3–6 mm/min) forward movement velocity (Fig. 9b).
 (vi) Stop the vibratome after each slice. Under a magnifying glass, use a bent insulin
 needle to separate the slice from the remaining tissue, and transfer the slice into a
 maintenance beaker with bubbling ACSF using a wide Pasteur pipette. Try to keep the
 slices in an upside-down orientation in the maintenance beaker (with the surface that
 was in contact with the blade facing upward) relative to their original position during
 slicing. Approximately six slices can be prepared from a 5-month-old organoid.
 (vii) Maintain the collected slices in the beaker placed in a water bath at 35 °C for
 ~30 min. Then keep the beaker with slices at room temperature for the duration of
 the experiment.
 (viii) Patch-clamp experiment: transfer a slice into the recording chamber using a wide
 Pasteur pipette. Place a harp slice grid over the slice to hold it in place during the
 experiment and start perfusion with oxygenated ACSF at a flow rate of ~3 mL/min.
 (ix) Prepare a patch pipette from a thin-walled borosilicate glass tube with an access
 resistance of 5–8 MΩ, measured when the pipette is filled with a standard potas-
 sium-based intracellular solution and immersed in ACSF in the recording chamber.
 (x) Using a 10× objective, identify an area in the slice with clear lamination. Switch to
 a 40× water-immersive objective to inspect the area and identify a healthy neuron
 for patching.
 (xi) Before inserting the pipette into the ACSF, apply a light positive pressure. Locate
 the pipette tip on the monitor screen and begin moving toward the slice surface
 while adjusting the focus to keep the tip in view.
 (xii) Slowly approach the selected neuron, positioning the patch pipette diagonally
 relative to the neuron (Fig. 9c). Move forward diagonally at a very slow speed until a
 pressure-induced dimple is visible on the cell surface.
 (xiii) Release the positive pressure and apply light negative pressure using suction to
 facilitate seal formation between the pipette and the plasma membrane. Avoid suc-
 tioning the membrane into the pipette to prevent membrane closure and unstable
 input resistance during recording.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
 (xiv) Change the pipette potential step-wise (ΔV = −10 mV) to negative values (−50 to
 −70 mV) to facilitate the formation of the Giga seal.
 (xv) After forming the Giga seal, apply several brief, strong negative suction pulses to
 rupture the plasma membrane inside the pipette. Monitor the increase in capaci-
 tance transient to confirm membrane rupture and establishment of the ‘whole-cell’
 patch-clamp configuration.
 (xvi) Once a ‘whole-cell’ patch-clamp configuration is established, record the cell in ‘current-
 clamp’ mode to measure voltage deflections in response to different somatic current
 injections while holding the cell at negative membrane potential (–60 to –70 mV).
 (xvii) Use the AllenSDK ephys package (Allen SDK, 2015) for experimental protocol
 design and analysis (Fig. 9e).

Protocol


Anticpated results

The described protocol should yield telencephalic brain organoids with a predictable
organization relative to SNR and reproducible cell composition, which can be
determined using the mutual information index and z-score on scRNA-seq datasets
obtained from multiple organoids43,93. Our success rate for producing organoids with a
single clearly visible lumen was ~50% (49.2 ± 2.6%; 95% confidence interval: 43.9–54.5%), as
determined using 1-month-old organoids produced from the H9 embryonic stem cell line
and multiple different induced PS cell lines and widefield microscopy43. The success rate
depends on the size and quality of SNRs—those from sparce cultures, >200 μm in diameter
and with a clearly-distinguishable single lumen most often resulted in organoids with a single
clearly visible lumen (Fig. 3). SNRs isolated from clusters of NRs frequently transformed into
organoids with multiple lumens, while smaller SNRs failed to grow in suspension and produce
organoids (Fig. 4).
 Although most organoids were generated from radially organized and relatively
uniform SNRs, individual isolated SNRs grown on shaker transformed into organoids with
different organizations of cells relative to the lumen. In some organoids, the lumen remained
positioned at the center over the course of differentiation (Fig. 3, Rosette 1, 2 and 5), while in
other organoids, the lumen shifted to the side (Fig. 3, Rosette 3 and 4). We determined that
FGF2 is required to support the initial organoid growth in suspension; however, the factors
influencing the lumen position and organoid cytoarchitectural organizations remain to be
determined.
 We can maintain SNR-derived organoids in suspension culture on an orbital shaker
for up to 9 months post-induction; however, the majority of characterization experiments
have been performed on 1-month-old (before MG embedding) and 5-month old (4 months
post MG embedding) organoids43. The 1-month-old organoids should consist of pallial
(FOXG1-, PAX6- and TBR2-expressing) and subpallial LGE (FOXG1-, GSX2-, ASCL1- and
DLX1/2-expressing) neural progenitors, as well as cortical excitatory (TBR1-expressing) and
telencephalic inhibitory (GAD67- and CTIP2-expressing) neurons (Fig. 7b,c). They should not
contain cells expressing mesodermal, endodermal or posterior brain markers (Fig. 7c). In
addition, cells in 1-month-old SNR-derived organoid should exhibit a predictable organization
relative to the lumen: neural progenitors, expressing markers such as SOX2, PAX6, pVIM
and pH3, should reside in the ventricular-like zone, located directly adjacent to the lumen
(Fig. 8a), and neurons expressing MAP2 should be distributed more peripherally, outside the
ventricular-like zone (Fig. 8a).
 The 5-month-old organoids should consist of different subtypes of cortical
excitatory and striatal inhibitory neurons as well as glial cells (Fig. 7e). Neurons in
5-month-old organoids should exhibit expression of synaptic and activity-regulated genes
(Fig. 7e), display punctate localization of synaptic proteins (Fig. 8b) and demonstrate
functional activity by firing diverse patterns of action potentials in response to somatic
depolarization (Fig. 9d). Interestingly, many cells in 5-month-old organoids express primatespecific activity-regulated gene, OSTN (Osteocrin)94 and genes associated with autism and
schizophrenia95,96, indicating their potential for studying neuronal activity and modeling
psychiatric disorders (Fig. 7e). Both transcriptional and electrophysiological properties
of cells observed in SNR-derived organoids are available on the UBrain browser we developed
