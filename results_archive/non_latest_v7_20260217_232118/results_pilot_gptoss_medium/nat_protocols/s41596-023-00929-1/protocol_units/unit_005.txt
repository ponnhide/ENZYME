24. After samples have finished spinning, discard supernatant.
25. Resuspend in ~200 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.
26. Add the master mix into the tube of resuspended cells.
27. Incubate for 15 min on ice. During this sample incubation, start preparing controls by
 following Steps 36–45.
28. Wash with 5 mL of HBSS/BSA/glucose and mix.
29. Spin down for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.
30. Discard supernatant.
 • Note the amount of supernatant remaining in the tube; 500 µL of supernatant is
 needed to resuspend
 • Add additional HBSS/BSA/glucose if below the recommended 500 µL needed to
 resuspend
31. Resuspend cells.
32. Obtain one FACS tube and a 70 µm filter.
33. With the filter over the FACS tube, dispense the resuspended cells through the filter and into
 the FACS tube.
34. Seal the tube and place on ice.
 ▲ Critical step Cells should be analyzed as soon as possible. Longer periods of
 dissociation may compromise cell viability.
35. Take samples to FACS.
