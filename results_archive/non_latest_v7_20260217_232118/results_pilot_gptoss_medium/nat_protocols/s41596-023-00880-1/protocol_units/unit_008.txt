Day 27: prepare two 15 mL conical tubes for the ‘test’ (with albumin) and ‘control’ (without albumin) conditions, each containing 4 mL of E6 medium.
Add 4 µL of TRITC–albumin to 4 mL of E6 within ‘test’ conical tube (1:1,000 dilution).
Remove a Transwell plate with six wells of day 27 (equivalent to D13 + 14 in the original related research6) PT‑enhanced organoids from the incubator. Label three wells ‘test’ and three wells ‘control’.
Aspirate culture medium from wells then add TRITC–albumin to ‘test’ wells and plain E6 to ‘control’ wells, first adding a drop on top of each organoid, then dispensing the remaining 1 mL to the basolateral compartment of each Transwell.
Incubate the organoids overnight (~16–20 h) in a 37 °C incubator, during which time the DAPI uptake assay below (Steps 62–73) can be performed on the remaining six wells of live organoids in culture.
