Prepare three 15 mL conical tubes for the ‘substrate’ (with DAPI), ‘inhibitor’ (cimetidine) and ‘substrate + inhibitor’ (DAPI + cimetidine) conditions, each containing 4 mL of E6 medium and 4 µL of DRAQ7 dead cell stain (1:1,000 dilution).
Add 4 µL of DAPI to ‘substrate’ and ‘substrate + inhibitor’ tubes containing 4 mL of E6 (1:1,000 dilution). Mix well.
Add 4 μL of 100 mM cimetidine to ‘inhibitor’ and ‘substrate + inhibitor’ tubes containing 4 mL of E6 (1:1,000 dilution, final concentration 100 µM). Mix well.
Incubate the organoids for 30 min in a 37 °C incubator.
Following incubation, aspirate the inhibitor medium from the control wells, as well as the E6 culture medium from the three test wells.
Add ‘substrate’ medium to the three test wells and ‘substrate + inhibitor’ medium to the three control wells, first adding a drop on top of each organoid, then dispensing the remaining 1 mL to the basolateral compartment of each Transwell.
Incubate the organoids for 1 h in a 37 °C incubator.
