Retrieve the PFA‑fixed organoids from Step 53 stored in PBS. If the organoids have not yet been removed from the Transwell inserts, prepare a 48‑well plate with 0.5 mL PBS per well.
Lift each Transwell insert from the six‑well Transwell plate and use a sharp scalpel blade to cut the Transwell surrounding each organoid in a small square.
Replace the PBS with 200 µL per well of blocking solution and incubate on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 3–5 h.
Add 150 µL of primary antibody solution to each well and incubate overnight (~16 h) on a rocking platform at 4 °C.
After the final wash, add 150 µL of secondary antibody solution to each well and incubate overnight (~16 h) on a rocking platform at 4 °C (preferably in the dark to further prevent light exposure).
