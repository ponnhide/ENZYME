Top up the medium volume in each tube to 200 µL with E6/2% FBS.
Centrifuge tubes three times at 300g for 3 min, rotating the tubes 180° between each centrifugation step.
Following the third centrifugation, use a P200 pipette with a wide‑bore tip to gently push each cell pellet down to the base of the tube and aspirate the micromass into the pipette tip opening.
