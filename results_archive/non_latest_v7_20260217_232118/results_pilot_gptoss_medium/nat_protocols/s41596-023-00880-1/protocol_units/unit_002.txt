Incubate plate at 37 °C for 3 min.
While the cells are incubating, place 1 mL of room temperature E6 containing 2% FBS into a 15 mL conical tube (one tube for every three or four wells of a 12-well plate).
Gently detach the cells from the well surface by pipetting up and down a maximum of six times using a P1000 pipette, dissociating to a single-cell suspension.
Resuspend the cell pellet to a final volume of 2 mL of E6/2% FBS final volume, adding the medium gradually with a P1000 pipette and gently triturating the pellet during medium addition to resuspend to a single-cell suspension using minimal pipetting.
