Aspirate the primary antibody dilution and wash three times with 500 µl of blocking solution.

Aspirate the blocking solution after the third washing step and add 500 µl of secondary antibody dilution (for details, see antibody table). Incubate for 1 h at RT and protect from light.

CRITICAL Keep plate in the dark from now on because secondary antibodies are light sensitive and will bleach out, resulting in signal loss later.
