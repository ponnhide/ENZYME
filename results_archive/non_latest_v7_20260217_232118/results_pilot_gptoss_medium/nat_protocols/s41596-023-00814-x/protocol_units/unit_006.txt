Dilute the ﬁrst primary antibody as recommended, for example, OCT4 in blocking buffer. Recommended markers to check for pluripotency of human iPSCs are OCT4 (POU5F1), Nanog, SSEA4, Tra-1-60 and/or Tra-1-81.

Aspirate the blocking solution and add 200 µl of antibody dilution into a well. Incubate at RT for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C in a refrigerator or cold room.
