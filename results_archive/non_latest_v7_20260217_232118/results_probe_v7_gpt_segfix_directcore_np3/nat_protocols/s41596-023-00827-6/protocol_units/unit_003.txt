8 Reverse transcribe 100–1,000 ng of total RNA using the qScript XLT cDNA SuperMix. Combine following reagents in 0.2 ml microtubes:

Component Volume for 20 μl reaction

qScript XLT cDNA SuperMix 4 μl
RNA template Variable
RNase‑/DNase‑free water Variable
Total volume 20 μl

9 After sealing each reaction, vortex gently to mix contents. Centrifuge briefly to collect components at the bottom of the reaction tube.
10 Incubate as follows: 5 min at 25 °C, 60 min at 42 °C, 5 min at 85 °C, hold at 4 °C. Use first‑strand product for RT–qPCR amplification.
11 For RT–qPCR, prepare technical triplicates of 15 μl reaction:

Component Volume for 15 μl reaction

Sybr green 7.5 μl
Forward primer (from 0.15 μl 10 μM stock)
Reverse primer (from 0.15 μl 10 μM stock)
cDNA Variable
Water Variable
Total volume 15 μl

12 Prepare samples in a 384‑well plate and run for 40 cycles. Use primers listed in Table 1. Calculate relative gene expression on the basis of the average cycle (Ct) value, normalized to GAPDH as the internal control and reported as fold change (2(-ddCT)).
