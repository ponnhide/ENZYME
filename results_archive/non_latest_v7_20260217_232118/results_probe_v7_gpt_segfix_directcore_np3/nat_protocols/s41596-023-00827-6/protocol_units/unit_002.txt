1 Aspirate the medium from the insert with lung organoid and add 300 μl of Trizol to the insert using a P1000. Pipette up and down several times to break the Matrigel and collect the content of the insert. Transfer the organoid in trizol into a 1.5 ml tube and vortex until homogenized.
2 Centrifuge the sample at 16,000g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the residual Matrigel. Take the supernatant and mix with equal amount of 100% ethanol and vortex thoroughly.
3 Transfer the mixture into a Zymo‑Spin IC Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30 s at 16,000g. Transfer the column into a new collection tube and discard the flow through.
4 In an RNase‑free tube, add 5 μl DNase I (6 U/μl), 35 μl DNA Digestion Buffer and mix by gentle inversion. Add the mix directly to the column matrix. Incubate at room temperature (20–30 °C) for 15 min.
5 Add 400 μl Direct‑zol RNA PreWash to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow through and repeat this step.
6 Add 700 μl RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 1 min to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Transfer the column carefully into an RNase‑free tube.
7 To elute RNA, add 15 μl of DNase‑/RNase‑free water directly to the column matrix and centrifuge.
