We maintain hPSCs on feeder cells. The protocol begins with mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) depletion (d1, Fig. 1b, i) followed by a stepwise, sequential induction of DE (d0–4, Fig. 1b, ii) and AFE (d5–6, Fig. 1b, iii) as previously described20,61. hPSCs are passaged on Matrigel-coated plates to deplete residual MEFs for ~24 h (Steps 1–13). After MEF depletion, primitive streak and embryoid body induction is performed in embryoid bodies/primitive streak (EB/PS) medium in ultralow‑attachment plates for 12–16 h (Steps 14–27). This is followed by switching to DE induction medium for another 76–80 h (d4; Steps 28–42). Essential in this step is exposure to high concentrations of Activin A. DE can be generated both in 2D adherent cultures and or in 3D as EBs in low‑attachment plates. We found that lung potential is maintained the best in EBs. DE purity is verified by flow cytometry after staining for EPCAM, cKIT and CXCR4 (Steps 43–66)20,61. It is essential that more than 90% of the cells express high levels of these three markers. High‑purity DE (>90%) is directed to AFE via inhibition of TGF‑β, BMP and WNT signaling by SB 431542, NOGGIN and IWP2, respectively (Steps 67–89)29,30,61. At the end of AFE induction (d6), cells are treated with ventralization medium in the presence of BMP4, FGF10, FGF7, all‑trans retinoic acid (RA) and the glycogen synthase kinase 3β antagonist, CHIR for 48 h (Steps 90–92). At this time, formation of loosely adherent clumps can be observed (Fig. 1b, iv). Next, LBOs are generated (Steps 93–99). This is accomplished by resuspending clumps of cells at d8 and maintaining those in ultra‑low‑attachment plates in the presence of CHIR, FGF10, FGF7, BMP4 and RA, where they will form spheres consisting of folding epithelial sheets interspersed with mesenchymal cells (Fig. 1b, v, vi and Fig. 3b). The majority of the epithelial cells will express early, but not mature lung markers, and have an expression profile consistent with lung bud epithelium. The mesenchymal cells express markers consistent with pulmonary mesenchyme, and can make up 5–20% of the population by flow cytometry20. In the final stage (Steps 100–117), the LBOs are plated in Matrigel with CHIR, FGF10, FGF7, BMP4 and RA, where they undergo outward budding followed by a process similar to branching morphogenesis (Fig. 1b, vii, viii).
