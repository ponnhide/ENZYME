1 Wash hPSCs with 0.5 mM EDTA by removing E8 medium and replacing it with 0.6 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA per well of a 6-well plate.
2 Aspirate the EDTA solution, add 0.6 mL of Accutase per well and incubate for 3–5 min at 37 °C. Closely monitor cells under the tissue culture microscope until the cells start to round up.
3 Dissociate the cells from the plate with a P1000 pipette and pipette the cells gently up and down (2–3×) to break up aggregates and to generate single cells.
