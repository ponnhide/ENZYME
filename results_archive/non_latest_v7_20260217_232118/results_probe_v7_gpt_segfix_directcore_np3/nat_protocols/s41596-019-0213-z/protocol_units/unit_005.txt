18 Calculate the number of wells of a 12‑well plate needed for aggregate embedding. We embed one full 6‑well plate of aggregates in one entire 12‑well plate. This usually corresponds to 40–60 aggregates per well.
19 Calculate the total amount of collagen I–Matrigel solution needed. We use 1 mL per well (in total; 0.5 mL per well for layer 1 + 0.5 mL per well for layer 2, e.g., one entire 12‑well plate will require 12 mL of collagen I–Matrigel solution: 6 mL for layer 1 (4.5 mL of collagen I solution + 1.5 mL of Matrigel) + 6 mL (4.5 mL of collagen I solution + 1.5 mL of Matrigel) for layer 2).
20 Thaw the required Matrigel aliquots on ice.
21 Pipette the collagen I solution as described above. Carefully mix by pipetting up and down after adding PureCol.
22 Pipette the exact amount of collagen I solution into a fresh 15‑mL Falcon tube and place it on ice.
23 Add Matrigel to collagen I solution and mix thoroughly by carefully pipetting up and down.
24 Add 0.5 mL of collagen I/Matrigel solution per 12‑well plate and swirl the plate equally to distribute the solution in the wells.
25 Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 2 h for solidiﬁcation.
