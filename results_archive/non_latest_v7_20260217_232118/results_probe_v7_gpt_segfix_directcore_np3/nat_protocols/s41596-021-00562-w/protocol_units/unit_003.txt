7 Prepare the Click-iT reaction cocktail containing 1× Click-iT reaction buffer, CuSO4, Alexa Fluor azide and reaction buffer additive, according to the manufacturer’s procedure.
8 Aspirate permeabilization solution, and wash the monolayers at least twice with 3% BSA in DPBS−/−. Add 500 µl of the Click-iT reaction cocktail to the apical side of the monolayer. Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.
CRITICAL Incubation step must be performed protected from light.
9 Aspirate the Click-iT reaction cocktail, and wash at least twice with 3% BSA in DPBS−/−.
