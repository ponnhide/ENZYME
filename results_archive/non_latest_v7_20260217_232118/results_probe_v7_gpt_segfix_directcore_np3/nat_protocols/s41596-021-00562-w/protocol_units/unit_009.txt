24 Incubate the resuspended Matrigel in the ice bucket for 45–60 min, or until Matrigel is dissolved. Mix the Matrigel–CRS solution via gentle inversion every 10–15 min. Organoids will settle at the bottom of the tube when Matrigel is fully dissolved.
CRITICAL Do not exceed 60 min of incubation as this can decrease cell viability. Do not vortex the organoid suspension.
25 Centrifuge at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, there should be a noticeable organoid pellet, ~200 µl volume of organoid, depending on the density of the original culture. During centrifugation, prepare the material for the subsequent steps: sterilize a glass dish with PREempt disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol. Add ice to 50–70% capacity of the glass dish, spray with 70% ethanol again and place the dish into the biosafety cabinet. Put Matrigel aliquots into the aluminum cooling block. Spray thoroughly with 70% ethanol, and place it into the glass dish containing the ice.
CRITICAL Ice is not sterile; use with extra caution in the biosafety cabinet.
27 Calculate the volume needed for the desired splitting ratio allowing 50 μl of Matrigel per well (i.e., 1.2 ml Matrigel per 24-well plate). A typical splitting ratio is 1:3 to 1:5, but this varies and depends on the density of the original culture, length of culture since original thaw, and donor intrinsic growth behavior.
