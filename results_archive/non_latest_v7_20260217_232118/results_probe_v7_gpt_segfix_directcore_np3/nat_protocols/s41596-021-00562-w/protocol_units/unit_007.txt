11 Resuspend the organoid pellet with 1.2 ml of Matrigel and seed 50 µl droplets into each well of an Olympus 24-well, tissue culture treated plate.
CRITICAL It is important to use Olympus 24-well tissue culture treated plates as they keep the Matrigel droplets spherical, which is critical for 3D organoid growth.
12 Carefully transfer the plate(s) containing Matrigel droplets to the CO2 incubator. Incubate for 15–20 min to allow Matrigel gelation. After 15–20 min, check the Matrigel gelation by tilting the plates. If the Matrigel holds firm, they should be ready.
13 Place the plate(s) inside the biosafety cabinet and add 600 µl of colon organoid medium to each well. Carefully dispense the medium into the side of the well to avoid disturbing the Matrigel droplet.
