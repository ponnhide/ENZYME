19 Prepare colon organoid growth medium (15 ml for every 24-well plate) by first making up base medium, as described in Table 2, and then using this as a component of colon organoid growth medium, made as described in Table 3. Alternatively, this medium can be prepared during CRS incubation (Step 24).
20 Collect organoid droplets using the medium in which they are currently growing. Using a 1,000 µl pipette, set the pipette to 650 µl (there should be a maximum volume in each well of 50 µl Matrigel and 600 µl medium). Scrape the bottom of the well with the pipette tip to dislodge the Matrigel.
22 Aspirate the supernatant (spent organoid growth medium) with vacuum using a sterile Pasteur pipette.
23 Resuspend the Matrigel pellet in CRS using a 1:10 dilution. For a full 24-well plate of organoids, use 12 ml of CRS. Resuspend the Matrigel droplet by gently inverting the 15 ml conical tube.
