2 Add 500 µl of the 1× EdU in base medium solution onto the apical side of the monolayer, and 1.5 ml of the 1× EdU in colon monolayer differentiation medium onto the basolateral side of the monolayer.
3 Return monolayers to the incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C), and incubate overnight (16 h).
CRITICAL The incubation time can be increased or decreased depending on the proliferative state of the donor/cells being used, but it needs to be kept consistent across all time points and samples in any given experiment.
4 Once incubation period is complete, remove the medium from both sides of the monolayer, and replace it with ﬁxative solution (4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS−/−), with 500 µl on both the apical and basolateral sides of the monolayer. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.
