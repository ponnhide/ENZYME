Procedure
 1 Make a 10 μM (1×) solution of EdU in both base medium and colon monolayer differentiation medium by diluting the 10 mM (1,000×) stock
 solution of EdU (component A of the kit).
 2 Add 500 µl of the 1× EdU in base medium solution onto the apical side of the monolayer, and 1.5 ml of the 1× EdU in colon monolayer
 differentiation medium onto the basolateral side of the monolayer.
 3 Return monolayers to the incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C), and incubate overnight (16 h).
 CRITICAL The incubation time can be increased or decreased depending on the proliferative state of the donor/cells being used, but it needs
 c


 to be kept consistent across all time points and samples in any given experiment.
 4 Once incubation period is complete, remove the medium from both sides of the monolayer, and replace it with ﬁxative solution (4%
 paraformaldehyde in DPBS−/−), with 500 µl on both the apical and basolateral sides of the monolayer. Incubate at room temperature for
 15 min.
 5 Aspirate the ﬁxative solution, and wash the monolayers at least twice with 3% BSA in DPBS−/− (1 ml on the apical side, 2 ml on the basolateral
 side of the monolayer).
 6 Add 500 µl of the permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton X-100 in DPBS−/−) to both apical and basolateral sides of the monolayer. Incubate at
 room temperature for 20 min.
 7 Prepare the Click-iT reaction cocktail containing 1× Click-iT reaction buffer, CuSO4, Alexa Fluor azide and reaction buffer additive, according to
 the manufacturer’s procedure.
 8 Aspirate permeabilization solution, and wash the monolayers at least twice with 3% BSA in DPBS−/−. Add 500 µl of the Click-iT reaction
 cocktail to the apical side of the monolayer. Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.
 CRITICAL Incubation step must be performed protected from light.
 c


 9 Aspirate the Click-iT reaction cocktail, and wash at least twice with 3% BSA in DPBS−/−.
 10 If additional staining is desired, follow Steps 106–112 of the main procedure described in the section ‘Sample preparation for immunoﬂuorescent
 imaging’.
 11 After carrying out any additional staining, or immediately after Step 9, immerse monolayers in DPBS−/− (applying 500 µl to the apical and
 1,500 µl basolateral sides), and proceed with imaging and analysis.
 PAUSE POINT If you wish to delay imaging, store monolayers at 4 °C. To prevent fading, store monolayers protected from light and
 j


 image within 1 week. If you wish to store monolayers for longer than a week before imaging, mount on glass microscope slides as described in
 Steps 114–120.


 Experimental design
 The procedure comprises several stages (Fig. 1) that start with established organoids in 3D culture.
 We ﬁrst describe how to maintain, passage and expand organoids, and then we describe how
 organoids are dissociated to generate single cells for seeding into Transwells inserts and generating
 functional colon monolayers. Finally, we outline the medium regime to differentiate epithelial
 monolayers prior to the addition of bacteria. To evaluate the integrity of the epithelial monolayers, we
 suggest monitoring the TEER values at various time points. We also suggest to only use intact
 monolayers that show an increase in TEER values over time. Alternatively, the epithelial barrier
 integrity can also be evaluated using other assays, such as the leakage of Lucifer yellow from the apical
 to the basolateral side. The proliferative state of the monolayers can be evaluated using commercially
 available proliferative kits, such as the incorporation of nucleotide analogs during DNA synthesis
 (EdU staining) described in Box 1.


 Coculture
 As an example, we describe how to coculture epithelial monolayers with engineered B. thetaiotao-
 micron bacteria. The bacterium B. thetaiotaomicron was engineered with genetic circuits that can turn
 on different programs in response to different external environments, where the output of the circuit
 is reported via expression and activity of luciferase. A logic circuit that could report the presence of
 either secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA) or anhydrotetracycline (aTc), or the absence
 of either, was engineered into B. thetaiotaomicron10. The circuit was tested using luciferase as the
 sole reporter; hence, three strains were required to measure the individual outputs as described
 previously10. An additional strain of B. thetaiotaomicron (MT768) was constructed to constantly
 express luciferase and was used as a control for standardization of the luciferase activity. The multi-
 input, multi-output, logic system was built using a combination of three NOR gates built with

NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL
 CRISPRi-dCas9, integrated into DCA and aTc sensors as inputs and three different output promoters.
 This resulted in three bacterial strains (MT798, MT799 and MT800) that have the same circuit but
 report only one of the three output promoters10. For the experimental setup, four separate bacterial
 cocultures (M768, M798, M799 and MT800) were started once the monolayers showed signs of
 differentiation (an increase in TEER values over time, which generally takes 7 d). After 2 h of
 bacterial–epithelial coculture, the bacterial genetic circuits were induced by the addition of inducers.
 Each strain was exposed to the four combinations of inducers (i.e., 62.5 µM DCA, 100 ng μl−1 aTc,
 DCA+aTc, and none (as a control)).

 Evaluation of coculture
 Eight hours after the start of coculture (i.e., 6 h after introduction of the inducers), we evaluated
 the effects of the different culture conditions on bacterial growth, gene circuit activation and
 epithelial monolayer integrity. The bacteria cell density was measured using optical density at
 600 nm. The gene circuit activation by the inducers was determined by measuring the luciferase
 activity in each strain and condition using the NanoLuc luciferase assay. The resulting bacteria
 cell density and the luminescence in the test (MT798, MT799 and MT800) and control bacterial
 strains (MT768) were used to calculate the output of the gene circuit, which was designated as relative
 promoter units (RPULs). In our experimental setting, the RPUL for each strain was greatest when
 exposed to the inducer corresponding to its designed genetic circuit compared with other inducers;
 e.g., strain MT798 exhibited greater output in response to DCA compared with aTC along, aTC plus
 DCA, or no inducer. In addition, the integrity of the epithelial monolayer was monitored via TEER
 measurement and then characterized by immunoﬂuorescent staining to identify the location of
 bacteria in the epithelium–bacteria coculture system (Fig. 1). We did not undertake additional
 characterization of the epithelial monolayer permeability using molecular tracers; however, this
 can be employed30. More detailed phenotypic insights can also be obtained by analyzing the
 mucin production and harvesting the epithelial monolayer to conduct expression analysis via
 RNAseq or qPCR26.


 Limitations
 A current limitation of the Transwell system is that it does not provide dynamic control of nutrient
 renewal, which can result in bacterial overgrowth within 10–12 h of culture. A short (<8 h) timescale
 is sufﬁcient for testing the responses of engineered bacteria to speciﬁc inducers, but may limit other
 applications requiring longer periods of culture. This limitation can be overcome by integrating the
 Transwell monolayer into a microphysiological system that controls apical ﬂow to provide con-
 tinuous nutrient replenishment for the bacterial compartment26. Another limitation of the Transwell
 monolayer is that the apical compartment is not anaerobic and thus can only be used for culturing
 aerotolerant bacteria such as B. thetaiotaomicron, B. fragilis, Biﬁdobacteria and Lactobacillus. This
 challenge has been overcome by incorporating Transwell monolayers into a specialized micro-
 physiological systems26. For the very short term (a few hours), a system without apical ﬂow allows
 acute responses to be assessed18,20,43,55. For the longer term (hours to days) a device called gut-
 microbe (GuMI) with anaerobic apical ﬂow and aerobic basal ﬂow maintains an oxygen gradient
 across the epithelial barrier similar to a healthy colon in vivo, enabling successful days-long coculture
 of colon epithelial cells with oxygen-sensitive bacteria, such as F. prausnitzii and Eubacterium rec-
 tale26. Collectively, the studies described above exemplify the potentially wide application of the
 epithelial monolayer method described in this protocol.
 Donor-to-donor variability can also affect the success of establishing functional epithelial
 monolayers. Although we did not exhaustively test many donors for monolayer formation, we
 observed a variability in the successful rate of monolayer generation from three different donors
 tested (Fig. 2 and Source Data Fig. 2). For example, the successful rate for generating usable
 monolayers from one donor was only 33% compared with another donor in which all monolayers
 were usable (100%). The variability we have seen is not due to reagents or organoid culture condi-
 tions, since donors that have lower monolayer formation efﬁciency could be maintained as organoids
 in Matrigel. We speculate that intrinsic donor properties as well as the removal of Matrigel that
 supply unknown factors during organoid culture can account for the variability in monolayer for-
 mation. Therefore, we recommend that users perform pilot experiments with organoids from mul-
 tiple donors to test monolayer formation efﬁciency and monolayer stability prior to establishing
 coculture experiments. In our experience, monolayers from donors with low monolayer formation

 Biological materials
 ● Colon organoids. Colon organoids used in this study were established by the Yilmaz lab at the Koch
 Institute/Massachusetts Institute of Technology and by the Breault lab at Boston Children’s Hospital.
 Details of individual organoids are given in Table 1. They were derived following the procedure
 available at http://breaultlab.org/progﬁles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/web_human-tissue-processing.
 pdf. To establish organoid cultures, endoscopic tissue biopsies were collected from the ascending colon
 of deidentiﬁed individuals at either Massachusetts General Hospital or Boston Children’s Hospital
 upon the donors’ informed consent. Methods were carried out in accordance with the Institutional
 Review Board of Boston Children’s Hospital (protocol number IRB-P00000529) and the Koch Institute
 Institutional Review Board Committee as well as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Committee
 on the use of humans as experimental subjects. Once organoids are established, they can be used for
 monolayer formation after two passages from thawing ! CAUTION The use of human tissues must
 follow all relevant ethical guidelines, and informed consent should be obtained from the tissue donors
 and the protocol approved by the research institution. Authenticity of the cells should be regularly
 checked (we undertake a morphology check by microscope), and cultures should be regularly tested for
 mycoplasma contamination. All work on primary cells should be performed in Biosafety Level 2
 laboratories or higher with proper precautions and personal protection equipment. All cell-containing
 samples need to be decontaminated upon disposal as biohazard materials.
 ● Bacteria of interest. We obtained glycerol stocks of B. thetaiotaomicron engineered to contain speciﬁc


 genetic circuits (MT768, MT798, MT799 and MT800) from the Voigt lab at the Massachusetts
 Institute of Technology. Full details of these bacteria are in ref. 10.
