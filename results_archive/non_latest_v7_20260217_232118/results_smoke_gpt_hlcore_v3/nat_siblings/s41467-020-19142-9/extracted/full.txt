 Tumor heterogeneity is a major cause of therapeutic resistance. Immunotherapy may exploit
 alternative vulnerabilities of drug-resistant cells, where tumor-speciﬁc human leukocyte
 antigen (HLA) peptide ligands are promising leads to invoke targeted anti-tumor responses.
 Here, we investigate the variability in HLA class I peptide presentation between different
 clonal cells of the same colorectal cancer patient, using an organoid system. While clone-
 speciﬁc differences in HLA peptide presentation were observed, broad inter-clone variability
 was even more prevalent (15–25%). By coupling organoid proteomics and HLA peptide
 ligandomics, we also found that tumor-speciﬁc ligands from DNA damage control and tumor
 suppressor source proteins were prominently presented by tumor cells, coinciding likely with
 the silencing of such cytoprotective functions. Collectively, these data illustrate the hetero-
 geneous HLA peptide presentation landscape even within one individual, and hint that a
 multi-peptide vaccination approach against highly conserved tumor suppressors may be a
 viable option in patients with low tumor-mutational burden.

and each tumor organoid line. In all comparisons, the majority of HLA peptide ligands (>6800) were presented by both normal colon organoids and tumor
organoid clones. b Peptide intensities plotted against the cumulative peptide rank. HLA peptide ligands identiﬁed from T1 were ranked by decreasing
intensity. On the representative trace of all T1 – HCD peptides (black), peptides that are unique to T1 and never detected from normal colon organoids are
annotated (blue). The spread of these T1 unique peptides over ranked intensity indicated that several T1 unique peptides are highly abundant. c Peptide
binding rank plotted against cumulative peptide rank. Peptide binding ranks were predicted using the NetMHC 4.0 pan algorithm. Peptides with a binding
rank below 0.5 are considered strong binder. Peptides with a binding rank between 0.5 and 2.0 are considered weak binders and all peptides with a binding
rank over 2.0 are considered non-binders. On the trace of all peptides identiﬁed (black), tumor-speciﬁc peptides that are never detected from the normal

Fig. 5 Clonal tumor HLA class I ligandomes over-represent peptides from DNA repair source proteins. a The MUC2 proteins were not detected in the
deep proteome analysis (left), but two HLA peptide ligands derived from MUC2 degradation were predominantly presented by all CRC tumor organoid
clones (right). For each peptide, normalized peptide intensities were summed from three replicated measurements by HCD (Exp1), or EThcD (Exp2),
respectively. b The DACH1 protein was similarly not detected in the deep proteome analysis (left), but consistently presented on all tumor organoid clones,
and consistently detected in both HCD and EThcD MS fragmentation methods. c Peptides derived from degradation of DNA damage sensors and repair
proteins were prominently presented by CRC organoid clones as HLA peptides. Signiﬁcant changes in protein abundance with respect to normal colon
organoids were determined based on three technical replicates with a two-sided student’s t test: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01. Data presented as mean values ±

though protein levels of MST1R, TRAF2, and TP53 were not signiﬁcantly different between the four CRC tumor organoid lines, presentation of peptide
