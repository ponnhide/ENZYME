Neural organoids were generated in 96-well plates, where pluripotent stem cells (WTC, H9 and HES3 lines; the latter modified to report the expression of the regional marker NKX2-1) were aggregated into embryoid bodies and cultured in minimal neural induction media (MNIM) to induce neuroectodermal fates (Fig. 1a).
