Tissue sections were snap frozen and stored at −80 °C. Nuclei were isolated from frozen tissues as described57. In brief, frozen tissue samples were thawed in 2 ml chilled homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.8, 5 mM CaCl2, 3 mM magnesium acetate, 320 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40, 167 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 16.7 μM PMSF) and lysed in a pre-chilled dounce. Cell lysates were then centrifuged in an iodixanol gradient for 20 min at 3,000g at 4 °C in a swinging bucket centrifuge with the brake turned off. The nucleus band was then carefully pipetted and nuclei were diluted in wash buffer.
