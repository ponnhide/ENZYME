The remaining variation in drug response did not, however, clearly relate to the geographical zones of origin or to the phylogenetic trees of each cancer. There were several examples of marked differences in drug sensitivity between closely related clones. For example, P2.T4.1 showed marked resistance to SN-38 compared to the other P2.T4 clones, whereas P3.T1.5 showed distinct sensitivity to 5-FU compared to all other clones from this individual (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 10a). The mechanism underlying this diversification in biological behaviour is unclear, but there was no obvious correlation with the degree of mutational diversification."
