On the day after seeding, media was removed and changed to growth media without Y-27632. On day 3 after seeding, media was removed and organoids were washed twice with Advanced DMEM/F12. After washing, media was replaced with organoid media without EGF to promote differentiation. Media was changed every 1–2 days, and cultures were maintained in the plates for up to 10 days before collection.
