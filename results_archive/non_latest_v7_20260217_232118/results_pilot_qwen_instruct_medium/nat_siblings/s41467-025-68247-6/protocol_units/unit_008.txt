Organoids that had been maintained in Cultrex domes for at least 5 days after passaging were removed from the ECM following the passaging protocol as above, but dissociated for 12 min in Trypsin rather than 6, or until organoids were largely single cells. Trypsin was neutralized and organoids were washed as in the passaging protocol.
