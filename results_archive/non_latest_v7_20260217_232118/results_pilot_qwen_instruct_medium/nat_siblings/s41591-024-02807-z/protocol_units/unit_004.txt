Immunostaining confirmed cell proliferation (Ki67) and lack of apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3) within AFOs (Fig. 2f). We confirmed the AFO’s epithelial identity by staining for pan-epithelial markers (EpCAM, E-CAD and pan-cytokeratin) and showing absence of the mesenchymal marker platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα).
