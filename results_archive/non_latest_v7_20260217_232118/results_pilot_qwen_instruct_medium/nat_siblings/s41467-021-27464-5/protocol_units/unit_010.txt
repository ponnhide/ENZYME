Raw base calls were demultiplexed and converted fastq files using cellranger mkfastq program (bcl2fastq 2.19/cellranger 3.0). Sequencing data were first preprocessed through the Cell Ranger pipeline (10x Genomics, Cellranger count v2) with default parameters (expect-cells set to the number of cells added to 10x system), aligned to GrCH38 (v3.1.0), and the resulting matrix files were used for subsequent bioinformatic analysis.
