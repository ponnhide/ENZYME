14 Before you start, take out the required amount of Matrigel aliquots from the freezer and let them thaw on ice. When the Matrigel is thawed, insert the aliquots into the ice. Take out the sterile scissors (heated to at least 180 °C for at least 3 h), and let them cool down at room temperature.
CRITICAL STEP Ensure the Matrigel is not growth-factor-reduced (use cat. no. 354234) and has an appropriate protein concentration; HFO formation has been validated with a Matrigel concentration range of 9.7–10.7 mg/mL. Do not use Geltrex instead of Matrigel since this will result in a failed differentiation based on our experience6.
15 In the meantime, take a look at the 96-U-well plate under the microscope to check if the hPSC aggregates have properly formed. Mark the properly formed aggregates (these will be further embedded in Matrigel) and cross out the rest (not round or too small aggregates; see Fig. 4b for examples; these aggregates can be discarded later).
CRITICAL STEP Embedding only properly formed aggregates (round, homogeneous, ~550–650 µm in diameter) is important.
