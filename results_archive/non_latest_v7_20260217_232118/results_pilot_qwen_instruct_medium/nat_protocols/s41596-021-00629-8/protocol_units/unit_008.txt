13 Centrifuge the plate at 300g and 4 °C for 3 min to bring the cells to the culture plate bottom, and place the plate into the incubator.
CRITICAL STEP Ensure that, after centrifugation, the hPSCs form a round cell pellet at the culture plate bottom as shown in Fig. 4a. Place the plate into the incubator very carefully, and do not move it for at least 24 h to ensure that one round aggregate will form per well overnight.
