To prepare 6 mL of collagen I–Matrigel solution (enough for one 12-well plate), thaw Matrigel
aliquots on ice. Pipette 4.5 mL of collagen I solution (2.0 mg/mL) into a fresh 15-mL Falcon tube and
place on ice. Add 1.5 mL of growth factor–reduced Matrigel on ice and mix gently. Keep solution on
ice until used for the embedding process CRITICAL Always prepare collagen I–Matrigel solution
fresh at the time of cell aggregate embedding (d5; Step18).
