11 One day after aggregates have formed (d0), transfer the aggregates to a 15-mL Falcon tube with a
10-mL serological pipette and wait for the aggregates to settle down by gravitation. Do not discard
the 6-well plate; save it for later aggregate replating.
CRITICAL STEP Gentle treatment of aggregates is important. Always collect aggregates by
gravitation. Centrifugation of cell aggregates is not recommended at any point in the protocol.

12 After cell aggregates have collected at the bottom of the 15-mL Falcon tube (this may take
15–20 min), carefully aspirate the medium.
13 Use a 10-mL serological pipette to gently resuspend the aggregates (3 mL per well) in N2B27
medium + 12 µM CHIR99021 + 30 ng/mL BMP-4 and transfer the aggregates back to the
low-attachment plate. Incubate the cells.
14 Use a P1000 pipette to quickly resuspend the aggregates once per day to avoid excessive fusion of
aggregates. Incubate for 3 d to induce mesodermal differentiation.

15 On day 3, transfer the aggregates to a 15-mL tube and wait for them to settle down by gravitation.
Do not discard the 6-well plate; save it for later aggregate replating.
16 After cell aggregates have collected at the bottom of the 15-mL Falcon tube, carefully aspirate the
medium.
17 Resuspend the aggregates (3 mL per well) in N2B27 medium + 100 ng/mL VEGF-A + 2 µM
forskolin and transfer the aggregates back to the low-attachment plates. Incubate for 2 more
days (Fig. 2c).
