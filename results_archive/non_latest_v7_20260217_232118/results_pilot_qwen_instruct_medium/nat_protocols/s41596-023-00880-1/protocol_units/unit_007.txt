Following the third centrifugation, use a P200 pipette with a wide-bore tip to gently push each cell pellet down to the base of the tube and aspirate the micromass into the pipette tip opening. ... perform a CHIR pulse by adding 1 mL of E6-containing 5 µM CHIR99021 to the base of the Transwell and incubating the cell micromasses for precisely 1 h in the 37 °C incubator.
