To aid in the removal of BME, top the volume up with 10 ml of ice-cold adDMEM/F12+++ medium. Centrifuge organoids at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant, and split organoids using either TrypLE (for head and neck and compact breast, colon, pancreatic and liver organoids) or mechanical disruption (ovarian and cystic breast, colon, pancreatic and liver organoids). For TrypLE-based cell dissociation, resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of TrypLE, pipette up and down and incubate at 37 °C until organoids fall apart.
