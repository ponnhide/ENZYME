4 Passage your iPSCs as usual and seed one drop of cell suspension with 1 ml serological pipette into each Matrigel-coated and mTeSR1 (including Rock inhibitor) filled well. Place the 24-well plate into the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) and do not move the plate for the next 24–48 h. Check for cell attachment after 2 d and then change medium daily.
