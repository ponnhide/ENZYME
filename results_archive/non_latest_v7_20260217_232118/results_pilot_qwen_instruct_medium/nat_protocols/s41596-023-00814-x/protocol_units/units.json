Remove slides from the solution and dry for 2–3 h at RT.\nPAUSE POINT Store dried slides in a box at RT for up to 3 months.\n10 Set up the cryosection machine (for example, Cryostat) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We recommend that the chamber and holder’s temperature is 20–25 °C, and the cutting thickness is 12–16 µm. Perform sectioning: place the specimen into the cryostat holder and use the trimming mode until the OVB organoid is seen (faint beige with black dots). Stop trimming and set up the cutting thickness between 12 and 16 µm, cut and place sections on the PLL precoated Superfrost slides. For this, keep the slides at RT, cut and then pick up the section with the RT warm slide. The frozen section will easily stick to the warm glass slide. Check for the correct orientation of the pigmented area. Let sections dry for 1 h at RT.

Note that nuclear staining in human organoids is challenging, and most of the retinal antibodies available are transcription factors, and thus are nuclear markers. Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval with sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6) and a microwave. Phalloidin staining requires 1 hour of incubation at RT and light protection. No secondary antibody staining is necessary since phalloidin is conjugated with the fluorophore (TRITC).\n19 Add 100 µl of antibody dilution onto each slide and cover slide with Paraﬁlm (cut into slide format).

      "text": "1 Collect up to three OVB organoids of the same batch in a sterile Rnase-free 1.5 ml tube. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for transferring organoids.\n2 Remove any carried-over medium carefully with a 200 µl micropipette tip without disturbing the organoids.\n3 Wash organoids once with cold PBS and withdraw PBS.\n4 Add 300 µl Tri-Reagent and incubate at RT for 5 min.\n5 Vortex tube three times for 5 s.\n6 Incubate the tube at RT for 5 min without agitation.\n7 Vortex tube three times for 5 s.\n8 Keep the tube on ice for 10 min.\n9 Vortex tube three times for 5 s.\n10 Keep the tube on ice for 10 min.\n11 Freeze organoids by a snap freeze on dry ice and store them at −80 °C overnight.\nPAUSE POINT Store organoids in Tri-Reagent at −80 °C for up to 6 months.\n12 Thaw organoids in Tri-reagent at RT.\n13 Vortex the tube times for 5 s.\n14 Pipette remaining cell clumps up and down for complete dissociation with 200 µl micropipette tips (filtered, Rnase-free tip).\n15 Perform phenol/chloroform extraction to separate nucleic acids from lipids and proteins. Extract RNA with a commercially available RNA extraction kit.\n16 Use 2 µg of total RNA to subselect poly(A)+ transcripts and generate strand-specific cDNA libraries.\n17 Sequence libraries to ~50 million read pairs each (75 bp reads) on a HiSeq4000 platform (Illumina).\n18 Assess data sequencing quality with FastQC and map paired-end sequencing reads with STAR aligner to Hg19 human reference assembly and quantified with featureCounts.\n19 Normalize raw read counts with the RUVSeq package in R to remove unwanted variation based on replicate samples (RUVs).\n20 Analyze changes in differential gene expression (DGE) with the DESeq2 package. The list of 3,923 significantly DGE genes (log2FC ±1.5 and padj ≤0.05 cutoff) is subjected to affinity propagation clustering based on similarity matrix, with the APcluster package.\n21 Generate a dendrogram with clusters, cutoff and superclusters, and use these for Gene Ontology term search analysis with clusterProfiler. Classify significant DGE genes in superclusters and subject them to gene set enrichment analysis with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (v3.0) using C5 collection of Gene Ontology gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database.",
