1 While culturing human iPSCs, prepare a sterile 24-well plate and place sterile glass coverslips (12 mm diameter) onto the bottom of each well.
Prepare at least six wells.
2 Add 300 µl Matrigel/DMEM/F12 solution, described in the Reagent setup, per well of the 24-well plate. Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in an incubator.
3 Aspirate the Matrigel solution and add 500 µl of mTESR1 medium and 10 µM Rock inhibitor (Y-27632 2HCl) per well.
