9 Coat Superfrost slides with PLL: dilute 0.1% PLL solution 1:10 in distilled water. Soak glass slides for 5 min in 0.01% PLL at RT. Remove slides from the solution and dry for 2–3 h at RT.
PAUSE POINT Store dried slides in a box at RT for up to 3 months.
10 Set up the cryosection machine (for example, Cryostat) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We recommend that the chamber and holder’s temperature is 20–25 °C, and the cutting thickness is 12–16 µm. Perform sectioning: place the specimen into the cryostat holder and use the trimming mode until the OVB organoid is seen (faint beige with black dots). Stop trimming and set up the cutting thickness between 12 and 16 µm, cut and place sections on the PLL precoated Superfrost slides. For this, keep the slides at RT, cut and then pick up the section with the RT warm slide. The frozen section will easily stick to the warm glass slide. Check for the correct orientation of the pigmented area. Let sections dry for 1 h at RT. Store cryosections at −80 °C until continuing the procedure, with a minimum of 2 h or long-term storage.
PAUSE POINT Samples can be stored for up to 1 year at −80 °C.
11 Before the immunostaining procedure, thaw the slides at RT and let them dry for 30 min.
12 Wash slides twice for 3 min with PBS. You can use a Coplin jar for washing or simply add 200 µl PBS on the lying slide.
13 Incubate slides with 1% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate in PBS for 5 min at RT.
14 Wash twice for 3 min with PBS.
15 Incubate with permeabilization solution for 10 min at RT.
16 Wash three time for 3 min with PBS-Glycine (0.225 g Glycine per 100 ml).
17 Incubate with blocking solution at RT for 1 h or at 4 °C overnight.
18 Dilute the primary antibodies in blocking solution (Table 3 or the manufacturer’s instructions). Note that nuclear staining in human organoids is challenging, and most of the retinal antibodies available are transcription factors, and thus are nuclear markers. Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval with sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6) and a microwave. Phalloidin staining requires 1 hour of incubation at RT and light protection. No secondary antibody staining is necessary since phalloidin is conjugated with the fluorophore (TRITC).
19 Add 100 µl of antibody dilution onto each slide and cover slide with Paraﬁlm (cut into slide format). Incubate at RT for a minimum of 2 h or at 4 °C overnight.
20 Collect the primary antibody solution. Primary antibody dilutions can be stored at 4 °C and reused up to three times within 3 months.
21 Wash three times for 5 min with blocking solution.
22 Add the corresponding secondary antibody solution mixed with DAPI (dilution for both is 1:500 in blocking solution) and incubate for 1–2 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C protected from light.
! CAUTION Fluorophores of secondary antibodies are light sensitive and fade in daylight. Protect slides from this step onward from light.
23 Remove the secondary antibody solution.
24 Wash three times for 5 min with blocking solution.
25 Check briefly under a microscope for nuclear staining (DAPI) and antibody signal.
26 (Optional) If co-staining, repeat steps 20–26 for the following primary/secondary antibody. For subsequent secondary antibody incubations, the addition of DAPI is not needed. Co-staining is highly recommended.
27 Perform a final wash with distilled water and briefly air-dry slides at RT for 10 min.
28 Add three drops of Mowiol onto the slide and place a glass coverslip (24 × 50 mm) onto the slide, carefully avoiding air bubbles.
29 Let the slide with Mowiol to dry for 1 h at RT, always protecting from light.
30 Store slides for long-term storage at 4 °C in the dark until microscopic analysis, either with a widefield, or if accessable, preferably with a confocal microscope.
