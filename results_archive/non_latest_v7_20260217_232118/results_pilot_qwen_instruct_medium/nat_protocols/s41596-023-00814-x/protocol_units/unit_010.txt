1 Collect up to three OVB organoids of the same batch in a sterile Rnase-free 1.5 ml tube. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for transferring organoids.
2 Remove any carried-over medium carefully with a 200 µl micropipette tip without disturbing the organoids.
3 Wash organoids once with cold PBS and withdraw PBS.
4 Add 300 µl Tri-Reagent and incubate at RT for 5 min.
5 Vortex tube three times for 5 s.
6 Incubate the tube at RT for 5 min without agitation.
7 Vortex tube three times for 5 s.
8 Keep the tube on ice for 10 min.
9 Vortex tube three times for 5 s.
10 Keep the tube on ice for 10 min.
11 Freeze organoids by a snap freeze on dry ice and store them at −80 °C overnight.
PAUSE POINT Store organoids in Tri-Reagent at −80 °C for up to 6 months.
12 Thaw organoids in Tri-reagent at RT.
13 Vortex the tube times for 5 s.
14 Pipette remaining cell clumps up and down for complete dissociation with 200 µl micropipette tips (filtered, Rnase-free tip).
15 Perform phenol/chloroform extraction to separate nucleic acids from lipids and proteins. Extract RNA with a commercially available RNA extraction kit.
16 Use 2 µg of total RNA to subselect poly(A)+ transcripts and generate strand-specific cDNA libraries.
17 Sequence libraries to ~50 million read pairs each (75 bp reads) on a HiSeq4000 platform (Illumina).
18 Assess data sequencing quality with FastQC and map paired-end sequencing reads with STAR aligner to Hg19 human reference assembly and quantified with featureCounts.
19 Normalize raw read counts with the RUVSeq package in R to remove unwanted variation based on replicate samples (RUVs).
20 Analyze changes in differential gene expression (DGE) with the DESeq2 package. The list of 3,923 significantly DGE genes (log2FC ±1.5 and padj ≤0.05 cutoff) is subjected to affinity propagation clustering based on similarity matrix, with the APcluster package.
21 Generate a dendrogram with clusters, cutoff and superclusters, and use these for Gene Ontology term search analysis with clusterProfiler. Classify significant DGE genes in superclusters and subject them to gene set enrichment analysis with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (v3.0) using C5 collection of Gene Ontology gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database.
