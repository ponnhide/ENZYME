1 Collect up to five OVB organoids on day 30 or day 60 in a sterile 1 ml tube. Use a cut 1,000 µl micropipette tip for transferring organoids.
2 Remove any carried-over medium carefully with a 200 µl micropipette tip without disturbing the organoids.
3 Wash organoids once with 1 ml of DMEM/F12 (prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath) for 3 min and remove the DMEM/F12.
4 Add 1 ml PFA (prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath) and incubate the tube at RT for 30–60 min.
CRITICAL STEP Do not exceed the time of PFA fixation above 1 h since this will lead to high autofluorescence. Use with 37 °C water bath warmed PFA to fix the organoids to enhance penetration of PFA and preserve the cytoskeleton of the cells, since cold treatment leads to depolymerization of microtubules.
5 Remove PFA and wash three times with PBS-Glycine for 3 min at RT.
PAUSE POINT Organoids can be stored for up to 2 months in PBS-Glycine at 4 °C.
6 To dehydrate organoids before freezing, add 1 ml of 30% sucrose solution and keep at 4 °C overnight. When organoids are fully dehydrated, they will sink down to the bottom of the tube.
PAUSE POINT Organoids can be stored for up to 2 weeks in sucrose solution at 4 °C.
7 Prepare Tissue-Tek Cryomold containing Tissue-Tek OCT Compound solution. Transfer the dehydrated organoids with a cut 200 µl micropipette tip or an inoculation loop, from the sucrose solution tube into the OCT mold. Place one organoid in the center of the mold and orient it to either cut median or horizontal sections. The pigmented area should face the sides and not the bottom of the mold’s opening.
8 Place the mold with organoids immediately at −80 °C for deep freezing and store them until continuing the procedure, with a minimum time of 24 h.
PAUSE POINT Molds with organoids can be stored up to 1 year at −80 °C.
