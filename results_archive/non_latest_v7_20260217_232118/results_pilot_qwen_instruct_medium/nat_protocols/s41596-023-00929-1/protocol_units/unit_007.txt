16. Carefully dispense cell suspension from each sample tube into the new conical tubes containing 22% Percoll in equal amounts. Use ~750 µL per tube.
▲ Critical step The cell suspension should be dispensed on top of the Percoll.
17. Spin down for 10 min at 500g, 4 °C with no deceleration.
18. Discard supernatant.
19. Reunite contents of all Percoll tubes into one tube by resuspending the cell pellet in the HBSS/BSA/glucose remaining after pouring out the supernatant.
20. Spin down the sample tube for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.
