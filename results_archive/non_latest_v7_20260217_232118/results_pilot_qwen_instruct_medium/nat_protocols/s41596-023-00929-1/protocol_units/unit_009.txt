24. After samples have finished spinning, discard supernatant.
25. Resuspend in ~200 µL of HBSS/BSA/glucose.
26. Add the master mix into the tube of resuspended cells.
27. Incubate for 15 min on ice. During this sample incubation, start preparing controls by following Steps 36–45.
28. Wash with 5 mL of HBSS/BSA/glucose and mix.
29. Spin down for 5 min at 300g, 4 °C.
30. Discard supernatant.
 • Note the amount of supernatant remaining in the tube; 500 µL of supernatant is needed to resuspend
 • Add additional HBSS/BSA/glucose if below the recommended 500 µL needed to resuspend
31. Resuspend cells.
