32. Obtain one FACS tube and a 70 µm filter.
33. With the filter over the FACS tube, dispense the resuspended cells through the filter and into the FACS tube.
34. Seal the tube and place on ice.
▲ Critical step Cells should be analyzed as soon as possible. Longer periods of dissociation may compromise cell viability.
35. Take samples to FACS.
