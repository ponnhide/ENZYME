Day 45: dissociating hSO and sorting Dlxi1/2b::GFP+ and Dlxi1/2b::GFP− cells
● TIMING 8 h
30. Pool 12 organoids into one well of a six-well plate along with 3 ml of enzyme solution
 with papain (10 U ml−1). Incubate the plate with organoids at 37 °C for 15 min in a 5% CO2
 incubator. Gently shake the plate horizontally every 5 min to evenly distribute the papain
 solution. Both control and genetically perturbed hSO should be dissociated at this step,
 because control (uninfected) cells will be needed to set the gate for FACS.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Mix the enzyme solution with the appropriate amount of papain and pre-
 warm the mixed solution at 37 °C for 20 min before dissociation of the organoids to activate
 the enzyme. The concentration of papain and incubation time are critical for the yield of
 the dissociation. Optimize these parameters if working with a different type of organoids or
 organoids at a different stage of differentiation.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP The protocol described here is for dissociation of an individual sample
 consisting of 12 organoids. The yield does not increase linearly with more starting materials.
 We pool 12 organoids as one sample for this step.

31. After digestion, transfer the sample and enzyme solution to a 15-ml conical tube.
32. Centrifuge the 15-ml conical tube for 30 s at 200g. After centrifugation, remove the
 supernatant and add 1 ml of low-ovo solution. Centrifuge the 15-ml conical tube for 30 s
 at 200g. Wash one more time with 1 ml of low-ovo solution and then add 1 ml of low-ovo
 solution to the sample.
33. Mechanically dissociate the organoids by sequentially pipetting a few times with a P1000
 tip. After pipetting, no large chunks of cells should be visible. Transfer ~800 μl of the
 supernatant to a new 15-ml conical tube.
34. Pipette the remaining cell chunks a few times with a P200 tip and transfer ~180 μl of the
 supernatant to the same conical tube. Finally, pipette a few times with a P20 tip to break the
 leftover debris and transfer the remaining supernatant to the same conical tube.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP Pipette slowly and gently to maintain optimal cell viability. Transferring
 the supernatant between each round of pipetting is needed to avoid repeated pipetting of
 dissociated cells.
 ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING
35. Spin down the cell suspension at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C.
36. Aspirate the supernatant and then resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of 3% BSA (wt/vol) diluted
 in 1× DPBS supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.
37. Filter the cells through a 50-μm pore filter into a 15-ml low-binding tube.
38. Count the cells manually by using a Bright-Line hemacytometer.
39. Collect Dlxi1/2b::GFP+ and Dlxi1/2b::GFP− populations through FACS. Use cells dissociated
 from control hSO as a negative control to set up the gate for FACS. Conduct FACS at 4 °C and
 collect cells in a low-binding 15-ml conical tube containing 5 ml of NM supplemented with
 10% FBS (vol/vol) and 20 μM Y-27632.
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP It is critical to collect a sufficient number of cells. Test the number/
 percentage of Dlxi1/2b::GFP+ cells that you can get through FACS from a certain number of
 organoids to decide on the number of organoids that will be used for the experiment.
 ■ PAUSE POINT Store the collected cells at –80 °C until the next step.
