Days 3–6: neural induction
● TIMING 4 d, ~0.5–3 h per d
25. From day 3 to day 6, perform medium change daily. Carefully remove the medium by using
 a 10-ml serological pipette and replace it with 10 ml of E6 medium supplemented with
dorsomorphin (2.5 μM), SB-431542 (10 μM) and XAV-939 (1.25 μM).
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP If the organoids fuse to each other, pipette the clusters of organoids
 up and down a few times gently with a 10-ml serological pipette to separate them. If some
 fusions cannot be separated through pipetting, it is fine to leave them as is. Minimize the
 time that the cultures are kept outside of the incubator at all stages of the differentiation.

Days 7–44: patterning and differentiation
● TIMING 39 d, ~0.5–3 h per d
26. From day 7 to day 12, perform medium change daily. Carefully remove the medium by using
 a 10-ml serological pipette and replace it with 15 ml of fresh NM supplemented with EGF
 (20 ng ml−1), FGF2 (20 ng ml−1) and XAV-939 (1.25 μM).
27. From day 13 to day 16, perform medium change daily with NM supplemented with EGF
 (20 ng ml−1), FGF2 (20 ng ml−1), XAV-939 (1.25 μM) and Smoothened agonist (SAG, 100 nM).
28. From day 18 to day 24, perform medium change every other day by using NM supplemented
 with EGF (20 ng ml−1), FGF2 (20 ng ml−1), XAV-939 (1.25 μM) and SAG (100 nM).
29. From day 26 to day 44, perform medium change every other day by using NM supplemented
 with BDNF (20 ng ml−1) and NT3 (20 ng ml−1).
 ▲ CRITICAL STEP At this stage, if the organoids still tend to fuse with each other, gently
 separate the fused organoids with a P20 tip to maintain healthy organoids. Limit the
 number of organoids to no more than 30 per 10-cm dish to ensure adequate nutrient
 availability for each organoid.
