Vortex the plate at low speed for 30 s and then centrifuge the plate for 5 min at 500g.\n69. Mix 300 pmol of sgRNA with 40 pmol of Cas9 protein in a V-shaped 96-well plate to form\n an RNP complex for sgRNAs targeting each gene. The stock of our sgRNAs was 100 pmol μl−1\n and the Cas9 was 20 pmol μl−1. Therefore, the total volume of our mix was 5 μl.\n70. Incubate the RNPs at room temperature for 10 min and then place them on ice until use.\n\nPreparing the cell suspension\n71. Aspirate the medium from hiPS cells cultured in six-well plates and wash the cells twice\n with DPBS.\n72. Add 1 ml of pre-warmed Accutase to each well. Incubate at 37 °C for 7 min in a 5% CO2\n incubator.\n73. Add 1 ml of pre-warmed E8 medium per well to the cells and collect the suspensions into 15-ml\n conical tubes. Gently pipette the cell suspension a few times with a serological pipette to ensure\n that any remining clumps are fully dissociated. Centrifuge the samples at 200g for 5 min.\n74. Aspirate the supernatant and then resuspend the cells in E8 medium supplemented with\n 10 μM Y-27632. Count the cells manually by using a Bright-Line hemacytometer.\n75. We use 0.5 million hiPS cells per nucleofection reaction. To generate 15 KO cell pools for\n 15 target genes, plus one negative control, a total of 8 million cells is required. An additional\n 1 million cells are included to account for potential loss during the process. Therefore,\n transfer 9 million cells to a new 15-ml Falcon tube and centrifuge at 200g for 5 min.\n76. Aspirate the supernatant completely and resuspend the cells with 360 μl of nucleofection\n solution.\n\nPreparing cell/RNP solution\n77. Transfer 20 μl of the hiPS cell suspension into each well of the 96-well plate containing 5 μl\n of RNP complex. Mix two to three times through pipetting.\n\nNucleofection\n78. Transfer each cell-RNP mixture (25 μl) to each well of the Nucleocuvette strips. Click the lid\n tight.\n79. Gently tap the strip on the benchtop to make sure that the sample covers the bottom of the\n cuvette and that there are no bubbles in the wells.\n\n80. Place the Nucleocuvette strips with closed lid into the retainer of the 4D-Nucleofector X\n unit. Check for proper orientation of the Nucleocuvette strips.\n81. Start the nucleofection process by using the CA137 program.\n ▲ CRITICAL STEP Nucleofection efficiency and cell survival rate differ greatly when using\n different nucleofection programs. We tested multiple nucleofection programs and found\n that the current program resulted in high nucleofection efficiency and minimal cell death.\n Optimize nucleofection programs on the basis of specific cell types.\n82. After run completion, carefully remove the Nucleocuvette strips from the retainer. Add\n 70 μl of pre-warmed E8 supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 to resuspend the cells. Mix the\n cells by gently pipetting up and down two to three times.",

Because three sgRNAs were used per candidate\n gene (Fig. 4a), we expect the KO cells to exhibit segmental deletions. As a result, PCR\n amplification from KO cells will produce a smaller amplicon. In cases of high KO efficiency,\n only the smaller KO band is detected (Fig. 4b).\n86. NGS sequencing of the target gene. For a detailed analysis of mutation types generated by\n the KO, subject the PCR amplicon to NGS. In scenarios with high KO efficiency, only a small\n fraction of PCR amplicons originate from control cells (Fig. 4c–e).\n87. Western blotting. To confirm the KO at the protein level, perform western blotting to assess\n the expression of the protein encoded by the target gene. In cases in which KO efficiency\n is high, minimal or no protein expression is observed, with only trace amounts potentially\n originating from control cells (Fig. 4f–h).\n ◆ TROUBLESHOOTING",
